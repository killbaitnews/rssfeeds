According to a report cited by The Sun, Kardashian traveled from Los Angeles to England on Saturday via her private jet specifically to meet Hamilton. The pair allegedly stayed at Estelle Manor, an exclusive country club and luxury hotel in the Cotswolds known for catering to high-profile guests seeking privacy.

Sources quoted in the report described the weekend as highly discreet and romantic. It was claimed that Kardashian and Hamilton were accompanied by security guards throughout their stay to minimize contact with other guests. The report further alleged that the two shared a room and were given exclusive access to parts of the property, including the spa and pool facilities. One insider stated that the couple booked a private couple’s massage and dined i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kim-kardashian-and-lewis-hamilton-reportedly-spend-a-private-weekend-together-in-the-uk</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kim-kardashian-and-lewis-hamilton-reportedly-spend-a-private-weekend-together-in-the-uk</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cardi B Sets Clear Boundaries in Relationship with Stefon Diggs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cardi B and NFL player Stefon Diggs have experienced a complicated relationship since becoming a couple in 2025. According to recent reports, Cardi B has established strict boundaries with Diggs, emphasizing that loyalty and transparency are non-negotiable. This comes after Diggs became a father to four children with four different women within the past year, including a son with Cardi B. Sources reveal that Cardi has clearly communicated that if Diggs were to cheat or have a child without her knowledge, she would end the relationship. Despite these challenges, Cardi reportedly entered the relationship fully aware of Diggs’ reputation and past relationships, trusting him to be faithful since they became official. The couple is said to be focusing on creating a stable family environment, discussing parenting strategies, and maintaining respectful relationships with Diggs’ other children and their mothers.

The Puerto Rican artist paused before offering traditional thank-yous to deliver a pointed message that criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and called for empathy toward immigrant communities.

Standing before an audience of industry peers, Bad Bunny opened his remarks by declaring 'ICE out,' a statement that immediately drew a strong reaction from the crowd. He then challenged dehumanizing rhetoric often directed at immigrants, emphasizing that they are not criminals or outsiders but human beings who are part of American society. Speaking deliberately, he underscored themes of dignity and belonging, framing immigration as a human issue rather than a political talking point.

The artist also reflected on the emotional toll of polarized political climates, ac]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bad-bunny-uses-grammy-acceptance-speech-to-call-for-compassion-on-immigration</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bad-bunny-uses-grammy-acceptance-speech-to-call-for-compassion-on-immigration</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iran, China, and Russia Establish Trilateral Strategic Framework for Cooperation]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 29, 2026, Iran, China, and Russia officially signed a comprehensive strategic pact, marking a significant development in 21st-century international relations. While the full text of the agreement is being released gradually, the three governments have described it as a cornerstone of a new international order. The pact builds upon previous bilateral agreements: Iran and Russia's 20-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and Iran and China's 25-year Cooperation Agreement aimed at trade, infrastructure, and energy integration. The new trilateral framework aligns the three countries on issues such as nuclear sovereignty, economic cooperation, military coordination, and diplomatic strategy. Importantly, it does not constitute a binding mutual defense treaty like NATO’s Article 5, but it signals a political coalition united against unilateral military and economic pressures from the West. The agreement strengthens Iran's position in the Middle East, providing strategic leverag]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-china-and-russia-establish-trilateral-strategic-framework-for-cooperation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-china-and-russia-establish-trilateral-strategic-framework-for-cooperation</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vivian Wilson Reflects on Childhood Caribbean Travels Amid Release of Epstein-Related Emails Involving Elon Musk]]></title><description><![CDATA[Freshly released documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein have brought renewed attention to Elon Musk's past interactions with Epstein, highlighting attempts by Musk to visit Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. The documents, obtained from the US Department of Justice, include email exchanges from 2012 and 2013 where Musk coordinated possible visits with Epstein. Despite multiple plans, including discussions around holiday travel and parties, none of the visits appear to have occurred due to scheduling or logistical conflicts. In response to the circulating emails, Musk’s estranged daughter, Vivian Wilson, shared a memory of childhood trips in the region, recalling boat rides between St. Vincent and St. Barth’s during holiday seasons and the dark night sea she remembered. Vivian, around nine years old during the time of these emails, has publicly distanced herself from Musk, legally changing her name in 2022.

The operation, widely publicized as part of Russia's so-called 'ghost fleet,' faced immediate legal scrutiny. Under French law, the seizure was considered illegal, forcing authorities to release the vessel. French President Macron acknowledged in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky that the current legal framework was insufficient and indicated plans to amend domestic legislation to allow future actions against Russian tankers to comply with the law. The tanker had departed from Murmansk, Russia, and although initially claimed to be without a flag, it was actually registered under the Comoros flag. Images circulated by the French Navy depicted assault troops on the bridge, inspecting the ship's papers, resembling routine traffic enforcement procedures. While the initial seizure received extensive media attention, the release occurred discr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-releases-seized-russian-tanker-following-legal-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-releases-seized-russian-tanker-following-legal-concerns</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 12:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lily Allen Considers Releasing Previously Shelved Album Addressing Personal Trauma in Music Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lily Allen, the British singer-songwriter, may be preparing to release an unreleased album that deals with deeply personal experiences of abuse and bullying within the music industry. The project, reportedly created five years ago, was initially shelved by her former label BMG due to a dip in her popularity at the time. According to sources cited by Daily Mail, the album reflects a difficult period in Allen's life, including alleged sexual abuse by a powerful music executive and harassment by other industry figures. With the success of her recent album 'West End Girl,' which focused on themes of infidelity and heartbreak, Allen's public profile and influence have grown significantly. This shift could allow her more control over the release of previously withheld material. While Allen has not publicly named the individuals involved, fans and industry observers are already discussing the potential impact of the album, particularly in the context of increasing attention to accountability ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lily-allen-considers-releasing-previously-shelved-album-addressing-personal-trauma-in-music-industry</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lily-allen-considers-releasing-previously-shelved-album-addressing-personal-trauma-in-music-industry</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analysis of Alleged Death Toll and Propaganda Surrounding Iranian Protests]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses claims made by various NGOs and media outlets regarding the number of deaths during protests in Iran. It highlights that figures vary widely, ranging from as low as 3,117 deaths reported by Iranian authorities to exaggerated claims of up to 80,000 deaths circulating on social media and opposition outlets. The piece emphasizes that many of these organizations, including the ICHR, HRAI, and UANI, are linked to foreign governments or interests, particularly the United States and Israel, suggesting that the dissemination of inflated figures serves geopolitical and ideological purposes. Examples include unverified stories of protesters hiding in body bags and reports spread by networks of bots. The article positions these narratives as part of a historical pattern, drawing parallels with past propaganda campaigns used to justify military interventions, such as in Iraq, Libya, and Syria.

It describes Hezbollah as an integral extension of Iran's military apparatus, bound by ideological loyalty under the Wilayat al-Faqih doctrine and structural command integration with the IRGC. The group is portrayed as a versatile 'queen' on the regional chessboard, capable of unleashing a massive rocket arsenal to strike northern Israel, opening a multi-front war and serving as Tehran's forward defense. Quotes from figures like former US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta emphasize Hezbollah as Tehran's most potent retaliatory force, while Israeli analyst Yaakov Amidror notes its automatic activation when Iran is threatened.

The decision stems from repeated breaches of diplomatic protocol, including public statements from Israel's mission insulting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and failure to notify authorities of visits by senior Israeli officials. This marks a significant escalation in tensions between Pretoria and Tel Aviv, which already have strained relations following South Africa's 2023 complaint against Israel at the International Court of Justice over alleged acts of genocide in Gaza. Israel responded in kind by declaring Shaun Edward Byneveldt, South Africa's top diplomat in Israel, persona non grata with the same 72-hour deadline.

The bench transitions in color from deep marine blues to almost transparent tones, mimicking the effect of sunlight on water. Its design gives the impression of fluid motion, resembling a frozen wave, while remaining fully functional as seating for two people. What sets Cresta apart is its sustainable construction: it is crafted from recycled plastics, including acrylic, PET, and polycarbonate, transforming waste materials into a tactile and visually striking piece of furniture. The vertical textures on the bench scatter light, changing its appearance throughout the day, and occasionally glowing, making it as much a piece of art as a practical object. Cresta demonstrates that eco-friendly design can be bold and aesthetically pleasing, rather than subtle or understated.

In a recent interview with Attitude magazine, Hilton shared that the two have been talking about recording together and have revisited the idea during recent meetups. While she stopped short of confirming anything concrete, Hilton expressed genuine enthusiasm, describing a collaboration with Spears as a dream scenario and calling it something that would be 'the most iconic thing ever.'

The conversations come at a time when Hilton is actively immersed in music again. She is currently developing her third studio album, following her self-titled debut released in 2006 and her 2024 comeback album, Infinite Icon. Her renewed focus on music has made the idea of a collaboration with Spears feel more plausible, even if it remains in the early stages.

Writing on X, Musk said that his emails had been “misinterpreted” and insisted that he never visited Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean nor traveled on his private aircraft. According to Musk, he repeatedly declined invitations to do so, despite maintaining limited correspondence with Epstein years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for sex crimes involving minors.

The newly released documents contain emails from 2012 and 2013 in which Musk appeared to discuss potential visits to the Caribbean and asked Epstein about parties or suitable dates to meet. Some messages referenced helicopters, travel logistics, and the possibility of visiting Epstein’s island. While the emails suggest a friendly tone, it remains unclear whether any visit ever took ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/elon-musk-denies-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-s-island-amid-renewed-scrutiny-of-released-emails</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/elon-musk-denies-visiting-jeffrey-epstein-s-island-amid-renewed-scrutiny-of-released-emails</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Justice Department Releases Extensive Epstein Files, Revealing High-Level Contacts and Unverified Allegations]]></title><description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Justice has released what it describes as the largest disclosure to date of documents related to convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein, comprising millions of pages, images, and videos. According to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the release concludes a lengthy review process intended to balance transparency with the protection of ongoing investigations and victims’ identities. The files offer insight into Epstein’s activities during his incarceration and his communications with numerous prominent individuals.

Among the materials are emails and records referencing Epstein’s interactions with political leaders, business figures, and members of European royalty.

According to the piece, Trump made the accusation in a post on his Truth Social account, claiming that Obama and his associates were involved in what he described as a “coup” against his presidency. Trump asserted that newly released documents related to the long-running investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election support his claims.

The article states that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard allegedly released a large number of documents connected to the so-called “Russiagate” controversy. Trump is quoted as saying these materials prove that Obama personally ordered intelligence agencies to fabricate information intended to damage Trump and weaken public trust in the electoral process.

Speaking on Fox Business, Schiff claims that accelerating inflation, growing federal debt, and declining global confidence in the U.S. dollar could lead to a severe financial crisis, potentially worse than the 2008 recession. He suggests that central banks around the world are reducing their holdings of U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds while increasing gold reserves, which he interprets as preparation for a dollar and sovereign debt crisis.

Schiff criticizes the current economic indicators cited by the Trump administration and its supporters, arguing that official data on growth, inflation, and productivity are distorted by inflation and are likely to be revised downward.

Though Musk did not ultimately visit the island due to scheduling conflicts, the exchanges depict a more cordial and friendly rapport between the two men than Musk has publicly admitted. Musk has long denied any substantial connection to Epstein, previously calling the financier a 'creep' and rejecting claims that Epstein tried to involve him in activities at his island.

Epstein's messages criticize Gates for ending their friendship and describe morally questionable requests. Gates has long denied any wrongdoing and has stated he regrets knowing Epstein. The documents also contain photographs of Gates with Epstein and others, including one where a woman's face is redacted.

Among them are email exchanges from December 2013 involving Elon Musk, Epstein, and Epstein's longtime assistant Lesley Groff. The correspondence indicates Musk, while in the Virgin Islands area, asked Epstein about a suitable time to visit Little St. James island between January 1-8, 2014. Epstein responded positively, stating 'any day 1st - 8th... always space for you.' A follow-up redacted email referenced organizing Musk's arrival for January 2.

While the U.S. largely relies on the Imperial system for measurements, efforts to adopt the metric system have been made over the years. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, signed under President Jimmy Carter, aimed to make the metric system the preferred standard for commerce and public works. As part of this initiative, the highway from Tucson to Nogales was built with kilometer-based signage and exit numbering. However, nationwide conversion efforts failed, mainly due to high costs and cultural attachment to the Imperial system. By 1982, President Ronald Reagan officially ended the metric conversion campaign, leaving Interstate 19 as a rare legacy. Local attempts to switch the highway to miles have been unsuccessful, and Arizona maintains parallel mile-based signs for operational purposes, invisible to drivers.

Huerta Chuma, who was the target of a Border Patrol operation that day, described being followed by agents while driving for rideshare work, fleeing on foot, and hiding in a local business for about four hours. From inside, he saw Pretti arrive, film the agents, and get tackled after agents pushed a woman nearby. He stated that Pretti did not appear to reach for or use his firearm, yet agents fired multiple shots after disarming him. Huerta Chuma expressed deep guilt and distress over Pretti's death, describing him as a good person and questioning why he was killed. DHS initially labeled Huerta Chuma a 'violent criminal illegal alien' and claimed Pretti intended to massacre agents, but his record shows only misdemeanors (including a 2018 disorderly co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ecuadorian-immigrant-witness-to-fatal-shooting-of-alex-pretti-by-border-patrol-agents-speaks-out-while-in-hiding</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ecuadorian-immigrant-witness-to-fatal-shooting-of-alex-pretti-by-border-patrol-agents-speaks-out-while-in-hiding</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Escalation of Russian Attacks Disrupts Ukraine’s Railway Infrastructure and Civil Logistics]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports a recent intensification of Russian attacks targeting Ukraine’s railway network, a critical component of the country’s civilian and economic infrastructure. According to Ukrainian authorities, multiple railway assets were struck within a 24-hour period, including active trains, tracks, electrical substations, and technical buildings. In the Kharkiv region, a train was reportedly hit by drones, illustrating the increasing vulnerability of rail transport to aerial attacks. The Ukrainian government emphasizes that these incidents are not isolated but form part of a deliberate campaign aimed at undermining a system essential to daily life and economic stability.

Prime Minister Yuliya Svyrydenko condemned the strikes, describing them as intentional attacks on civilian logistics.

In total, only around 764,000 vehicles rolled off production lines last year, representing a sharp decline of 15.5% compared with the previous year. This downturn highlights the structural vulnerabilities of the sector and the impact of external shocks on the UK’s industrial base.

Two main factors explain the contraction. The first was the imposition of tariffs by the United States on British-made vehicles. Although these tariffs were eventually reduced from an initial 27.5% to 10%, the bilateral agreement between Washington and London only applies to a quota of 100,000 vehicles per year. This limitation significantly constrained exports and reduced the competitiveness of UK carmakers in one of their key markets.

Instead, she stressed the need for a comprehensive, impartial, and transparent investigation that examines all possible parties involved in the incident.

Zakharova stated that Moscow has consistently called for full disclosure of investigative findings related to the Nord Stream explosions and has criticized what it views as selective leaks and speculative reporting in some Western media.

According to police and local media reports, the young woman was waiting on the platform at around 10:07 p.m. when the man, identified as a Sudanese national, suddenly grabbed her and dragged her onto the tracks as a train was approaching. Both individuals were struck by the train and died at the scene.

Witnesses told investigators that the man had been walking along the platform prior to the incident and appeared to be intoxicated. One eyewitness reported hearing him say, 'I'll take you with me,' moments before he pulled the woman onto the tracks without warning.

Historically, cardholders could easily track their progress toward this cap because Chase displayed rewards activity based on the cardmember year, resetting the tracker at each card anniversary.

According to Frequent Miler, Chase has recently changed how this information is shown in its online account interface and mobile app. Instead of tracking bonus earnings from the cardmember anniversary date, the rewards tracker now displays spending as if it were tied to the calendar year, for example showing activity 'since January 2026.'

These sanctions, described as unprecedented in severity, included border closures, the freezing of Malian state assets held at the Central Bank of West African States, and the suspension of commercial and financial transactions. Mali’s transitional government immediately denounced the measures as inhumane and unlawful.

Three years later, the court based in Ouagadougou issued a judgment overturning the sanctions that had been adopted during an extraordinary summit in Accra, Ghana.

Designed by the studio STIPFOLD, the project explores how high-altitude hospitality can be both minimal and welcoming without imposing itself on an extreme landscape. Rather than relying on dramatic gestures, the design emphasizes restraint, functionality, and harmony with its surroundings.

The structure is conceived as a small shelter for limited groups, featuring a simple internal layout and a lofted sleeping area oriented toward the expansive mountain views. Its defining exterior element is a continuous fiber-concrete shell, sculpted to resemble a natural boulder. This form allows the building to visually recede into the terrain, reinforcing the idea that architecture should serve as a quiet frame for nature rather than a focal point competing with it.

Inside, the atmosphere shifts subtly from rugged to warm.

From the frantic mother in Home Alone to the eccentric Moira Rose in Schitt’s Creek, O’Hara had a rare gift for making audiences feel both laughter and empathy simultaneously. Her work on SCTV helped shape modern comedy, while her performances in Beetlejuice and other films turned unusual characters into memorable, relatable figures. Beyond her impeccable timing and skill, what truly set O’Hara apart was her warmth. Even her most over-the-top roles carried a softness and honesty that resonated with viewers.

Rauch explains that fascism is often poorly defined and overused, but insists that recent developments have made the comparison unavoidable. While Trump’s first term could largely be understood as patrimonialism—treating the state as a personal possession—the author contends that the administration has since evolved toward a more coherent and aggressive ideology consistent with fascism.

Rauch identifies fascism not as a single policy or act, but as a constellation of traits that become clear when viewed together. These include the deliberate demolition of civic norms, glorification of violence, and the embrace of a “might makes right” worldview. He highlights Trump’s rhetoric praising brutality, his administration’s public celebration of force, and the transformation of ICE into a powerful national paramilitary]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-trump-s-second-term-governing-style-fits-the-historical-definition-of-fascism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-trump-s-second-term-governing-style-fits-the-historical-definition-of-fascism</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fed Chair Powell States Inflation Above 2% Target Largely Due to Tariffs, Expects Peak and Decline in 2026 as Fed Holds Rates Steady]]></title><description><![CDATA[Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed the current inflation situation during a press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to maintain the key policy rate at 3.50%-3.75%. This marked a pause after three prior 25-basis-point rate cuts. Powell indicated that inflation, particularly core PCE, was estimated around 3% in December, remaining well above the Fed's 2% target. He attributed most of this elevation to price pressures in the goods sector driven by tariffs, emphasizing that 'most of the overrun in inflation is from tariffs, not demand.' In contrast, disinflation continues in the services sector. Powell highlighted that excluding tariff effects, core PCE runs just slightly above 2%, describing this as a positive sign. He views tariffs as causing a one-time price increase, expecting their impact to peak and then decline over the course of 2026, assuming no major new tariff impositions.

Designed by Canadian brand Beachman, the model draws heavy inspiration from 1960s British café racers, combining nostalgic aesthetics with contemporary electric engineering. Its low-profile silhouette, bubble-style windscreen, slim tires, and exposed frame evoke the romance of vintage European motorcycling, while carefully integrating modern components in a way that feels refined rather than technical.

At the heart of the Street Spec is a removable lithium battery, offered in two configurations: a 2.8 kWh pack providing up to 55 miles of range, and an optional 3.6 kWh version extending range to around 70 miles. Both options support regenerative braking and feature built-in charging ports.

Major crops such as corn, soybeans, and cotton are experiencing dramatic losses, with net farm income projected to drop by $41 billion this year, one of the steepest declines in decades. Tariffs imposed during the Trump administration have severely impacted U.S. exports, particularly to China, while strict immigration policies have further strained the agricultural labor force, leaving many fields unharvested.

While China will mainly rely on solar energy for the station, Russia proposes to add a nuclear fission reactor to significantly increase available power and expand scientific capabilities. Despite political tensions following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the resulting budgetary and credibility issues affecting Roscosmos, nuclear space technology remains an area where Russia retains notable expertise.

To implement this contribution, Roscosmos plans a dedicated program called KS-LES (Lunar Energy Station Space Complex). It consists of three heavy spacecraft to be launched between 2033 and 2035.

Gunfire and explosions near Air Base 101 triggered an immediate military response. According to the government, the attackers were mercenaries, some of whom were quickly neutralized. General Abdourahamane Tiani personally visited the site to oversee operations and meet with key military officers. He highlighted the crucial support of Russian forces, which helped contain the attack in under twenty minutes, preventing severe damage. General Tiani also emphasized the importance of continued vigilance and strengthened coordination with Russian partners to safeguard strategic airport infrastructure. In his statement, he suggested that certain foreign nations, including France and neighboring countries, may have supported the mercenaries.

By repurposing old books, printed pages, and vintage photographs, Joosen transforms static text into lively visual narratives that give words a physical presence. His compositions often depict miniature figures interacting directly with language itself—mowing through lines of text like grass, harvesting words from a printed page, or rearranging letters as if they were tangible objects.

Joosen’s approach is rooted in an appreciation for traditional print culture. The use of aged paper and old-fashioned imagery gives his work a nostalgic quality, evoking a time when books were central, tactile objects rather than digital files. At the same time, the concepts behind the collages feel fresh and inventive. By turning reading into a visual metaphor, Joosen invites viewers to reconsider how meaning is constructed an]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dutch-artist-toon-joosen-reimagines-language-through-playful-paper-collage</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dutch-artist-toon-joosen-reimagines-language-through-playful-paper-collage</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Avianca LifeMiles+ Subscription Offers Value Through Discounts and Sweet Spots for Europe Business Class Awards]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the renewed appeal of Avianca LifeMiles+ subscription service for enthusiasts, detailing its tiers (Lite at $20/month, Basic at $50/month, Pro at $100/month, Max at $200/month) that provide monthly mile allotments to extend expiration, a 10% discount on award redemptions, and free changes/cancellations on Basic or higher plans. Discounts apply for Amex Elite cardholders. The author analyzes value based on mile valuations (1-2 cents each), recommending Lite for discount and expiration protection or Basic for cancellation flexibility, given high fees up to $200 per ticket otherwise. Recent favorable pricing to Europe revives interest, with business class often at 69K-80K miles one-way (reduced further by discount), and a notable sweet spot from JFK to Zurich at 55K miles (49.5K discounted), plus mixed-cabin options as low as 45.5K.

This change, set to begin in March 2026, will make it possible for managers to see not only whether employees are at their desks but also where they are when working remotely. Connecting to non-company Wi-Fi networks, such as public hotspots, will reveal the network name to managers, eliminating the generic 'Remote' status as a privacy shield. Microsoft describes the feature as optional, with tracking limited to working hours and automatic deletion of history, but there are concerns that employers could make it mandatory. While Microsoft presents the functionality as a tool for better coordination and productivity, critics argue that it raises significant privacy concerns for hybrid and remote workers.

Centurion Lounges, particularly at major U.S. airports, have struggled with long wait times and capacity issues, a problem that mirrors challenges faced by other lounge programs such as Delta Sky Clubs and Priority Pass. These new changes will take effect on July 8 and are described as minor but meaningful refinements to existing policies.

The first change affects cardholders who qualify for guest access by spending at least $75,000 per calendar year on their Platinum or Business Platinum cards. Under the new rule, guests must be traveling on the same flight as the eligible cardmember in order to enter the lounge. Previously, this requirement was not explicitly enforced, allowing some cardmembers to host colleagues or acquaintances traveling separately.

Trump made the remarks during a Washington summit focused on the administration’s new “Trump Accounts” initiative for children. In a lighthearted but pointed riff, Trump praised Cruz as a tough and brilliant legal mind and claimed that, if nominated, Cruz would receive unanimous Senate support. Trump argued that both Democrats and Republicans would support the nomination, joking that lawmakers in both parties would be eager to see Cruz leave the Senate.

The comments come amid persistent discussion about possible Supreme Court retirements in the near future. While no justice has formally announced plans to step down, attention has focused on the age of several members of the court.

The U.S. has bolstered its military presence in the Persian Gulf, including the deployment of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and escort ships, signaling a show of force. Inside the administration, however, there are conflicting approaches: some advocate for immediate military action, while others push for continued diplomacy and measured provocations to destabilize Iran without triggering open war. In response, Iran has mobilized its navy and announced joint naval exercises with Russia and China in the Gulf of Oman and the Indian Ocean, reinforcing its preparedness.

The debate has intensified amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe, including disputes related to Greenland and renewed uncertainty about the long-term commitment of the United States to European security.

Rutte argued that the creation of a separate European military force would weaken, rather than strengthen, Europe’s defense posture. According to him, such a move would introduce unnecessary complexity and deepen fragmentation within European defense structures. He provocatively stated that an independent European army would be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, as it would complicate decision-making and undermine cohesion within NATO.

The detentions followed ICE operations in Minneapolis on January 9, during which four Oglala Sioux citizens were taken into custody. Three of them were later transferred to Fort Snelling, a site with profound historical significance for Indigenous peoples.

Fort Snelling served as an internment camp during the winter of 1862–63 after the U.S.-Dakota Wars, when approximately 1,700 Dakota elders, women, and children were forcibly confined there. Historians estimate that between 100 and 300 Dakota people died at the site due to starvation, disease, and exposure.

The footage, which surfaced publicly in late January 2026, depicts the aircraft flying straight and level before a sudden flash and shower of sparks indicate the impact. Within seconds, an external fuel tank detaches, the fuselage tears open exposing the landing gear, and the plane begins to cartwheel violently. The cockpit and forward fuselage separate while burning fiercely, and the wing-mounted camera continues recording until the aircraft wreckage hits the ground, producing a large column of black smoke. The entire sequence lasts less than 20 seconds, leaving virtually no time for the pilot to eject.

Rather than concentrating on complex objects or detailed scenes, Tihomirow’s practice revolves around manipulating light itself. Using simple geometric forms combined with reflective, glass-like, and glossy surfaces, he creates striking visual effects that feel both abstract and strangely familiar. Color in these works is not applied as texture or paint; instead, it emerges naturally from the way light bends, scatters, and reflects across surfaces.

According to Trump, lowering housing prices would unfairly benefit people who, in his words, 'didn't work very hard,' while harming those who have built wealth through homeownership. He framed homeownership as a source of pride and financial security, saying his administration intends to preserve that sense of stability for people who already own homes.

At the same time, Trump attempted to balance this position by reiterating his desire to make buying a home easier through lower interest rates. He said his administration would work to reduce mortgage rates and monthly payments, presenting this as a way to help buyers without decreasing overall housing prices. This stance, however, represents a notable shift from recent public statements in which Trump emphasized housing]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-signals-priority-on-protecting-home-values-over-broad-housing-affordability</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-signals-priority-on-protecting-home-values-over-broad-housing-affordability</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Western Seizures of Russian Shadow Fleet Tankers Escalate Sanctions Enforcement and Raise Risks of Naval Confrontation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article claims that Western powers, especially NATO members like France, the US, Germany, and the UK, are engaging in undeclared naval piracy to enforce sanctions on Russia amid the Ukraine conflict. It details recent incidents, including France's seizure of the tanker 'Grinch' (boarded in the Mediterranean with video evidence resembling riot police tactics), a prior French capture of a Russian tanker in December 2025, Germany's blockade of another in the North Sea, and US interceptions of seven tankers since January 2026, many linked to Russian oil via Venezuela. These actions target Russia's 'shadow fleet' of about 600 vessels, which handle roughly 70% of its oil exports using evasive tactics like flag changes and disabled transponders.

These elevated offers apply to the Delta SkyMiles Gold, Platinum, and Reserve American Express Cards and are available until April 1, 2026. Notably, while the bonus miles are comparable to the business cards, the required minimum spending thresholds are roughly 75% of what business cardholders must meet, making these offers more accessible to individual consumers.

The Delta SkyMiles Gold Card currently offers up to 90,000 miles through a two-tier spending structure, with no annual fee for the first year and a $150 fee thereafter. It is positioned as a solid entry-level option for Delta flyers, providing benefits such as priority boarding, a free checked bag, and a 15% discount when redeeming miles for Delta-operated award flights.

Both paid and award flights count towards qualification, and the program even allows retroactive credit for flights taken as far back as 2021. Once a member achieves the first 'High Five' milestone, they receive 12,000 bonus Flying Club points. Additionally, Red tier members earn 10% bonus points on subsequent paid flights. The program is designed to reward less frequent but loyal flyers, with one qualifying flight per calendar year.

On one hand, the United States maintains an extremely restrictive and complex immigration system that is nearly impossible to navigate for poor migrants, especially those forced to survive through precarious, informal employment. On the other hand, the U.S. economy depends heavily on this very same undocumented labor to sustain key sectors such as agriculture, domestic services, and low-skilled maintenance jobs, where local labor would be prohibitively expensive due to near full employment conditions.

Rather than legalizing and protecting this essential workforce, the author argues that successive governments have deliberately chosen to 'look the other way.' This approach benefits employers by maintaining a large pool of workers in a state of permanent vulnerability, which keeps wages low and labor compliant.

Once flush with cash, these companies are now borrowing massive amounts to fund artificial intelligence initiatives, building large-scale data centers, and purchasing costly electronic chips. The transition from agile software firms to heavy infrastructure-dependent corporations has made them increasingly reliant on lenders. Analysts warn that by 2030, half of the ten largest debtors in the U.S. could be these tech companies investing in vast server facilities. Financial institutions are observing growing concern as the gap between the companies’ debt and their returns widens. Morgan Stanley projects that tech firms will raise $400 billion in debt this year, up from $170 billion last year and $44 billion in 2024.

It begins with infants and toddlers, explaining that oral care should start even before teeth emerge by gently cleaning gums. Once the first tooth appears, parents are encouraged to use a soft toothbrush with a small amount of fluoride toothpaste and to schedule a child’s first dental visit by age one to establish positive habits early.

For children aged three to twelve, the guide stresses the importance of supervised brushing, proper flossing techniques, and regular dental checkups every six months. Preventive treatments such as fluoride applications and dental sealants are highlighted, along with the role of good nutrition and limiting sugary foods and drinks.

This option can significantly increase the value of everyday spending and welcome bonuses, especially for users who want to earn airline or hotel miles instead of simple cash back.

Capital One allows transfers between a cardholder’s own accounts, meaning cash back earned on cards like the Savor, SavorOne, or Spark Cash can be converted at a rate of $0.01 per dollar to one mile when moved to Venture, Venture X, or VentureOne cards. Since these miles can then be transferred to airline and hotel partners at consistent ratios, cardholders can effectively earn higher mileage rates in categories such as dining, groceries, and entertainment—sometimes without paying an annual fee.

Founded by Pablo Iglesias in 2014, the party quickly gained traction, winning seats in the European Parliament and disrupting Spain's entrenched two-party system. The author, Lilith Verstrynge, joined Podemos early as an adviser to its MEPs and later worked in the Spanish government under Iglesias. Initially motivated by idealism and a desire to enact tangible policy change, she witnessed both the excitement of grassroots mobilization and the challenges of governance. Podemos' strategy relied heavily on media presence and populist messaging, which helped achieve rapid political success but limited the party's long-term organizational capacity. Internal divisions, leadership changes, and the rise of the Sumar coalition contributed to Podemos’ diminishing influence.

Unlike photographic or radar-imaging spy satellites, Jumpseat spacecraft were dedicated to signals intelligence (SIGINT), intercepting Soviet radar emissions and microwave communications. For decades, almost all technical details about these satellites remained secret, until the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) recently declassified images and partial specifications of the program.

The Jumpseat satellites weighed around 700 kilograms and were placed in highly elliptical Molniya orbits, optimized to linger over the Northern Hemisphere. This orbital configuration allowed them to monitor Soviet early-warning radar systems and communication links for extended periods.

His attorney, Ali Elhorr, and family members emphasized that Maher had consistently complied with annual ICE check-ins and had never committed any crimes.

On January 18, 2025, Matvei Rumiantsev, a 22-year-old former MMA fighter from a wealthy Russian family, allegedly assaulted his girlfriend in her Canary Wharf apartment. During the call, Barron witnessed part of the attack and immediately contacted UK emergency services. Prosecutors stated that Rumiantsev’s actions were fueled by jealousy over the woman’s friendship with Barron. The assault reportedly involved physical violence, verbal abuse, and threats. Rumiantsev was found guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and perverting the course of justice, the latter related to a letter sent from prison attempting to retract the victim’s complaint. He was acquitted of other charges, including rape and intentional strangulation, and will be sentenced on March 27, 2026.

The Ministry of Defense announced investigations into two generals from the Central Military Commission and the General Staff, including Zhang Youxia, for alleged 'illegal activities.' The Central Military Commission, led by Xi Jinping, controls not only the army but also police and militia forces. Since Xi Jinping assumed leadership of the Communist Party in 2012, more than 200,000 military personnel, including over 110 generals, have been removed or disciplined. The current purge targets missile artillery units, the defense industry, and operational command departments.

The design challenges conventional ideas of sustainability, which often focus on recycling or disposable alternatives, by proposing an approach rooted in endurance. Columns is a minimalist bench that encourages reflection on the lifespan of objects in a culture obsessed with the new and temporary.

Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was killed by immigration agents while filming officers at a protest. Trump stated that he felt particularly bad about Good’s death because her parents were strong supporters of him, describing them as 'tremendous Trump people.' He suggested that Good may have been 'radicalized' despite her family's political leanings. The Trump administration initially framed both victims as threats, with officials labeling Pretti as a would-be domestic terrorist and claiming Good attempted to harm agents with her vehicle.

Prior to the conflict, Russia supplied 45% of the EU's gas at prices 30-50% below US liquefied natural gas. Sanctions drastically cut these imports, forcing reliance on pricier alternatives and contributing to a reported 9% loss in chemical production capacity, according to industry sources like CEFIC. Specific 2024 production declines included Germany (25%), the Netherlands (20%), the UK (12%), France (10%), and Spain (8%). The sector's heavy dependence on natural gas not only for energy but also as a raw material for key compounds like ammonia and methanol amplified the impact. Initial post-war price surges reached +833% for gas and +251% for electricity, with lingering elevated costs—European gas remains 345% more expensive than in the US, and industrial electricity up to four times higher—even after partial]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-chemical-industry-faces-significant-decline-due-to-high-energy-costs-and-reduced-russian-gas-imports</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-chemical-industry-faces-significant-decline-due-to-high-energy-costs-and-reduced-russian-gas-imports</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Severe winter storms and heavy snowfall cause at least ten deaths across Japan]]></title><description><![CDATA[Japan has been severely affected by an intense winter weather episode marked by heavy snowfall, repeated cold waves, and strong winds, resulting in at least ten fatalities across several regions.

Unlike conventional backyard telescopes, Hyperia is positioned as a bridge between consumer technology and institutional astronomy, combining large-scale physical presence with advanced digital automation.

Standing roughly six feet tall when deployed, the telescope features precision optics developed in collaboration with Canon, including a wide aperture, advanced lens coatings, and a large full-frame sensor. These components allow Hyperia to capture deep-sky objects with exceptional clarity, detail, and color depth, revealing stars, nebulae, and cosmic dust in a way that goes far beyond what the naked eye or entry-level telescopes can provide.

The earlier incident occurred when Pretti stopped his car to observe and protest ICE agents chasing a family; he began whistling and yelling, leading five agents to tackle him, with one leaning on his back and causing the injury. Medication records reviewed by CNN were consistent with treatment for a broken rib. Sources indicated federal agents were aware of Pretti's name, potentially from a DHS surveillance database collecting information on Minneapolis protesters, amid a broader immigration enforcement surge. This raises questions about recognition during the fatal encounter. Pretti's death was the second killing of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis that month, following Renée Nicole Good's shooting.

Photos and video from the event showed the muzzle of her rifle tilting toward the head and face of an agent standing to her left, an action known as 'muzzle sweep.' This violates a fundamental firearms safety rule: always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction and never point a gun at anything you do not intend to destroy. Wyoming firearms experts, including retired peace officer and trainer Frank Groth and NRA-certified instructor Vince Vanata, emphasized the importance of muzzle awareness and treating every firearm as if it is loaded. They noted that even if the weapon was likely unloaded for the photo op, the breach in protocol was concerning, as an accidental discharge could cause injury from muzzle blast or other hazards.

The incident occurred amid federal immigration enforcement operations in the area. According to the report, CBP personnel ordered two female civilians to move out of a roadway during enforcement actions; when they refused, an officer pushed them, prompting one woman to run to Pretti for help. Agents then attempted to move Pretti and the woman, deploying oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray when they did not comply. Efforts to take Pretti into custody led to resistance and a physical struggle. During the altercation, a Border Patrol Agent (BPA) shouted 'He's got a gun!' multiple times. Approximately five seconds later, one BPA fired his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP Officer (CBPO) fired his Glock 47 at Pretti.

The details of the conversation that triggered Fico's reaction were not disclosed. However, publicly, Fico praised the meeting on Facebook, highlighting discussions on Ukraine, U.S.-Slovakia relations, and the EU's challenges, and did not mention Greenland or other controversial topics raised by Trump earlier in January. Fico later denied POLITICO's report, calling it false, and reaffirmed his support for many of Trump's strategies.

Federal officials initially described it as defensive action against a perceived threat, but investigations revealed protocol issues, leading to agents being placed on leave and an ongoing review. Stephen Miller acknowledged potential deviations from procedure, and President Trump promised an honest investigation. Pretti's family described him as kind and generous, devastated by the loss.

Under the proposed Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA), foreign companies investing in key strategic sectors of the EU would be required to form partnerships with European firms. These joint ventures would include mandatory sharing of know-how, a limit of 49% on foreign ownership, and a requirement to source half of manufacturing within the EU. The policy aims to raise industrial production from 14.3% of EU gross added value in 2020 to at least 20% by 2030. Critics argue that the move contradicts Europe’s long-standing commitment to open markets and could face legal and political challenges, including resistance from member states such as Sweden.

Before departing the White House for a trip to Iowa on Tuesday, Trump spoke briefly with reporters about the incident and was asked to respond to public concern. He described the situation as very sad, stressing that he felt compassion for Pretti’s family and referring broadly to his affection for “all of our people.” 

When addressing the circumstances around the shooting, Trump emphasized that individuals “can’t have guns” and “can’t walk in with guns,” suggesting that carrying firearms into certain situations is unacceptable. His remarks prompted a reporter to challenge him by invoking the Second Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms in the United States. Rather than directly engaging with the constitutional question, Trump repeated his point that people cannot walk in with guns and that such actions are not permitted.

Glass announced his decision on January 27, stating on social media that after careful consideration, he felt compelled to pull the piece because the symphony portrays Abraham Lincoln and embodies values that are now in direct conflict with those of the Kennedy Center under its current leadership. This leadership change stems from President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution, including his appointment as chairman, board restructuring with allies, and the renaming of the venue to incorporate his name as the Trump-Kennedy Center in late 2025.

The 1986 International Court of Justice ruling against the U.S. in the Nicaragua case confirmed that interfering with peaceful maritime trade is illegal. The U.S. has circumvented international law through domestic legislation, such as the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and its later extensions, to impose unilateral sanctions without formal war declarations.

After a slowdown in the mid-2010s due to debt concerns and strategic reevaluation, China accelerated its activities, signing around 350 agreements worth over $210 billion—the highest annual total since the BRI began. Africa has become a primary focus, with a significant surge in investments and construction contracts. The strategy has shifted to productive sectors rather than broad infrastructure lending. Energy projects, including renewables like solar, wind, and hydro, as well as oil and gas, play a central role in addressing Africa's energy demands and strengthening Chinese market presence. Mining has also seen record commitments for extracting and processing strategic minerals vital for global tech and energy sectors.

The charges—simple battery, simple assault, battery, and criminal trespass—stem from an incident on February 24, 2024, at Club Elan in Georgia, where she was arrested after an altercation with staff. According to police reports obtained by multiple outlets, Aronow allegedly forced her way into a locked employee bathroom to change a tampon. Bartender Haleigh Cauley permitted brief access, but upon returning, Aronow reportedly removed and threw the used tampon at her. When security intervened to escort her out, she allegedly resisted, pulling hair from one bouncer's scalp and striking another in the genitals, as captured on surveillance video.

The author contends that Western governments, institutions, and media reproduce old imperial logics under new moral vocabularies, today framed around human rights, gender equality, and humanitarian discourse.

Poch emphasizes the ideological role of the entertainment industry, especially Hollywood and British cinema, in romanticizing colonial violence and transforming historical atrocities into heroic narratives. Films depicting imperial expansion in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are presented as cultural tools that normalize domination and obscure mass suffering, such as famines, forced labor, and racial hierarchies.

While attending school with celebrity peers, including Mary-Kate Olsen and her then-boyfriend Max Winkler (son of actor Henry Winkler), Pratt aspired to direct his own film but lacked funding. After Olsen and Winkler broke up, Pratt noticed a collection of personal photos of the couple on Winkler's bedroom wall, which he described as documenting 'young love' in various settings like European hotels and Hollywood parties. Claiming he was helping his friend with the 'healing process,' Pratt took the photos without explicit objection from Winkler. He then sold them to a photo agency for $50,000, using the money toward his film project.

Bilt 2.0 launched new credit cards, modified ways to earn rewards on housing payments like rent and mortgages, and added this new rewards currency called Bilt Cash. The discussion highlights how Bilt Cash is earned primarily through everyday spending on the new Bilt cards, often at rates like 4% back, but it comes with complexities. Key points include its expiration, notably on December 31 each year when unused Bilt Cash is lost (referred to as 'Bilt Cash Gets Trashed Day'), though some carryover may be allowed up to a limit like $100.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on Canadian imports if Canada signs a trade agreement with China. Trump criticized Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, suggesting that Canada should not serve as a gateway for Chinese goods entering the US. Trump warned that China would 'devour Canada,' claiming it could destroy its economy and way of life. The announcement follows Canada’s recent agreements with China on reciprocal tariffs and the import of 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles under preferential tariffs of 6.1%. These agreements mark a significant step in strengthening China-Canada relations, which have been tense since 2018 due to the Huawei executive's arrest in Canada and subsequent detention of Canadian citizens in China. Despite Trump's threats, much of Canada-US trade remains tariff-free under NAFTA.

The UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that protecting its land, airspace, and maritime borders is a top priority and that any use of its territory for offensive operations against another sovereign nation would be unacceptable. The UAE's refusal directly affects U.S. strategic and logistical planning, limiting potential positions for naval operations and supply routes.

The issue appears to primarily affect physical machines running Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 25H2. While Microsoft states that only a small number of reports have been received, the severity of the problem has raised concern, as impacted devices require recovery through the Windows Recovery Environment and the removal of the latest security update to restore functionality.

This design ensures long-term power for over 30 years and allows safe launch in a shutdown state to prevent radioactive release in accidents. Each probe has a maximum mass of 8.2 tons, enabling launch aboard Long March 5 rockets, making this the second dual Long March 5 mission after Tianwen-3. The probe targeting the heliosheath's tail will launch in April 2032, perform a Jupiter flyby, and reach the tail region in 2059 at 130 AU (about 19.5 billion kilometers).

Driving a car offers maximum flexibility and allows travelers to explore remote areas at their own pace, though it can be slow and tiring. Air travel is the fastest option, especially for covering long distances like Sydney to Perth, but it can be costly and offers less freedom to explore remote regions. Coaches, such as Greyhound buses, are the most economical choice and can be convenient for overnight travel, but they are slower and less comfortable.

The drop comes in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. Videos of the incident and subsequent public scrutiny have undermined claims from Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, who accused Pretti of being a 'domestic terrorist' and attempting to kill federal agents.

While the standard publicly available offer provides 75,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points after spending $5,000 within the first three months of card membership, some Chase customers are reportedly seeing an enhanced version of this deal. This targeted offer includes the same 75,000-point bonus along with an additional $150 Chase Travel℠ credit.

The information was initially shared by a member of the Frequent Miler Insiders Facebook group, though the original post was later removed. As a result, some uncertainty remains around the exact terms of the $150 credit. The article notes that it is unclear whether the credit requires a minimum spend, is restricted to certain types of bookings such as hotels, or applies broadly to any purchase made through the Chase Travel portal.

On January 11, she and her friend followed ICE agents briefly, sounding alarms to protect others—a legally protected right. The agents responded by pepper-spraying their car, breaking the windows, and detaining them without cause. During her detention, O'Keefe witnessed disturbing conditions, including crowded cells, denied access to basic rights like phone calls and water, and the presence of families and children. She also describes verbal harassment and demeaning comments by agents. After eight hours, she was released without charges.

However, a small number of members who purchased points on December 31, 2025, initially saw their Diamond status incorrectly extended to December 31, 2027, effectively granting two years of elite status instead of one. IHG has since corrected this error, updating affected members' expiration dates to reflect the intended end of 2026. This issue appears to be limited to those who bought points on that specific date. While the initial extension would have been an unexpected bonus, the corrected expiration still provides the expected benefits of IHG Diamond status through 2026.

The author highlights examples such as the Iraq war, the Syrian civil conflict fueled by Operation Timber Sycamore, the repeated Israeli interventions in Lebanon, the Libyan civil war after NATO intervention, and regional destabilization in Somalia and Sudan.

The court hearing did not focus on the alleged assault itself, but rather on a dispute over who should lead the investigation into the leak of the video footage.

For over a thousand years, it operated as an autonomous monastic republic with its own laws, recognized historically by Byzantine emperors, Ottoman sultans, Greek kings, and even the European Union. A rule called 'avaton', established in 1046, prohibited the entry of women to preserve the monks’ spiritual focus. Female animals were also banned to prevent distractions, although some, like cats and hens, were allowed for practical reasons. Interestingly, Catalans were historically banned due to a violent conflict in 1305 known as the 'Catalan Revenge'. Following the assassination of Roger de Flor and the massacre of Catalan mercenaries, the survivors retaliated brutally against the Byzantine Empire, including looting monasteries on Mount Athos. As a result, Catalans were collectively prohibited from entering the peninsula for centuries.

By manually breaking down ice, the surface area increases, which not only improves the drink's texture but also its flavor and social appeal.

Originally, the Gemini program was a NASA initiative, conceived as Mercury Mark II, to develop orbital docking and extravehicular activities before the Apollo missions. While NASA considered Gemini as a preparatory step toward Apollo, the military saw it as an opportunity to explore space operations for potential orbital stations. In 1962, the Blue Gemini program was launched to support MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), a planned military space station, which later evolved into the MOL (Manned Orbital Laboratory) featuring reconnaissance capabilities including the KH-10 DORIAN telescope. The program planned multiple missions, initially including both NASA and Air Force astronauts, with tasks such as docking with Agena targets, testing the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit, reconnaissance, and deployment of equipment.

X+Living’s design emphasizes red brick, using it as the core material for the facade, spiral staircase, book 'rooms,' arches, and circulation elements. Approximately 400,000 custom bricks were hand-cut to create a seamless and immersive experience that feels rooted in the neighborhood while maintaining a futuristic, almost science-fiction aesthetic. In the central space, dark blue steel elements contrast with the brick, inspired by blinds to open sightlines and prevent the masonry from feeling too heavy. Furniture such as shelving, benches, and seating is built as an extension of the architecture, ensuring cohesive visual continuity and avoiding typical retail clutter. The design balances large open spaces with smaller reading nooks, promoting both exploration and quiet reflection.

TravelBank functions like a stored-value account that allows customers to use funds for United flight bookings, and historically, these funds have a five-year validity period. Users who added money to their accounts have noticed the 1-year expiration reflected in their accounts, though the official terms and conditions still state a five-year expiration. United customer support reportedly confirms that this is a likely glitch, and the issue is expected to be corrected in the near future.

Johnson, 44, allegedly abused a victim over several months beginning in 2024 in Hernando County. Court filings indicate that he attempted to silence the victim by offering a financial payout and referencing his Trump pardon, claiming he would include the victim in his will. Previously, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges related to the Capitol riot, including breaking into a Senate meeting room and menacing police, and was sentenced to one year in prison in August 2024, a sentence later wiped out by the pardon. He was arrested in July 2025 and remains in custody ahead of his trial scheduled for February 9, 2026. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

Through her work with the group Palestine on Trial, Gari estimates that since October 2023 there have been around 11,000 trials connected to pro-Palestinian protests. She reports that these judicial processes aim to demoralize and financially exhaust activists, forcing many to abandon their movements due to stress, legal costs, and fear of criminal records that can jeopardize visas, scholarships, or jobs. According to Gari, accusations of 'assaulting police' frequently target those who were in fact victims of police violence, while acts such as chanting banned slogans, wearing Palestinian symbols, or even defending oneself during arrests are treated as criminal offenses. She notes that expressions like “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” are now considered terrorist propaganda, and that universities]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/roser-gari-denounces-the-political-repression-of-pro-palestinian-activism-in-germany</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/roser-gari-denounces-the-political-repression-of-pro-palestinian-activism-in-germany</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Role of OS Maps in Effective Planning and Development Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Accurate geographic information is essential for successful planning and development projects.

These maps allow professionals to visualize constraints, assess feasibility, and comply with regulations, reducing costly errors and rework. They also facilitate stakeholder collaboration by offering a common visual reference for engineers, surveyors, and architects, which minimizes misunderstandings. Mapping data supports evidence-based decisions, helps navigate planning regulations, and identifies environmental considerations such as watercourses, drainage, biodiversity, and elevation. Beyond initial planning, OS maps aid in long-term project management, utility coordination, and adaptation to changing project needs, ensuring developments remain practical and sustainable.

Rutte stated bluntly that anyone believing the European Union or Europe as a whole can manage its defense independently is 'dreaming.' His remarks come shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump lifted tariffs on the EU and reached preliminary agreements with NATO regarding Greenland. Rutte explained that two workstreams were agreed upon with the U.S. to address tensions and strategic concerns in Greenland. The first involves NATO taking a larger role in Arctic defense to collectively counter the influence of Russia and China. The second workstream is a trilateral discussion between the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland, which NATO will not be part of.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la mañana del sábado 31 de enero y han generado una fuerte reacción social en una ciudad especialmente sensible a las cuestiones de convivencia y diversidad cultural.

Según el testimonio difundido públicamente en nombre del agente afectado, el guardia civil se encontraba desayunando con su familia cuando varios policías nacionales, sentados en una mesa cercana, comenzaron a proferir insultos en voz alta. Entre las expresiones denunciadas figuran calificativos racistas y deshumanizantes como 'mono' y 'chimpancé', además de una amenaza explícita de agresión física.

El llamado “Great Healthcare Plan” se reduce a un PDF de apenas dos páginas y carece de medidas concretas capaces de abordar los problemas estructurales de la sanidad estadounidense, un sector que consume cerca del 17% del PIB. Según el autor, el plan se limita a reciclar ideas clásicas del ideario republicano que ya han demostrado ser ineficaces o impopulares.

La propuesta se apoya en tres pilares principales. El primero es la reducción del precio de los medicamentos mediante la figura de la “nación más favorecida”, una fórmula que pretende igualar los precios estadounidenses a los de otros países. El problema es que el Estado federal no compra directamente los fármacos y el sistema está plagado de intermediarios privados, por lo que la medida resulta inaplicable sin una reforma profunda del merc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más de un centenar de mujeres andaluzas reclaman indemnización tras fallos en los cribados de cáncer de mama]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 101 mujeres han presentado reclamaciones patrimoniales ante el Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS) tras desarrollar cáncer de mama debido a fallos en los cribados sanitarios de Andalucía.

La asociación Amama cifra en hasta 338 el número de mujeres afectadas, incluyendo una víctima que ha fallecido. El origen del problema está vinculado a la externalización del servicio y la informatización del sistema, que sustituyó el seguimiento manual y la comunicación directa con las pacientes.

Uno de los datos más alarmantes es la situación de la infancia: uno de cada tres menores vive en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social, y más de dos millones de niños crecen en entornos sin las condiciones mínimas para su desarrollo.

En el país nórdico, un camarero puede percibir alrededor de 3.000 euros netos mensuales, a lo que se suman horas extraordinarias pagadas de forma obligatoria y, en muchos casos, la comida incluida durante la jornada laboral.

Sáez destaca que la jornada semanal estándar en Noruega es de 37,5 horas, inferior a las habituales en España, y que existe un respeto real por los descansos y la conciliación entre vida personal y profesional.

Lo que empezó como algo puntual terminó convirtiéndose en una adicción diaria que llegó a alcanzar un vaper al día, equivalente a unas 700 caladas o a fumar alrededor de 35 cigarrillos.

Con el paso del tiempo, Daniel empezó a notar graves problemas respiratorios: dificultad para respirar al hacer ejercicio, episodios nocturnos de asfixia y una sensación constante de falta de aire, incluso en reposo.

Este fenómeno implica un aumento abrupto de las temperaturas en la estratosfera, alterando los patrones climáticos habituales en Europa, Norteamérica y Asia. El vórtice polar actúa normalmente como una barrera que mantiene el aire frío en el Ártico, y su colapso puede debilitar el Jet Stream, permitiendo que el aire polar se desplace hacia el sur y el aire cálido ascienda hacia el norte. Existen dos formas de colapso: desplazamiento, que provoca frío localizado, y división, que puede generar olas de frío generalizadas, como ocurrió en 2018 con la conocida “Bestia del Este”.

El autor subraya que ya no se trata de debates sobre el mal gusto, la sensibilidad o la crítica legítima a un chiste o a un discurso, sino de una estrategia deliberada de intimidación. Amenazas como llamamientos al asesinato o a agresiones directas cruzan una línea peligrosa que afecta a la libertad de expresión y a la seguridad personal. Este tipo de violencia no puede justificarse bajo el argumento de la ofensa, ya que el humor, por definición, es contextual, mutable y sujeto a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-de-las-amenazas-para-silenciar-la-expresion-publica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-de-las-amenazas-para-silenciar-la-expresion-publica</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Red Política de Valores reúne en Bruselas a dirigentes y organizaciones de la ultraderecha internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La ultraderecha internacional prepara una nueva demostración de fuerza política e ideológica en el corazón de las instituciones europeas. El próximo 3 de febrero, el Parlamento Europeo acogerá en Bruselas la séptima edición de la Cumbre Transatlántica de la Red Política de Valores (PNfV), una organización que actúa como plataforma de coordinación entre líderes políticos, organizaciones civiles y referentes religiosos de una veintena de países. Tras haberse celebrado anteriormente en el Senado español, el encuentro consolida a España como uno de los nodos clave de esta red global.

Entre los participantes figuran el líder de Vox, Santiago Abascal, y la presidenta de Abogados Cristianos, Polonia Castellanos, junto a representantes de think tanks vinculados al trumpismo y a movimientos ultraconservadores de América y Europa.

En los tres años de legislatura, Feijóo ha interrogado en 39 ocasiones al presidente Pedro Sánchez sin dedicar ni una sola pregunta de forma central al estado del sistema ferroviario en España.

Según el estudio realizado por Público, las referencias a los trenes han sido escasas y siempre secundarias. En total, solo aparecen cuatro menciones tangenciales al ferrocarril, realizadas en 2025, y siempre integradas dentro de críticas más amplias sobre impuestos, gestión económica o funcionamiento general del Estado. En ningún caso el transporte ferroviario fue el eje principal de sus intervenciones.

Este dato contrasta con la dureza del discurso del líder del PP tras los recientes accidentes ferroviarios, en los que han fallecido varias personas.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la tarde del 31 de enero en el parque de Josep Serra Martí, una zona frecuentada por vecinos y jóvenes del barrio.

Según la información confirmada por fuentes cercanas a la investigación, los agresores se aproximaron a las víctimas con la intención de sustraerles los patinetes eléctricos que utilizaban. Durante el asalto, emplearon machetes para intimidar y agredir a los menores, provocándoles heridas de consideración. Ambos jóvenes tuvieron que ser trasladados a un centro hospitalario para recibir atención médica urgente. Uno de ellos ya ha recibido el alta hospitalaria, aunque necesitó hasta 15 grapas en la espalda a consecuencia de las lesiones sufridas.

Sin embargo, la planificación del transporte público, especialmente del Metro, está generando una clara desigualdad entre los nuevos barrios del norte y los del sur y sureste de la capital. Mientras desarrollos como Valdebebas o Madrid Nuevo Norte acumulan entre tres y cinco estaciones proyectadas, otros barrios recientes como El Cañaveral siguen sin una estación propia y dependen de conexiones más lejanas o de autobuses.

Valdebebas, con unos 30.000 habitantes y grandes equipamientos como la Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid o el hospital Zendal, contará con varias paradas y una conexión directa con el aeropuerto. En contraste, El Cañaveral, con una población similar, vio descartada su estación de Metro por problemas geotécnicos del terreno, según la Comunidad de Madrid.

El documento, elaborado como trámite previo obligatorio para autorizar el gasto, señala que el acuerdo tendrá repercusiones no solo en el Servicio Cántabro de Salud, sino en todo el sector público autonómico durante al menos 16 años, con posibilidad de prórroga hasta alcanzar dos décadas.

El informe, firmado por el jefe de Servicio de Gestión Presupuestaria, subraya que el volumen de gasto comprometido obligará a adoptar medidas de priorización del gasto público en futuros ejercicios. En concreto, el convenio prevé un desembolso total de 216 millones de euros, cifra que posteriormente fue incrementada en otros 40 millones una vez aprobado definitivamente el acuerdo.

La decisión, publicada en el Diario Oficial de la UE y con efecto retroactivo desde octubre de 2025, equipara estos productos a los de origen marroquí y elimina la obligación de etiquetarlos como procedentes de un territorio ocupado.

Esta medida ha generado un fuerte rechazo entre agricultores y pescadores españoles, que denuncian una situación de competencia desleal. Organizaciones como Asaja y FEPEX alertan de que tomates cherry, melones, pescado congelado y pulpo procedentes de la región de Dakhla entran en la UE con menores costes laborales, sociales y ambientales, presionando los precios y reduciendo la rentabilidad de las explotaciones nacionales.

A partir de una anécdota histórica del rey godo Teodorico, que castigó la falta de principios de un ministro incapaz de ser fiel ni a su dios, la autora traza un paralelismo con reinas y consortes contemporáneas que renunciaron a sus creencias por conveniencia política y matrimonial.

Concostrina analiza varios casos: desde Charlene de Mónaco y su conversión al catolicismo, pasando por Mary de Dinamarca y otras consortes que cambiaron de confesión como trámite administrativo, hasta el ejemplo español, donde la religión fue durante décadas un requisito político de primer orden.

Se trata de pilares en forma de 'T' datados en torno a 11.000 años de antigüedad, muy similares a los característicos del sitio de Göbekli Tepe.

Göbekli Tepe, reconocido como Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO desde 2018 y datado hacia el 9600 a.C., es considerado el templo más antiguo conocido.

Aunque en los medios se presentan como casos aislados —por ejemplo, empleados despedidos por comerse un producto destinado a la basura—, el texto sostiene que estas situaciones son solo la excusa final de una estrategia planificada.

Según el artículo, las empresas esperan a que el trabajador cometa una falta menor o fabrican acusaciones de bajo rendimiento para justificar un despido disciplinario inmediato, sin preaviso ni indemnización. Si el trabajador no demanda, la empresa consigue un despido gratuito. Si demanda, la empresa alarga el proceso evitando la conciliación administrativa y espera al juzgado, donde suele ofrecer acuerdos muy por debajo de la indemnización legal, aprovechand]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-las-empresas-utilizan-el-despido-disciplinario-para-abaratar-indemnizaciones-y-forzar-acuerdos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-las-empresas-utilizan-el-despido-disciplinario-para-abaratar-indemnizaciones-y-forzar-acuerdos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El autor de la carta crítica a Sánchez por Adamuz recibió contratos sanitarios de la Junta por más de 800.000 euros]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza el perfil real de Fidel Sáenz de la Torre, presentado inicialmente en algunos medios como un ciudadano anónimo que escribió una dura carta al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, tras el accidente ferroviario de Adamuz que causó 46 fallecidos.

Sin embargo, El Plural revela que Sáenz de la Torre no es un ciudadano ajeno a la administración pública, sino un empresario con importantes vínculos contractuales con la Junta de Andalucía.

La orden instruye al Departamento de Policía de Chicago (CPD) a actuar cuando observe o reciba denuncias de conductas ilegales por parte de agentes de ICE o CBP que vulneren la legislación estatal o local.

El diputado autonómico Xabel Vegas califica esta postura como 'populismo pesquero' y la considera irresponsable desde el punto de vista ambiental, al ignorar la evidencia científica sobre el grave declive de la anguila europea.

Según recuerda la formación, el Consejo Internacional para la Exploración del Mar (CIEM) lleva años recomendando capturas cero debido al colapso de la especie. En este contexto, Sumar defiende no solo la prohibición total de la pesca de la angula, sino también de su comercialización y consumo.

Además, incluía un enlace oficial para que las personas migrantes gestionaran su propia salida del país.

La publicación fue recibida con indignación inmediata por parte de expertos en inmigración, periodistas, activistas y responsables políticos, que la interpretaron como una incitación directa a delatar a vecinos y como una normalización de prácticas autoritarias.

Según Pappé, el Estado israelí no puede considerarse una democracia, ya que mantiene un sistema de apartheid que niega derechos civiles y humanos a la población palestina desde 1948 y, especialmente, desde la ocupación iniciada en 1967. Para el historiador, la imagen democrática de Israel es una construcción ideológica que no resiste un análisis riguroso.

Pappé describe una profunda fractura interna entre dos proyectos de país: el denominado “Estado de Judea”, representado por la extrema derecha religiosa y nacionalista aliada a Netanyahu, y el “Estado de Israel”, vinculado a sectores laicos y liberales.

A través de ejemplos concretos como Mammee Bay o Roaring River, el reportaje muestra cómo terrenos costeros han sido vendidos a promotores privados, en muchos casos extranjeros, para la construcción de resorts y complejos residenciales de lujo.

La candidata favorita, Laura Fernández, representante del oficialismo, lidera las encuestas con opciones reales de ganar en primera vuelta y obtener además mayoría parlamentaria. Su proyecto político se inspira abiertamente en el modelo de seguridad impulsado por el presidente salvadoreño Nayib Bukele, basado en la concentración de poder, el endurecimiento penal y el uso recurrente de estados de excepción.

El auge de este discurso se explica en gran medida por el incremento de la violencia vinculada al crimen organizado. Costa Rica se ha convertido en un país de tránsito clave para el narcotráfico y ha visto emerger organizaciones criminales de alcance internacional, lo que ha disparado los homicidios y la sensación de inseguridad. En este contexto, la promesa de “mano dura” y encarcelamiento masivo funciona c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/costa-rica-debate-un-giro-institucional-ante-el-avance-del-discurso-de-seguridad-inspirado-en-bukele</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/costa-rica-debate-un-giro-institucional-ante-el-avance-del-discurso-de-seguridad-inspirado-en-bukele</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identificados dos agentes federales por la muerte del enfermero Alex Pretti durante un operativo en Mineápolis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las autoridades estadounidenses han identificado a los dos agentes federales que dispararon y causaron la muerte de Alex Pretti, un enfermero de 37 años, durante un operativo de inmigración realizado el pasado 24 de enero en Mineápolis. Según ha revelado el medio de investigación ProPública, los agentes son Jesús Ochoa, miembro de la Patrulla Fronteriza, y Raymundo Gutiérrez, de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP), ambos destinados habitualmente en el sur de Texas. El caso ha generado una fuerte ola de indignación social y ha intensificado las protestas en diversas ciudades del país.

Pretti es la segunda persona que muere en Mineápolis en enero a manos de agentes federales, tras el fallecimiento de Renee Good el 7 de enero, lo que ha elevado la presión política y social sobre el Gobierno federal.

Tras los accidentes mortales en Adamuz (Córdoba) y Gelida (Barcelona) en enero de 2026, la capacidad de vigilancia de la red ha vuelto a estar en el centro del debate. La principal hipótesis sobre el accidente de Adamuz apunta a la rotura de una soldadura en el carril, lo que subraya la necesidad de revisiones periódicas y efectivas. Según el Ministerio de Transportes, España cuenta con nueve trenes auscultadores en servicio, tres de Renfe y seis de Adif, además de otros vehículos de empresas privadas. Sin embargo, el Sindicato Ferroviario considera que la flota actual es insuficiente, señalando que algunas líneas, como el núcleo de cercanías de Sevilla, llevan más de dos años sin auscultación.

Su enfoque atrevido y provocador la convirtió en un referente mediático y un símbolo de la libertad de prensa recién instaurada en España. La publicación destacó por entrevistar a figuras políticas y culturales, como Adolfo Suárez, y por cubrir escándalos y crímenes que marcaron época, incluyendo el asesinato de los marqueses de Urquijo y la documentación del linchamiento de dos cabos británicos por el IRA. Además, Interviú innovó en la representación de la mujer en los medios, publicando fotografías semidesnudas de celebridades que generaron debate sobre la sexualidad y los roles de género.

En una entrevista concedida en Andorra, país en el que reside actualmente, Mur admite que “muy probablemente” hubo negligencias en la gestión de la crisis sanitaria y vincula la falta de atención directa en las residencias a la escasez de profesionales disponibles en aquel momento.

Según sus explicaciones, durante los días más críticos de marzo de 2020 la atención primaria madrileña sufrió miles de bajas por contagios de covid-19, a lo que se sumó el cierre de 37 servicios de urgencias de atención primaria (SUAP).

Aunque el dólar sigue siendo moneda de reserva, la creciente desconfianza en la sostenibilidad de la deuda estadounidense impulsa a bancos centrales y gobiernos a reforzar sus reservas en metales preciosos. Este fenómeno recuerda la decadencia de antiguas potencias, como Francia y Reino Unido tras el fiasco del Canal de Suez en 1956, y se refleja en la política exterior agresiva de Washington en múltiples frentes, desde Venezuela hasta Cuba. La globalización ha dado lugar a nuevas potencias económicas y tecnológicas, especialmente en Asia, mientras que los intentos de EEUU de mantener su dominio comercial y militar muestran signos de micromilitarismo internacional y de defensiva ante la pérdida de influencia.

En su mensaje, la usuaria insinuaba que, mientras AEMET aseguraba que no se estaba produciendo una situación meteorológica extrema, las imágenes del Niágara congelado demostraban lo contrario. Sin embargo, la publicación omitía un dato esencial: las cataratas del Niágara no se encuentran en territorio español, sino en la frontera entre Canadá y Estados Unidos, a miles de kilómetros de distancia y bajo condiciones climáticas completamente distintas.

La urbanización, levantada en las décadas de 1960 y 1970 sobre dunas y en una zona de alta erosión natural, ignoró la dinámica litoral y eliminó las barreras naturales que permitían a la playa regenerarse tras los temporales. Durante años, la anchura del arenal ocultó el riesgo, pero la pérdida progresiva de arena ha dejado viviendas, paseos marítimos y chiringuitos directamente expuestos al mar.

Las borrascas de 2026 no han creado el problema, sino que han acelerado un proceso anunciado desde hace décadas.

Entre esa fecha y algún momento de 1939, alrededor de quince mil personas pasaron por este recinto, convertido en un lugar de reclusión masiva, hacinamiento y represión, antes de ser trasladadas a cárceles, campos de trabajos forzados o directamente ejecutadas. Pese a la magnitud de los hechos, esta función represiva del coso fue sistemáticamente borrada de la memoria colectiva mediante su reconstrucción, la exaltación de la épica franquista y la ausencia de cualquier señalización oficial.

El artículo detalla cómo, tras los bombardeos sufridos durante la batalla de Gijón, las ruinas de la plaza reunían las condiciones idóneas para encerrar a miles de prisioneros: un amplio espacio cercado, bien comunicado y alejado del centro urbano, lo que permitía ocultar el espectáculo de la repre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-plaza-de-toros-de-el-bibio-y-su-uso-como-campo-de-concentracion-tras-la-caida-de-gijon-en-1937</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-plaza-de-toros-de-el-bibio-y-su-uso-como-campo-de-concentracion-tras-la-caida-de-gijon-en-1937</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 23:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La princesa Mette-Marit se ve implicada en documentos que muestran su relación con Jeffrey Epstein]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Casa Real noruega enfrenta una nueva polémica tras la desclasificación de documentos del caso Epstein, que revelan una relación más estrecha y prolongada de lo previamente admitido entre la princesa Mette-Marit y el empresario condenado.

El reportaje se centra en los llamados “long stayers”, personas que llevan al menos tres años en prisión preventiva, algunos incluso más de una década, pese a que la Constitución de Estados Unidos y la legislación de California garantizan el derecho a un juicio rápido.

A través de casos concretos como los de Vincent Bell, Montrail Brackens y Marquez Harrison, el artículo muestra cómo los retrasos se acumulan por continuas prórrogas, falta de jueces, agendas saturadas, escasez de recursos y una dinámica institucional que normaliza aplazar juicios indefinidamente. Aunque los acusados han invocado repetidamente su derecho a un juicio rápido, los tribunales suelen aceptar las solicitudes de aplazamiento de la fiscalía, incluso cuando los retrasos se prolongan durante años.

Abdolah murió lejos de su tierra, y su madre describe su muerte no desde el consuelo religioso, sino como el final del dolor. La autora reflexiona sobre cómo, para muchas madres en contextos de violencia extrema, la muerte llega a percibirse como una forma de descanso ante la imposibilidad de proteger a sus hijos.

El relato se desplaza después a los hermanos de Abdolah, ya en Madrid, mostrando cómo el trauma no se limita a la pérdida o a la enfermedad, sino que se infiltra en gestos cotidianos.

En animales como roedores o lobos, se ha observado que la presencia del parásito modifica comportamientos: por ejemplo, en ratones reduce el miedo a los gatos, facilitando así la transmisión del parásito a su hospedador definitivo. Estudios científicos sugieren que en humanos la infección podría estar relacionada con cambios sutiles en la personalidad, tendencia a comportamientos de riesgo o variaciones en neurotransmisores como la dopamina y hormonas como la testosterona. La comunidad científica todavía debate el impacto real de estos efectos, y se necesitan más investigaciones para entender si estas alteraciones son estadísticamente relevantes o simplemente correlacio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-parasito-toxoplasma-gondii-esta-muy-extendido-y-puede-influir-en-el-comportamiento-humano</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-parasito-toxoplasma-gondii-esta-muy-extendido-y-puede-influir-en-el-comportamiento-humano</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno promete revalorizar las pensiones tras el rechazo del decreto y busca apoyos para un nuevo texto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha reafirmado su compromiso de revalorizar las pensiones conforme al IPC tras el rechazo en el Congreso del decreto ley conocido como ‘escudo social’, que fue tumbado por los votos en contra de PP, Vox y Junts. Durante un acto de campaña en Teruel con motivo de las elecciones autonómicas en Aragón, Sánchez aseguró que la subida de las pensiones se hará “sí o sí, con o sin el Partido Popular”, subrayando que esta política se ha mantenido de forma continuada durante los siete años de su mandato.

El decreto rechazado incluía, además de la revalorización de las pensiones, medidas como la limitación de desahucios para personas en situación de vulnerabilidad, el bono social eléctrico, el aumento del Ingreso Mínimo Vital y ayudas extraordinarias a ayuntamientos afectados por la DANA en Valencia.

El foco se centra en Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, y Fernando Camino, presidente de Quirón Prevención. Según los detalles, Camino vendió a su esposa el 20% de una empresa por 4.000 euros, y meses después, González Amador adquirió esa misma participación por medio millón de euros. Este movimiento forma parte de un esquema que habría generado casi 2 millones de euros en beneficios para González Amador a través de contratos favorecidos por empresas relacionadas con Quirón.

En términos absolutos, Cataluña es la comunidad con el mayor presupuesto asignado y la segunda con mayor volumen total de inversión ejecutada, con cerca de 2.852 millones de euros invertidos de los más de 7.500 millones previstos.

A partir de un caso concreto en Minneapolis, donde un agente roció con spray de pimienta a un manifestante ya reducido, el artículo describe cómo un colectivo antifascista identificó rápidamente al agente y difundió su identidad mediante carteles y redes sociales.

El texto explica que esta práctica, conocida como “doxing” en el lenguaje común, es presentada por estos grupos como una forma de rendición de cuentas comunitaria frente a la violencia del Estado, no como un intento de incitar al acoso.

Una vez en el domicilio, fingía salir a buscar una botella de vino y, al abrir la puerta, otros dos hombres encapuchados accedían al interior.

El autor la sitúa dentro de la sección 'Canciones con historia', dedicada a rescatar composiciones clave en la evolución de la canción de autor, subrayando la enorme influencia que Yupanqui ejerció sobre varias generaciones de cantautores, especialmente en las décadas de 1960 y 1970.

La canción es presentada como un referente artístico y ético que marcó a figuras como Carlos Cano, Aute, Silvio Rodríguez o Mikel Laboa. Este último relata cómo descubrió la obra de Yupanqui en 1955 a través de un disco recibido desde Burdeos y cómo «Preguntitas sobre Dios» le impactó por su sensibilidad y su carácter radicalmente crítico en un contexto social dominado por el silencio y el miedo.

Estos satélites, desarrollados por Hughes y basados en plataformas cilíndricas como las HS-308/HS-318, operaban en órbitas elípticas altamente excéntricas tipo Molniya, con apogeo sobre el hemisferio norte, lo que les permitía interceptar señales de radares de alerta temprana soviéticos y comunicaciones por microondas durante largos periodos sobre territorio enemigo.

A diferencia de los satélites COMINT como Canyon (órbita cuasigeoestacionaria) o Rhyolite/Aquacade (geoestacionaria), los Jumpseat combinaban capacidades de interceptación de señales desde una posición más cercana y dinámica.

Este hundimiento superaría incluso el duro batacazo sufrido en los comicios de 2024, cuando los tories registraron su mínimo histórico.

La crisis conservadora se explica por una cascada de deserciones de alto nivel. Diputados, exministros y grandes donantes han abandonado el partido en el último año para integrarse o apoyar a Reform.

Las piezas, pertenecientes a la realeza del antiguo reino polaco-lituano, fueron descubiertas tras una inspección endoscópica que permitió localizar una cavidad secreta tras una pared de la cripta. En su interior aparecieron coronas, cetros, anillos y medallones envueltos en un periódico fechado en septiembre de 1939, en los primeros días de la invasión nazi de Polonia.

El origen del ocultamiento se remonta a 1931, cuando una inundación dejó al descubierto varios sarcófagos reales en la catedral. Para preservar las insignias funerarias, los conservadores las retiraron y, ante el temor de saqueos y destrucción por el inminente conflicto bélico, decidieron esconderlas de manera urgente bajo el propio templo. Durante décadas, el paradero de estos objetos fue un misterio, alimenta]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hallan-en-la-catedral-de-vilna-joyas-funerarias-de-la-realeza-polaco-lituana-ocultadas-en-1939</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hallan-en-la-catedral-de-vilna-joyas-funerarias-de-la-realeza-polaco-lituana-ocultadas-en-1939</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 18:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galicia destaca como un reservorio hídrico excepcional en un contexto de aridez creciente en Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[Galicia ha sido identificada por estudios recientes como una de las regiones con mayor saturación hídrica del planeta en proporción a su superficie, una condición que contrasta con la creciente aridez que afecta a buena parte de Europa y del Mediterráneo. El hallazgo se apoya en datos obtenidos mediante satélites y sensores de humedad del suelo, que muestran una capacidad extraordinaria de retención de agua y una persistencia notable de acuíferos superficiales en el noroeste peninsular.

Este comportamiento no se explica únicamente por la frecuencia de las lluvias, sino por una combinación de factores físicos y climáticos: la interacción del relieve gallego con las masas de aire atlánticas, la estructura geológica de los suelos y la dinámica atmosférica asociada al Atlántico Norte. Gracias a ello, montes y valles mantienen ciclos biológicos activos incluso en periodos sin precipitaciones, algo cada vez menos común en otras regiones europeas sometidas a estrés hídrico.

El experto cubano Jorge Piñón, del Instituto de Energía de la Universidad de Texas, advierte que si en las próximas seis a ocho semanas no llega petróleo o combustibles desde proveedores como Venezuela, México o Rusia, el país podría sufrir apagones generalizados y paralización de sectores clave. La isla necesita aproximadamente 110.000 barriles diarios, de los cuales solo 40.000 provienen de su producción interna, lo que hace que dependa en gran medida de las importaciones. Históricamente, Venezuela fue el principal suministrador, pero su producción se ha desplomado, y otros proveedores como México y Rusia aportan cantidades insuficientes.

Lejos de ser una impresión subjetiva, diversos estudios científicos indican que los gatos domésticos han desarrollado estrategias concretas para influir en el comportamiento humano. No actúan solo por instinto, sino que observan, aprenden y ajustan su conducta según la persona con la que interactúan.

Investigaciones de la Universidad de Cornell muestran que los gatos utilizan distintos tipos de maullidos dependiendo del contexto y del interlocutor humano. A diferencia de lo que ocurre entre ellos, los gatos emplean la vocalización principalmente con las personas, afinando sonidos que generan respuestas concretas como atención o alimento. Los maullidos agudos o intermitentes, similares al llanto de un bebé, activan mecanismos automáticos en el cerebro humano, lo que aumenta su eficacia.

La ilusión inicial de Morente era notable, ya que siempre había defendido a Rosalía frente a las críticas por su aproximación al flamenco y la consideraba cercana a la familia Morente.

Según el Gobierno israelí, la exigencia de estas listas responde a motivos de seguridad y a la necesidad de evitar que la cobertura humanitaria sea utilizada para actividades hostiles o vinculadas al terrorismo. El ministro Amichai Chikli acusó a MSF de falta de transparencia y de actuar por intereses ajenos a la seguridad. Desde el ministerio aseguran que la información solicitada se usaría únicamente con fines administrativos internos y no sería compartida con terceros.

Rehmet, veterano militar y líder sindical, se presentó como una alternativa centrada en los derechos laborales, el apoyo a los veteranos y la defensa de servicios públicos básicos.

A través de la Nouvelle Droite, estos movimientos han ganado terreno en países como Italia, Estados Unidos y Rusia, utilizando la pobreza, la ansiedad y la rabia popular para ganar apoyo. El análisis aborda cómo estos movimientos están desmantelando progresivamente las democracias y los derechos humanos. Además, Delle Donne explica el rol de los tecnocapitalistas, la influencia de los grandes millonarios y cómo las ideas ultraderechistas han sido absorbidas incluso por sectores políticos que históricamente las rechazaban.

El PP ha intentado equiparar la responsabilidad política de Puente con la del expresident valenciano Carlos Mazón por la gestión de la DANA en Valencia, exigiendo su dimisión inmediata y recibiéndole en el Senado con gritos de 'dimisión'. Desde el programa 'La Hora de La 1' de TVE, la presentadora Silvia Intxaurrondo ha cuestionado esta estrategia, argumentando que las dos tragedias son incomparables y que el PP no 'cierra el círculo' en su razonamiento: si Puente debe dimitir por responsabilidad política aunque no tenga culpa directa, ¿por qué no se exigió lo mismo a Mazón durante un año, hasta que Alberto Núñez Feijóo reconoció ante la jueza no haber estado puntualmente informado?

Según la información publicada por EL ESPAÑOL, se asignaron más de 30.000 euros a personas cercanas al entorno de Podemos, incluyendo a miembros de la dirección autonómica y colaboradores en campañas políticas. Corrales considera que estos hechos son 'sumamente graves' y ha instado al partido a tomar medidas si fuese necesario.

La polémica gira en torno a la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público, que obliga a prevenir y evitar favoritismos y conflictos de interés en las licitaciones, así como al código ético de Podemos, que exige a sus responsables públicos respetar el deber de abstención.

El caso ha puesto el foco en el decreto aprobado por el Consell de Carlos Mazón el 10 de diciembre de 2024, que modificó de forma sustancial las condiciones de acceso a este tipo de viviendas. La nueva normativa elevó el límite de renta de 46.800 a 54.600 euros anuales, con posibilidad de alcanzar hasta los 66.360 euros si se cumplían determinados requisitos, así como el precio máximo del metro cuadrado, que pasó a 2.400 euros.

Gracias a estos cambios, perfiles con ingresos elevados, como una concejala de Urbanismo con un sueldo cercano a los 59.000 euros anuales, pudieron acceder a viviendas protegidas con precios muy por debajo del mercado.

El artista se encontraba ingresado desde hacía un par de días en el Hospital Universitario La Fe, centro en el que ya había sido tratado anteriormente por problemas respiratorios. Su muerte pone fin a la trayectoria de una de las figuras más reconocibles del humor popular español de las décadas de los setenta y ochenta.

Nacido en Zaragoza el 14 de enero de 1945, Fernando Esteso Allué creció en el seno de una familia vinculada a la jota, lo que marcó desde muy temprano su vocación artística. Con apenas seis años debutó sobre los escenarios como “El Niño de la Jota” y, a partir de ahí, se formó en el teatro de variedades y la revista, un entorno que le permitió desarrollar una notable versatilidad como cantante, actor y humorista. Esa base escénica sería clave para su posterior éxito en cine y televisión.

La decisión se produce en un contexto de fuerte tensión social y política por las redadas migratorias impulsadas por el Gobierno federal en el estado de Minesota, que han sido rechazadas por autoridades locales y han provocado movilizaciones masivas en las últimas semanas.

Según explicó el propio Trump a través de la red social Truth, las fuerzas federales no intervendrán en manifestaciones ni disturbios salvo que los gobiernos estatales o municipales soliciten expresamente su ayuda. Con esta orden, el Ejecutivo traslada la responsabilidad principal del mantenimiento del orden público a las autoridades locales y estatales, aunque mantiene el despliegue federal para la protección de edificios e instalaciones del Gobierno central.

Su análisis se apoya en el fuerte aumento del precio del oro y la plata, que interpreta como una señal de desconfianza global hacia el dólar y de un repunte inflacionario más profundo de lo que reflejan las cifras oficiales.

Schiff sostiene que los bancos centrales están incrementando sus reservas de oro y reduciendo su exposición al dólar y a los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, lo que, a su juicio, anticipa una crisis de deuda soberana y un debilitamiento del estatus del dólar como moneda de reserva mundial. En su intervención, afirma que la economía de Estados Unidos depende en exceso del consumo y del crédito, así como de la financiación externa, y que este modelo se vuelve insostenible si el resto del mundo deja de respaldar al dólar.

Este tipo de escritura, conocida también como 'blackletter', se asoció con los movimientos nacionalistas de la derecha, a pesar de su origen medieval y su adopción por diversas culturas de Europa. La lucha entre los estilos de escritura gótica y romana refleja la tensión entre la modernidad y el pasado, y cómo los nazis utilizaron esta caligrafía para promover su ideología de pureza germánica.

En su análisis, Han explica que la vorágine diaria, las obligaciones y la obsesión por el rendimiento personal generan un desgaste silencioso de los vínculos. Según su perspectiva, no es culpa de nadie que ciertas amistades se apaguen; simplemente el sistema nos vuelve invisibles para los demás, reduciendo el tiempo y la atención que podemos dedicar al otro.

En sus memorias, relató que vino a Estados Unidos atraído por la idea de una gran libertad. Sin embargo, con el paso de los años, reconoció que su visión era errónea. Esta crítica a las expectativas que tenía sobre la libertad en el país se convirtió en una reflexión amarga al final de su vida. Einstein, que llegó a ver a Estados Unidos como una tierra prometida, finalmente llegó a la conclusión de que las realidades sociales y políticas del país no coincidían con sus ideales. A lo largo de su vida, este desencanto con el sistema estadounidense se fue profundizando. La reflexión de Einstein invita a cuestionar las percepciones sobre las libertades y los valores que se dan por sentados en las sociedades occidentales, y nos hace pensar en las contradicciones inherentes a los ideales de libertad que muchos países promueven.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albert-einstein-reflexiona-sobre-su-vision-equivocada-de-la-libertad-en-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albert-einstein-reflexiona-sobre-su-vision-equivocada-de-la-libertad-en-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez sigue impune mientras concentra poder en la Comunidad de Madrid]]></title><description><![CDATA[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, jefe de gabinete de la presidenta Isabel Díaz Ayuso, mantiene su poder en la Comunidad de Madrid pese a múltiples controversias.

Este descenso se debe a la aceleración del empleo privado y la desaceleración del empleo público. Desde 2019, la ocupación en el sector público ha aumentado un 10,1%, frente al 12,8% del sector privado. A pesar de las convocatorias récord para el empleo público, el número de trabajadores en este sector ha disminuido en 2025, debido a que muchas de estas ofertas son de sustitución. A nivel regional, Madrid ha registrado una reducción en el empleo público, mientras que en otras comunidades como Extremadura el empleo público sigue siendo fundamental para la economía local.

Ambos fueron detenidos en la puerta de su vivienda en un suburbio de Minneapolis y trasladados a más de 2.000 kilómetros de distancia, donde han permanecido retenidos durante más de una semana mientras avanzaba su caso migratorio.

En una resolución especialmente dura, el juez Fred Biery criticó con severidad la actuación del Gobierno estadounidense, al que acusó de aplicar de forma incompetente políticas migratorias basadas en cuotas de deportación, incluso cuando ello implica causar daño psicológico a menores. El magistrado recurrió a referencias históricas como la Declaración de Independencia y las advertencias de los padres fundadores para denunciar lo que considera un comportamiento autoritario y contrario al Estado de derecho.

Zajárova subrayó que, a juicio de Rusia, el ataque contra una infraestructura energética estratégica de esta magnitud solo pudo llevarse a cabo con capacidades técnicas, logísticas y de inteligencia que van más allá de un grupo reducido o de un único país. En este sentido, reiteró que Moscú no descarta la implicación de otros Estados o actores internacionales y exigió que todas las hipótesis sean analizadas sin exclusiones políticas previas.

La inflamación provocada por la periodontitis podría ser un factor clave, ya que las bacterias de la boca pueden entrar en el torrente sanguíneo y favorecer la acumulación de grasa en las arterias, lo que incrementa las probabilidades de sufrir infartos o ictus.

Analistas como Yamila Pino y Roger Senserrich destacan 'grises legales' en las políticas de Trump, incluyendo entradas en domicilios con órdenes administrativas (cuestionadas por violar la Cuarta Enmienda), reducción de formación de agentes, duplicación de efectivos hasta 22.000 y reclutamiento masivo.

Por un lado, el país mantiene una legislación de inmigración extremadamente restrictiva que dificulta la regularización de los inmigrantes pobres; por otro, su economía depende de forma esencial de esa misma mano de obra barata para sostener sectores clave como la agricultura, los servicios domésticos o el mantenimiento básico. La solución racional —facilitar la regularización— es descartada deliberadamente, optándose en su lugar por una tolerancia informal que permite disponer de trabajadores en situación de vulnerabilidad permanente, altamente rentables para los empleadores.

El texto analiza cómo esta hipocresía se traduce en una tensión social y política: los inmigrantes son percibidos como necesarios pero indeseables, útiles pero molestos.

Con esta resolución, que ya es firme y contra la que no cabe recurso, la Justicia respalda la actuación del consistorio gallego al considerar que los mensajes difundidos se encuentran amparados por el derecho constitucional a la libertad de expresión y a la crítica política.

Los paneles municipales estuvieron activos durante varios meses de 2024 y difundieron mensajes contrarios a la intervención militar del Estado de Israel en la Franja de Gaza, así como condenas explícitas al trato infligido a la población palestina.

En una entrevista reciente, el artista destacó que la hostilidad percibida hacia China es más un reflejo de la incapacidad de Occidente para competir con el país asiático que una amenaza real de hostilidad. Ai argumenta que, históricamente, fue el Imperio Británico el que invadió China, pero hoy en día, China ha logrado posicionarse como una potencia global mediante el trabajo arduo de su población, mientras que Occidente, más relajado en su enfoque laboral, ha comenzado a perder terreno. Además, señaló que, a pesar de que Occidente se beneficia de productos como el iPhone, la balanza económica favorece a China, que ha experimentado un rápido crecimiento en las últimas décadas.

La polémica se intensificó tras conocerse que la entonces concejala de Urbanismo, familiares directos de la jefa del área municipal de Contratación y un arquitecto municipal figuraban entre los socios cooperativistas. La situación derivó en la dimisión de la edil de Urbanismo y de una alta responsable municipal, así como en peticiones de explicaciones por parte de PSOE, Compromís y Sumar, este último con una denuncia ante la Fiscalía Anticorrupción.

El reto es gestionar bien estas habilidades para superar los niveles, ya que cada vez se presentan desafíos más difíciles. A medida que avanzan los niveles, los obstáculos aumentan, poniendo a prueba la estrategia y la creatividad del jugador. El control se realiza únicamente con el ratón, y cada fase superada permite al jugador obtener un código para continuar desde allí.

En la entrevista, Portero explica que este libro fue escrito en un momento vital extremadamente oscuro, durante su proceso de transición, cuando no esperaba sobrevivir a lo que estaba escribiendo. Define el poemario como un grito final, un testamento literario y vital, en el que se expone de forma absoluta, sin parapetos metafóricos, abordando la angustia de no poder vivir la vida que sentía como propia.

El texto subraya la dimensión vengativa de su gobierno, tanto contra antiguos adversarios políticos como mediante el indulto o la recompensa a aliados implicados en prácticas delictivas.

En política interior, Bassets describe un endurecimiento extremo: militarización de la gestión migratoria, discurso xenófobo y racista, y una ofensiva cultural contra lo que el trumpismo denomina políticas “woke”.

Más allá del impacto visual de las fotografías, los archivos incluyen correos electrónicos que comprometen aún más la figura del duque de York. En uno de ellos, fechado en agosto de 2010, Epstein promete a Andrés enviarle a Londres a una joven rusa de 26 años, descrita como “inteligente y hermosa”, y afirma que ya dispone de su dirección de correo electrónico.

Los documentos mencionan un pago de 1.050 euros y el envío de dos paquetes a nombre de Aznar. Aunque estas acciones se realizaron antes de que se conocieran públicamente los escándalos de Epstein, la noticia ha generado un debate intenso en redes sociales, especialmente en X, sobre la cobertura mediática desigual según la ideología política. Muchos usuarios critican que la aparición de Aznar ha recibido poca atención mediática en comparación con lo que ocurriría si se tratase de figuras políticas de izquierdas, como Pedro Sánchez o Pablo Iglesias. Los comentarios reflejan una percepción de doble rasero: mientras que implicados de izquierdas recibirían cobertura exhaustiva y debates prolongados, figuras de derechas parecen pasar desapercibidas.

Algunos miembros de la comunidad islámica local solicitaron que se retirara el objeto, considerándolo de mal gusto y potencialmente ofensivo para los musulmanes. Sin embargo, no existe ninguna norma legal que prohíba su exposición, y el Ayuntamiento no ha emitido ningún requerimiento oficial. La iniciativa ha dividido opiniones: mientras algunos defienden la libertad comercial y la tradición cultural italiana, otros consideran que los espacios públicos deberían evitar símbolos que puedan herir sensibilidades religiosas. Incluso algunos empleados musulmanes del local han mostrado su apoyo a mantener la figura, argumentando que forma parte de la identidad del comercio y no resulta ofensiva.

El acusado reconoció los hechos y aceptó una pena de ocho meses de prisión, además de dos años de inhabilitación para la tenencia de animales, evitando así la celebración del juicio oral. La pena de cárcel queda suspendida durante dos años con la condición de que no vuelva a delinquir.

La investigación, llevada a cabo por la Guardia Civil, describió una conducta reiterada y extremadamente cruel hacia los animales con los que convivía. Según los informes policiales y la acusación, el hombre golpeaba, pateaba y agredía de forma habitual e injustificada a gatos, un perro y gallinas.

Las restricciones en el acceso a refugios adecuados y medicamentos han dejado a cientos de miles de personas desplazadas viviendo en tiendas de campaña y estructuras temporales, expuestas a frío extremo, humedad y falta de higiene básica. Este invierno, al menos diez bebés menores de un año han muerto por hipotermia, elevando a más de dos docenas las víctimas infantiles desde el inicio del conflicto. Los expertos médicos han acuñado el término “síndrome de la tienda mojada” para describir las enfermedades y complicaciones derivadas de estas condiciones extremas, que afectan principalmente a niños, ancianos, embarazadas y enfermos crónicos. La falta de acceso a medicación esencial, como inhaladores y analgésicos, agrava la crisis sanitaria, mientras que los hospitales locales luchan por atender complicaciones respiratorias y brotes de gripe.

El autismo es una condición del neurodesarrollo de origen neurobiológico y genético que acompaña a la persona durante toda su vida, y no existe evidencia que indique que pueda ser causado o revertido mediante vacunas o tratamientos alternativos.

Según el escritor español Santiago Posteguillo, la fascinación por César reside en que poseía cualidades ausentes en los políticos actuales, especialmente la capacidad de cumplir sus promesas. Su última obra, 'Los tres mundos', cierra la trilogía dedicada a su vida, abordando sus campañas militares en la Galia, Britania y Germania, y su influencia política en Roma junto a Pompeyo y Craso. Posteguillo destaca la complejidad del personaje: si bien se le conoce como dictador, era generoso con sus enemigos y tenía una vida privada significativa, marcada por pérdidas personales. Además, César combinaba el arte de la guerra con la oratoria y la cultura, algo poco frecuente en líderes contemporáneos. El autor subraya que César entendía la importancia de comunicar y controlar el relato, anticipándose a conceptos similares al periodismo moderno.

La iniciativa responde a una demanda histórica de los vecinos del sur de la región, que reclaman una mejora sustancial en las conexiones de transporte público entre ambos municipios y con el resto del área metropolitana madrileña.

Actualmente, la línea 10 finaliza su recorrido en la estación de Puerta del Sur, situada en Alcorcón. El proyecto planteado propone prolongar el trazado desde ese punto con el objetivo de integrar nuevos barrios en la red ferroviaria. En concreto, la moción contempla la creación de una nueva estación en el Ensanche Sur de Alcorcón y otra parada en el barrio de Villafontana, ya en Móstoles, antes de enlazar con la estación existente de Manuela Malasaña.

El detonante más reciente llega desde Francia, donde algunos trenes de alta velocidad han habilitado vagones sin niños menores de 12 años, una medida que recuerda al coche en silencio del AVE español, donde no se permite viajar a menores de 14 años ni a mascotas.

A través de ejemplos concretos, el reportaje analiza hasta qué punto estas decisiones responden a una discriminación hacia los niños o, por el contrario, a una falta de control y educación por parte de algunos padres. Restauradores, hoteleros y responsables de negocios turísticos explican que, en muchos casos, no se trata de rechazar a los menores, sino de garantizar una convivencia mínima en espacios que no están pensados para el ruido, el juego o la supervisión constante.

El origen del problema se sitúa en 1921, cuando el ingeniero Thomas Midgley, trabajando para General Motors, descubrió que añadir tetraetilo de plomo a la gasolina evitaba el llamado ‘golpeo del motor’, un fallo común en los primeros motores de combustión. Este hallazgo permitió mejorar el rendimiento de los vehículos y aceleró la expansión del automóvil, pero tuvo un coste humano y ambiental gigantesco.

A pesar de que la toxicidad del plomo era conocida desde la Antigüedad, las empresas implicadas —General Motors, Exxon y DuPont— impulsaron su uso mediante campañas de marketing que ocultaban el riesgo, rebautizando el aditivo como “Etil”. Incluso el propio Midgley llegó a inhalar el gas en público para tranquilizar a la opinión pública.

El asentamiento, perteneciente al pueblo íbero de los sedetanos y destruido violentamente durante las guerras sertorianas (76-72 a.C.), ofrece una imagen excepcional de cómo la escritura formaba parte de la vida cotidiana y no era un recurso exclusivo de las élites.

Las inscripciones aparecen mayoritariamente sobre cerámica: platos, cuencos, tapaderas, pesas y ánforas. En la vajilla de barniz negro importada de Italia, considerada un bien de prestigio, predominan grafitos breves y discretos, a menudo una sola letra, probablemente usados para identificar la propiedad sin dañar la estética del objeto.

Según la propia asociación, el contenido del texto expone supuestos casos de corrupción que, a su juicio, afectan al Ejecutivo español y establece vínculos políticos entre Pedro Sánchez, el expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero y el régimen venezolano de Nicolás Maduro.

Hazte Oír presenta esta acción como una prolongación de la campaña que ya desarrolló en España con la colocación de una lona frente al Congreso de los Diputados, en la que calificaba al presidente como “corrupto”. Aquella actuación provocó la apertura de una investigación judicial en Madrid.

Los bombardeos se produjeron en varias partes de la Franja, como el norte y el sur, y uno de los ataques involucró un dron que mató a un padre y sus hijos en Jan Yunis. En el norte de Gaza, otro bombardeo acabó con la vida de una madre y tres de sus hijos. Estos ataques se dan a pesar de la existencia de un alto el fuego que había entrado en vigor en octubre de 2025, y a pesar de que la violencia parecía haberse calmado temporalmente. Con esta nueva tragedia, la cifra de palestinos muertos desde el alto el fuego supera ya los 500, incluyendo más de cien niños. Estos ataques se suman a más de mil incidentes desde el inicio de la tregua y demuestran la falta de respeto por los acuerdos de alto el fuego por parte de Israel.

La Constitución otorga a los estados la principal autoridad electoral y fija fechas concretas tanto para los comicios como para la toma de posesión del nuevo Congreso, lo que reduce de forma drástica el margen de maniobra presidencial.

El texto repasa las hipótesis más extremas, como la declaración de la ley marcial o el uso de la Ley de Insurrección, y concluye que, además de dudosas desde el punto de vista legal, resultarían impracticables a nivel logístico en un país donde votan más de cien millones de personas.

Las principales aseguradoras de salud han iniciado una corrección de márgenes que se traduce en subidas generalizadas de las primas, con incrementos que oscilan entre el 12% y el 20% en las renovaciones anuales. Estas subidas superan ampliamente la inflación general y se justifican, según el sector, por el aumento de la llamada inflación médica, que ya alcanza el 8,4% debido al encarecimiento de tratamientos avanzados, especialmente oncológicos, y a la actualización de tarifas de los grandes grupos hospitalarios.

Sin embargo, el aspecto que más malestar está generando entre los asegurados no es solo el encarecimiento de las pólizas, sino el uso creciente de la cláusula de no renovación por siniestralidad. Muchas compañías están optando por no prorrogar los contratos de clientes que presentan enfermedades crónicas, patologías previas o un elevado uso del seguro, una práctica legal pero controvertida.

A su juicio, el principal error progresista ha sido no combatir con suficiente eficacia el discurso de la extrema derecha que culpa a la inmigración del deterioro de los servicios públicos, cuando —sostiene— los verdaderos responsables son las políticas fiscales y de privatización impulsadas por los gobiernos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Bergerot señala directamente a los grandes patrimonios y a los millonarios que, según afirma, han encontrado en Madrid un auténtico paraíso fiscal gracias a la supresión y rebaja de impuestos autonómicos, lo que ha supuesto dejar de recaudar miles de millones de euros al año.

Según una nueva estadística experimental del Banco de España, el 10% de los hogares con mayor riqueza concentra ya el 42% del valor total de la vivienda residencial, lo que equivale a unos 2,6 billones de euros. En contraste, la mitad más pobre de la población apenas acumula el 12,5% de ese valor, alrededor de 776.000 millones de euros. Esta brecha no es coyuntural, sino el resultado de una tendencia sostenida que se ha intensificado con el paso del tiempo.

Los datos, correspondientes a la primera mitad de 2025, muestran que desde 2011 la concentración de la riqueza inmobiliaria ha aumentado de forma clara. En aquel año, el 10% más rico poseía el 34,3% del valor de las viviendas, mientras que el 50% más pobre alcanzaba el 20,6%.

Según recoge elEconomista a partir de análisis de expertos citados por Bloomberg, las políticas de control migratorio aplicadas por Donald Trump desde el inicio de su segundo mandato estarían reduciendo de forma notable la aportación de la inmigración al crecimiento poblacional. Las últimas proyecciones oficiales del censo, publicadas en 2023, situaban la primera caída de población en torno a 2081, pero algunos analistas consideran que ese escenario podría adelantarse de manera significativa, incluso a 2026 en el escenario más extremo.

Este desplome se produjo tras la publicación de sus resultados trimestrales, que mostraron un gasto récord de 37.500 millones de dólares en inteligencia artificial, mientras que su unidad de computación en la nube, Azure, experimentó una desaceleración en su crecimiento. La noticia generó preocupación entre los inversores sobre la rentabilidad de las inversiones masivas en IA realizadas por las grandes tecnológicas. Este movimiento bursátil ha tenido un efecto contagio en otras compañías, con pérdidas significativas para Alphabet y Nvidia, aunque Alphabet logró recuperarse parcialmente al cerrar con un ligero aumento.

De acuerdo con un portavoz del gobernador designado por los rebeldes en la zona, entre las víctimas hay mineros artesanales, así como mujeres y niños que se encontraban en el lugar. Algunas personas pudieron ser rescatadas con vida, aunque varias sufrieron heridas graves y al menos una veintena estaba siendo atendida en centros sanitarios cercanos.

Las Médulas, declaradas Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO, combinan un enorme valor histórico, arqueológico y paisajístico, por lo que la magnitud del incendio generó una fuerte preocupación social e institucional.

Según el estudio, el fuego afectó principalmente a la vegetación superficial y a determinadas zonas del suelo, pero no produjo una degradación estructural profunda que impida la regeneración natural.

El episodio tuvo lugar en un evento dirigido a jóvenes en una discoteca de la capital aragonesa, en el marco del arranque de la breve campaña electoral previa a las elecciones autonómicas del 8 de febrero.

Durante la intervención de Ayuso, un asistente interrumpió su discurso acusándola de ser “cómplice de un genocidio” en referencia a la ofensiva militar de Israel en Gaza. El joven reprochó a la dirigente popular su defensa explícita del Estado israelí y la contradicción, a su juicio, entre el discurso de valores que sostiene Ayuso y el respaldo a una actuación militar que ha causado miles de víctimas civiles.

Fanon decidió transformar su intervención en la lectura de un manifiesto crítico y abandonar el escenario sin aceptar preguntas, gesto que fue recibido con aplausos por parte del público.

En su texto y en posteriores declaraciones a EL PAÍS, Fanon sostiene que Machado representa una expresión contemporánea del fascismo, al que vincula con el colonialismo, la supremacía blanca y la extrema derecha internacional.

Esta interpretación se recoge en la consulta vinculante V1261-25, de 9 de julio de 2025, que analiza el caso de un matrimonio de más de 65 años que desea donar el pleno dominio de su vivienda habitual a sus descendientes.

Con carácter general, la donación de un inmueble supone una alteración del patrimonio del donante y puede generar una ganancia o pérdida patrimonial que, normalmente, debe declararse en el IRPF. Sin embargo, la normativa fiscal contempla una exención específica para las transmisiones de la vivienda habitual realizadas por contribuyentes mayores de 65 años.

Sin embargo, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) mantiene que el invierno 2025-2026 tiene altas probabilidades de ser más cálido de lo normal y, hasta la fecha, no ha registrado ninguna ola de frío oficial. Esta aparente contradicción se explica por la diferencia entre la percepción cotidiana del tiempo y los criterios climatológicos con los que se elaboran los pronósticos estacionales.

La previsión de AEMET no afirmaba que no fuera a hacer frío en ningún momento, sino que asignaba entre un 60 % y un 70 % de probabilidad a que la temperatura media del trimestre (diciembre, enero y febrero) estuviera por encima de la media histórica.

Durante años, la investigación se centró en cómo el cerebro influía en el aparato digestivo, sobre todo en situaciones de estrés. Sin embargo, la neurociencia actual está demostrando que el flujo de información también va en sentido contrario: lo que ocurre en el intestino condiciona de forma directa la actividad cerebral y, en última instancia, nuestra conducta y bienestar emocional.

Castellanos destaca el papel del eje intestino-cerebro y de una región cerebral clave, la ínsula, donde se integran las señales internas del cuerpo. En esta zona se representa no solo el estado físico interno, sino también aspectos ligados a la identidad personal. Desde esta perspectiva, el 'yo' no se entiende sin el cuerpo, lo que rompe con la tradicional separación entre mente y organismo.

La decisión ha reavivado el malestar vecinal, ya que residentes y asociaciones del entorno aseguran que los problemas actuales eran previsibles y fueron advertidos al Ayuntamiento desde el inicio del proyecto.

Según los vecinos, la intervención original no respondió a las necesidades reales del espacio ni a su carácter histórico.

Los hechos ocurrieron el 18 de enero, cuando Lemon entró en la iglesia Cities Church, en St. Paul, junto a un grupo de manifestantes que denunciaban que uno de los pastores era funcionario de ICE. La protesta interrumpió un servicio religioso y derivó en momentos de tensión entre los asistentes y los activistas.

Lemon fue detenido días después, el jueves por la noche, en Los Ángeles, mientras cubría los premios Grammy. Tras comparecer ante un tribunal federal, quedó en libertad.

Esta idea, defendida por algunos físicos y filósofos de la ciencia, surge al intentar reconciliar dos de los grandes pilares de la física moderna: la relatividad general, que describe el comportamiento del espacio-tiempo a gran escala, y la mecánica cuántica, que rige el mundo subatómico.

En ciertos modelos teóricos, especialmente en propuestas de gravedad cuántica, el tiempo deja de aparecer como una variable básica. En su lugar, el universo se describe mediante relaciones entre estados físicos, sin una evolución temporal clara. Desde esta perspectiva, el paso del tiempo podría ser una ilusión emergente, resultado de cómo el cerebro humano interpreta los cambios y el orden de los acontecimientos.

Este enfoque permite a personas sin amplios conocimientos de programación desarrollar apps funcionales utilizando lenguaje natural y modelos de inteligencia artificial generativa, como Claude de Anthropic, en lugar de escribir código de forma tradicional.

Gracias a esta democratización, la App Store ha experimentado un crecimiento exponencial de nuevas aplicaciones: según datos de Sensor Tower citados por a16z, en diciembre de 2025 se registró un aumento interanual del 60 %, mientras que el conjunto del año creció un 24 %. Este repunte recuerda al boom inicial de la App Store en 2008 tras el lanzamiento del SDK del iPhone, cuando las barreras técnicas impedían que muchas ideas se convirtieran en realidad.

La investigación comenzó en enero tras dos hurtos cometidos en oficinas bancarias de Sevilla y Málaga, en los que los sospechosos lograron hacerse con más de 100.000 euros. En uno de los casos sustrajeron directamente el cajetín registrador y en otro aprovecharon una maniobra de distracción: un empleado salió de la sucursal para ayudar a una persona que fingía tener la tarjeta atascada, momento en el que robaron una elevada cantidad de dinero que había quedado sobre la mesa.

Uno de los episodios más extraordinarios de su historia tuvo lugar en noviembre de 1971, cuando Alvechurch y Oxford City, dos equipos semiprofesionales, disputaron la eliminatoria más larga jamás vista en el torneo. El enfrentamiento necesitó seis partidos de desempate y un total de 660 minutos de juego para resolverse.

La serie comenzó con un empate 2-2 en el campo del Alvechurch y continuó con sucesivos empates en distintos estadios de las Midlands, incluyendo White House Ground, Manor Ground, St. Andrew’s y finalmente Villa Park. Los jugadores compaginaban el fútbol con sus trabajos diarios en fábricas, escuelas o en la construcción, lo que añadía un componente de sacrificio y desgaste físico.

Aunque el pacto tiene un claro impacto comercial —reducción de aranceles, apertura de mercados y normas concretas y exigibles—, su verdadero significado reside en el contexto político internacional: refleja una creciente voluntad de las grandes economías de reducir su dependencia de Estados Unidos.

Krugman sostiene que este giro es consecuencia directa de la política comercial y exterior errática de la Administración Trump, basada en una visión de suma cero del comercio internacional y en el uso de los aranceles como herramienta de presión. Frente a ello, la UE e India entienden el libre comercio como una relación mutuamente beneficiosa entre dos economías de enorme tamaño y carácter complementario.

Su muerte se produjo mientras permanecía ingresado a la espera de una intervención quirúrgica, tras varias semanas en las que su estado de salud había sido delicado. La noticia ha causado un notable impacto en la escena musical andaluza y especialmente en el entorno del flamenco-rock, donde su aportación fue muy valorada.

Davile está considerado una de las piezas importantes en el desarrollo de la llamada cultura garrapatera, un estilo nacido en Jerez de la Frontera que mezcla flamenco, rumba, rock y una lírica de inspiración callejera. Durante los años noventa formó parte del proyecto Palocortao junto a Diego Pozo, etapa que sería decisiva en su trayectoria musical.

Según dichas cifras, cerca de 70.000 palestinos habrían muerto como consecuencia de las acciones militares israelíes entre octubre de 2023 y octubre de 2025. Un alto mando militar israelí transmitió a corresponsales nacionales que esos datos podían darse por buenos, lo que suponía un cambio relevante respecto a la postura mantenida durante gran parte del conflicto, en la que Israel cuestionaba de forma sistemática los recuentos gazatíes.

Sin embargo, al día siguiente, el portavoz internacional de las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel aclaró en redes sociales que esas cifras no reflejaban datos oficiales del Ejército y que cualquier información válida se difundiría por los canales reglamentarios.

Concebido como secuela del exitoso Renegade (1986), el título forma parte de una etapa clave en la expansión de los arcades hacia el mercado doméstico durante la edad de oro del videojuego. La historia, aunque secundaria, sirve como excusa para la acción: el protagonista, conocido simplemente como Renegado, recorre las calles de una ciudad dominada por bandas criminales con el objetivo de vengarse del mafioso Mr. Big, responsable del asesinato o secuestro de su hermano Matt, según la versión.

El juego apuesta por una jugabilidad de desplazamiento lateral, centrada en el combate cuerpo a cuerpo contra numerosos enemigos repartidos en cinco niveles.

Los condados rurales que apoyaron masivamente a Donald Trump en 2024, con hasta un 78% de los votos en zonas dependientes de la agricultura, ahora enfrentan graves dificultades económicas. La imposición de aranceles durante la administración Trump redujo drásticamente los ingresos de los agricultores, especialmente en cultivos como el maíz, la soja y el algodón, mientras que China, gran comprador de soja estadounidense, dejó de comprar completamente. Además, las estrictas políticas de inmigración provocaron la escasez de mano de obra en el campo, dejando frutas y verduras sin cosechar y pérdidas millonarias para los productores.

El documento, firmado el 30 de enero de 2025 en la Casa Rosada, designaba a Davis como asesor ad honorem en tecnologías blockchain e inteligencia artificial para el Estado argentino, apenas dos semanas antes de que el criptoactivo saliera al mercado.

Aunque el acuerdo establecía explícitamente que el asesoramiento sería gratuito y sin contraprestación económica, la Comisión Investigadora del Congreso detectó movimientos financieros sospechosos ocurridos el mismo día de la firma. Dos billeteras digitales atribuidas a Davis transfirieron un total de 1.014.000 dólares en USDC a un intermediario jubilado, quien derivó esos fondos a una presunta “cueva cripto” en menos de tres horas.

Redgrave, ya entonces una actriz consagrada, había defendido públicamente la causa palestina y mantenido contactos con la OLP, lo que provocó protestas y tensiones previas a la gala, especialmente por parte de la Liga de la Defensa Judía.

La noche de la ceremonia, celebrada en el Dorothy Chandler Pavilion de Los Ángeles, la actriz confirmó que no pensaba autocensurarse. Tras agradecer el premio, dedicó el Oscar a quienes lucharon contra el fascismo y denunció lo que calificó como presiones e intimidaciones de un “pequeño grupo de sionistas rufianes”. Sus palabras generaron una reacción inmediata y dividida en la sala, marcando un antes y un después en la relación entre política y espectáculo en Hollywood.

En ese contexto, su administración planteó a Mercedes-Benz la posibilidad de trasladar su sede central desde Alemania a territorio estadounidense. La propuesta incluía incentivos fiscales y otras ventajas económicas con la idea de “americanizar” la marca y aumentar la presencia de empresas globales con base en EE. UU.

Según explicó Ola Källenius, consejero delegado de Mercedes-Benz, en una entrevista con el medio alemán The Pioneer, la iniciativa fue trasladada formalmente por el entonces secretario de Comercio, Howard Lutnick. Sin embargo, la compañía ni siquiera llegó a estudiar seriamente la opción. La dirección de Mercedes consideró que su identidad histórica y cultural está profundamente ligada a Alemania, país donde nació la marca y donde mantiene su núcleo tecnológico y de decisión.

El joven escritor David Uclés, autor del exitoso libro 'La península de las casas vacías' y reciente ganador del Premio Nadal, rechazó participar en el evento al considerar que el título equiparaba a ambos bandos de la Guerra Civil y diluía la responsabilidad del golpe de Estado franquista, además de objetar la presencia de figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros. Tras su retirada, otros participantes como Antonio Maíllo, María Márquez y la historiadora Zira Box también se bajaron, lo que llevó a la Fundación Cajasol a aplazar el ciclo hasta el otoño.

Por su parte, Podemos niega estas acusaciones y asegura que lo que buscaban eran movimientos que redujeran la subordinación de IU al PSOE. Las conversaciones, lideradas principalmente por Pablo Fernández, secretario de Organización estatal de Podemos, se desarrollaron mayoritariamente por vía telemática, lo que, según IU, complicó alcanzar acuerdos.

May, de 78 años, explicó que, en el hipotético caso de que Queen retomara los conciertos en el futuro, Estados Unidos probablemente no figuraría entre los destinos elegidos. El músico lamentó especialmente esta situación, ya que considera que la banda creció artísticamente en América y mantiene un profundo vínculo con el público estadounidense.

Uno de los paquetes fue enviado cuando Aznar todavía era presidente del Gobierno, al Palacio de La Moncloa, y otro al año siguiente a la Fundación FAES, ya fuera del cargo. Los recibos muestran los nombres del expresidente y de su esposa, pero las fuentes del entorno de Aznar aseguran que no tienen conocimiento de estos envíos y que no conocen personalmente a Epstein. Además, en los archivos se menciona un cargo a nombre de 'Jose María Aznar' para la adquisición de billetes de avión, aunque no está claro si se refiere al expresidente o a su hijo, que también aparece en contactos de negocios de Epstein en esa época.

Esta medida se produce tras el rechazo de Canadá a certificar los aviones Gulfstream 500, 600, 700 y 800, considerados por Trump entre los más avanzados tecnológicamente. Como represalia, Estados Unidos retirará la certificación de todos los aviones canadienses, incluidos los fabricados por Bombardier, principal fabricante de Canadá. La amenaza de Trump se publicó en su red social Truth Social y se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de tensiones comerciales, ya que la semana pasada advirtió con aranceles del 100% si Canadá firmaba acuerdos con China. La disputa recuerda a anteriores conflictos comerciales, como los aranceles impuestos a Bombardier en 2017, aunque entonces la Comisión de Comercio Internacional estadounidense dictaminó que la compañía canadiense no había perjudicado a la industria]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-amenaza-a-canada-con-aranceles-del-50-a-aviones-tras-disputa-por-certificacion-de-gulfstream</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-amenaza-a-canada-con-aranceles-del-50-a-aviones-tras-disputa-por-certificacion-de-gulfstream</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alstom refuerza su liderazgo ferroviario en Europa tras cerrar grandes contratos de trenes y mantenimiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alstom ha cerrado el ejercicio fiscal 2024/25 con una intensa actividad comercial que refuerza su posición como uno de los principales actores del sector ferroviario europeo. La compañía ha registrado pedidos por valor de 19.800 millones de euros y unas ventas que alcanzan los 18.500 millones, cifras que reflejan un crecimiento sostenido respecto al ejercicio anterior y una sólida demanda de soluciones ferroviarias en el continente.

El buen desempeño financiero se explica, según la empresa, por la diversificación de su cartera de proyectos y por el impulso de la modernización del transporte ferroviario en Europa. En este contexto, Alstom ha logrado adjudicarse varios contratos estratégicos de material rodante y servicios asociados, especialmente en mercados clave como Alemania e Italia.

Entre los acuerdos más relevantes destaca el contrato en Alemania para el suministro de trenes y la gestión del mantenimiento de la S-Bahn de Renania, una de las redes de cercanías más importantes del]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alstom-refuerza-su-liderazgo-ferroviario-en-europa-tras-cerrar-grandes-contratos-de-trenes-y-mantenimiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alstom-refuerza-su-liderazgo-ferroviario-en-europa-tras-cerrar-grandes-contratos-de-trenes-y-mantenimiento</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Críticas desde EE.

Según Ekaizer, las críticas públicas del secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, Scott Bessent, hacia la política de defensa española y otras posiciones internacionales reflejarían una estrategia de Washington para influir en el escenario político español. Desde el Foro Económico Mundial de Davos, Bessent reprochó a España no aumentar suficientemente el gasto en defensa en el marco de la OTAN y vinculó al expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero con el entorno del Gobierno venezolano de Nicolás Maduro, sugiriendo que la salida de Maduro habría supuesto un revés para Sánchez.

A pesar de que la compañía superó las expectativas de ingresos y beneficios, los mercados han reaccionado con fuerte desconfianza ante el elevado gasto de capital dirigido a infraestructura de inteligencia artificial y el crecimiento más lento de su división de nube, Azure. Las acciones llegaron a caer cerca del 10-12%, borrando cientos de miles de millones de dólares de capitalización bursátil, convirtiéndose en uno de los mayores retrocesos en valor en un solo día en la historia reciente de la empresa. La razón principal detrás de esta reacción negativa es la percepción de que la estrategia agresiva de inversión en IA —incluyendo hardware especializado y dependencia de OpenAI— todavía no está generando retornos claros a corto plazo y presiona los márgenes de beneficio.

Correos electrónicos de 2012 y 2013 muestran intercambios entre Musk y Epstein, así como con Lesley Groff, asistente de Epstein, en los que Musk pregunta sobre fechas y logística para visitar Little St. James. En los mensajes, Musk menciona que viajaría con Talulah Riley, su entonces pareja, y consulta cuándo sería la 'fiesta más salvaje' en la isla. A pesar de estos intercambios, Musk ha declarado públicamente que nunca visitó la isla y que nunca ha sido acusado formalmente de ningún delito relacionado con Epstein. Los correos se produjeron años después de que Epstein fuera condenado en 2008 por delitos sexuales y asegurara un acuerdo favorable que le evitó cargos federales por tráfico sexual.

Profesores como Eugenia G., nacida y trabajando en Madrid, han tenido que mudarse a localidades cercanas en Valladolid debido a los altos precios del alquiler, lo que les obliga a desplazarse varias horas al día para llegar a sus centros educativos. Esta situación también afecta a interinos, que reciben sueldos insuficientes para cubrir los gastos de vivir en Madrid y a menudo deben compartir piso en condiciones precarias o regresar a sus ciudades de origen. La consecuencia es un creciente éxodo de docentes, lo que deja cientos de plazas sin cubrir y dificulta la estabilidad educativa.

Estos mensajes forman parte de borradores aparentemente destinados a Boris Nikolic, exasesor de Gates en su fundación, en los que se menciona el fin de la amistad de seis años entre Epstein y Gates, y se alegan otras conductas cuestionables como facilitar encuentros con mujeres casadas o proporcionar Adderall sin prescripción.

La medida responde a los últimos informes científicos, que describen una situación crítica para la especie. La anguila se encuentra fuera de los límites biológicos de seguridad, con una tendencia regresiva sostenida y un acusado descenso de sus poblaciones desde las décadas de 1970 y 1980. La escasez en los ríos y estuarios, unida a la presión pesquera, la fragmentación de los ecosistemas fluviales y otros factores ambientales, sitúan a la especie al borde de la desaparición.

Esta acción se produce tras el ataque militar estadounidense en Venezuela el 3 de enero de 2026, que resultó en el derrocamiento y captura de Nicolás Maduro, lo que ha cortado los envíos de petróleo venezolano a Cuba. La orden acusa al Gobierno cubano de alinearse con países como Rusia, China e Irán, así como con grupos como Hamás y Hezbolá, y de apoyar el terrorismo, desestabilizar la región mediante migración y violencia, y obstaculizar los intereses estadounidenses en el hemisferio occidental.

Inicialmente, las jornadas se presentaron bajo el lema ‘1936: La guerra que todos perdimos’, un título que posteriormente apareció con signos de interrogación. Pérez-Reverte atribuyó ese cambio a un supuesto error de maquetación, pero varios invitados y fuentes vinculadas a la organización sostienen que ese error no existió y que el título se mantuvo sin interrogantes durante meses en comunicaciones y borradores.

La controversia creció cuando algunos participantes anunciaron su retirada al conocer la presencia en el cartel de figuras políticas como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros.

El alcalde de Alicante, Luis Barcala (PP), ha afirmado en el pleno municipal que, si existe el menor indicio de irregularidad, llevará el caso “directa y personalmente” a la Fiscalía.

Aunque en 2013 John Kerry había proclamado simbólicamente la muerte de esta doctrina, expertos consultados por la BBC sostienen que nunca desapareció realmente y que hoy vuelve con un tono más explícito y menos disfrazado de valores universales.

El texto explica que la Doctrina Monroe, formulada en 1823 bajo el lema “América para los americanos”, nació para frenar la recolonización europea tras las independencias latinoamericanas. Sin embargo, con el paso del tiempo fue reinterpretada mediante diversos corolarios que ampliaron el margen de intervención de EE.UU. en la región, destacando el Corolario Roosevelt de 1904 y la política del “gran garrote”, que legitimó intervenciones militares y contr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-regreso-de-la-doctrina-monroe-y-la-disputa-de-estados-unidos-y-china-por-la-influencia-en-america-latina</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-regreso-de-la-doctrina-monroe-y-la-disputa-de-estados-unidos-y-china-por-la-influencia-en-america-latina</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audiencia Nacional concede 17.300 euros de indemnización a un lucense absuelto tras 652 días en prisión preventiva]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un vecino de Lugo pasó 652 días en prisión provisional desde mayo de 2012 hasta febrero de 2014, acusado de un delito del que finalmente fue absuelto. Tras su liberación, inició un largo proceso judicial para reclamar una indemnización por los daños morales y económicos sufridos, solicitando un total de 217.033 euros. El Ministerio de Justicia denegó inicialmente la petición en 2016, decisión confirmada por la Audiencia Nacional en 2017. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Constitucional estimó su recurso de amparo en 2019 y ordenó revisar el caso respetando los derechos a la igualdad y la presunción de inocencia.

En 2022, el Ministerio reconoció una indemnización de 17.300 euros únicamente por daño moral. El afectado recurrió esta cantidad, exigiendo compensación por tres conceptos: privación de libertad (85.000 euros más 24.000 euros adicionales), alteración psicológica (18.000 euros) y cierre de su negocio de hostelería con pérdida de ingresos (90.000 euros).

Los hechos se remontan al 18 de enero, cuando Lemon acudió a la iglesia Cities Church, en St. Paul, para documentar una protesta relacionada con las políticas migratorias, el papel del ICE y el asesinato de Renee Good, ocurrido días antes. En ese templo ejerce como pastor un funcionario local del propio ICE, circunstancia que había generado una fuerte contestación social.

Aunque Lemon fue arrestado en Los Ángeles, donde se encontraba cubriendo la entrega de los premios Grammy, su abogado, Abbe Lowell, sostiene que el periodista actuaba exclusivamente en el ejercicio de su labor profesional y no tenía ninguna vinculación con el grupo que interrumpió el servicio religioso.

Impulsada por trece asociaciones de familias y AMPAs, con el respaldo de los propios centros, equipos directivos, ayuntamientos y más de 700 docentes, representa a unas 4.000 familias y 5.000 alumnos. Su objetivo principal es coordinar esfuerzos locales para fortalecer la educación pública, compartir recursos, dar visibilidad a las escuelas pequeñas y defenderla frente a los retos actuales, especialmente el invierno demográfico que provoca cierres de líneas y fusiones.

Las portavoces, como Eider Bilbao (directora de Bermeoko Herri Eskola) y Nahia Idoiaga (profesora en la UPV/EHU y madre de alumnado), denuncian que los ajustes por la caída de la natalidad no se aplican de forma equitativa y benefician a la red concertada, que]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-de-la-red-danon-eskola-publikoa-en-busturia-para-defender-la-escuela-publica-en-urdaibai-ante-el-descenso-demografico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-de-la-red-danon-eskola-publikoa-en-busturia-para-defender-la-escuela-publica-en-urdaibai-ante-el-descenso-demografico</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Por qué el trumpismo ha evolucionado hacia un modelo de gobierno claramente fascista]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Jonathan Rauch sostiene que, tras años evitando el término por su uso abusivo y su definición imprecisa, ya no es posible esquivar la palabra “fascismo” para describir el modelo de gobierno de Donald Trump en su segundo mandato. El autor parte de una posición inicialmente prudente: durante años consideró que Trump encajaba mejor en el patrimonialismo, una forma de gobernar basada en tratar el Estado como propiedad personal y exigir lealtad al líder. Sin embargo, Rauch argumenta que ese diagnóstico se ha quedado corto ante la deriva ideológica, represiva y sistemática del trumpismo reciente.

El texto enumera una constelación de rasgos característicos del fascismo contemporáneo que, en conjunto, dibujan un patrón coherente. Entre ellos destaca la demolición deliberada de normas democráticas y de la decencia cívica, el uso performativo y propagandístico de la violencia, y la glorificación del poder y la fuerza como principios políticos.

Además, introduce nuevas exigencias administrativas destinadas a asegurar estándares mínimos de calidad. Cinco universidades —la española Universidad de las Hespérides y cuatro centros extranjeros (CIS, Schiller, Saint Louis y Francisco Marroquín)— habían presentado un recurso pidiendo que se suspendieran algunas disposiciones del decreto, alegando que las nuevas obligaciones limitarían su capacidad de competir y que el plazo para adaptarse era insuficiente.

El autor utiliza este suceso para cuestionar no solo la gestión sanitaria, sino también la manera en que los medios y la sociedad jerarquizan las muertes según su relevancia informativa.

El texto sostiene que a la sanidad pública no se le exige la inmortalidad, sino una atención de calidad y, llegado el momento, una muerte digna. En el caso relatado, ninguna de las dos cosas se cumplió. La gerencia sanitaria se disculpó alegando una situación puntual de sobrecarga asistencial y afirmó que el fallecimiento era “probablemente inevitable”, una expresión que el autor critica por considerarla una forma de diluir responsabilidades.

La ultraderecha, explica, ha sabido disputar la hegemonía cultural utilizando un nuevo lenguaje y adaptándose a las reglas del juego democrático para presentar sus ideas como una opción política legítima más.

Según el texto, estas fuerzas políticas logran conectar con emociones profundas como el miedo, la ansiedad o la sensación de pérdida de estatus, ofreciendo “lugares seguros” simbólicos: identidad nacional, tradición, religión, roles de género o pertenencia cultural.

Los firmantes sostienen que existe abundante documentación y testimonios que contradicen el relato tradicional sobre los hechos de Bellver y la muerte del anarquista Antonio Martín Escudero.

La decisión descarta una propuesta alternativa de subida mayor, del 4,7 %, que habría implicado la obligación de tributar por IRPF.

En el caso de las empleadas de hogar, el nuevo SMI servirá como base para recalcular salarios mensuales, sueldos por horas y cotizaciones, especialmente relevantes en un sector donde abundan los contratos a tiempo parcial. Aunque el salario mínimo seguirá exento de IRPF para quienes solo perciban esa renta, Hacienda recomienda presentar la Declaración de la Renta si ha habido retenciones, ya que podrían existir devoluciones o deducciones aplicables a rentas bajas.

Se pide documentación mercantil completa, como hojas registrales, cuentas anuales desde 2008, contratos, facturas y justificantes de pagos entre el bufete (y su sucesora Global Afteli) y empresas, especialmente del sector gasístico, para verificar si se prestaron servicios reales o si sirvieron como pantalla para comprar influencia en decisiones gubernamentales durante el mandato del PP con Mariano Rajoy.

La fecha asociada al contenido es el 29 de enero de 2026. 'Tirat' es un formato de humor que parodia elementos de la actualidad catalana y española, a menudo con un tono irreverente y crítico, inspirado en estilos cinematográficos o narrativos exagerados. En este caso concreto, según referencias relacionadas, parece tratarse de un tráiler ficticio inspirado en una película (posiblemente una parodia de 'Sirat' o similar), donde se narra de forma cómica la búsqueda desesperada de una hija desaparecida tras intentar coger algo, probablemente con alusiones satíricas a temas sociales o políticos del momento.

La cinta, titulada ‘Melania’, muestra su rutina diaria, la gestión de sus negocios y sus actividades filantrópicas, con un seguimiento desde la mañana hasta la noche. Durante la ‘premiere’ en Washington, a la que acudió acompañada por el presidente, Melania aseguró que el público podrá conocer mejor sus responsabilidades y su día a día como primera dama.

La producción ha contado con una inversión muy elevada: Amazon pagó 40 millones de dólares por los derechos y destinó otros 35 millones a su promoción global. Esta campaña incluyó acciones poco habituales, como la participación de Melania en el toque de campana de la Bolsa de Nueva York y la difusión del filme en espacios internacionales.

El hecho ocurrió tras una operación de ICE en Minneapolis el 9 de enero, en la que cuatro miembros de la tribu fueron detenidos inicialmente; uno fue liberado y los otros tres permanecieron en el centro de Fort Snelling. Líderes tribales, encabezados por el presidente Frank Star Comes Out, han calificado la detención de ilegal, argumentando que estos individuos son ciudadanos estadounidenses por ley y miembros de la nación Oglala Sioux por tratado, por lo que no deberían estar sujetos a medidas de control migratorio. La tribu ha exigido su liberación inmediata y ha negado haber firmado ningún acuerdo de inmigración con ICE, mientras reclama información sobre la base legal de las detenciones.

El proyecto se ha centrado en maniobras internas de depósito, no en la circulación en línea comercial, y persigue mejorar la eficiencia operativa y reducir la carga de trabajo del personal. Según los responsables del proyecto, el sistema permite disminuir los desplazamientos a pie de los operarios y agilizar movimientos como entradas, salidas y recolocaciones de trenes en las instalaciones de mantenimiento.

La base tecnológica del ensayo ha sido una red local de campus 5G, desplegada por una operadora alemana, que proporciona baja latencia y alta fiabilidad en las comunicaciones. Para posibilitar la conducción remota, Alstom ha equipado los trenes con cámaras y sensores adicionales que transmiten imágenes y datos en tiempo real al puesto del controlador. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-prueba-con-exito-la-conduccion-remota-de-trenes-de-cercanias-en-depositos-mediante-5g</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-prueba-con-exito-la-conduccion-remota-de-trenes-de-cercanias-en-depositos-mediante-5g</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo la pimienta negra y las grasas como el aceite de oliva mejoran la absorción de nutrientes de los alimentos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La pimienta negra, originaria de la India y valorada desde hace miles de años, no solo añade sabor a las comidas, sino que también mejora la absorción de nutrientes gracias a la piperina, una sustancia que bloquea transportadores intestinales que expulsan compuestos como vitaminas y carotenoides, permitiendo que más cantidad llegue al torrente sanguíneo. De forma similar, las grasas presentes en el aceite de oliva y la leche forman micelas que facilitan la disolución y el transporte de vitaminas liposolubles (A, D, E y K), que de otro modo pasarían sin absorberse. El profesor David Julian McClements explica que muchos nutrientes quedan atrapados en la matriz alimentaria y requieren masticación o grasa para liberarse y absorberse adecuadamente. Esto es especialmente relevante para personas con problemas de malabsorción, como enfermedad celíaca, Crohn o pancreatitis.

La demanda se produce tras la publicación de un primer testimonio anónimo de violencia sexual difundido por Fallarás y la posterior aparición de numerosos relatos similares en distintos espacios digitales. Hasta 80 mujeres han denunciado episodios de abusos y violencia sexual que atribuyen al artista, describiendo patrones repetidos de abuso de poder en contextos vinculados a su entorno profesional.

El autor critica la romantización de los crímenes coloniales a través de la industria del entretenimiento, como Hollywood, que convirtió en epopeyas heroicas episodios de violencia, racismo y explotación, citando películas como 'Lawrence de Arabia', 'Zulú' o 'Victoria y Abdul'. Destaca el orgullo persistente en Reino Unido por su pasado imperial, respaldado por encuestas y libros que lo presentan como motor de progreso, pese a su legado de conflictos en excolonias.

Poch describe el imperio británico como una dictadura militar con represión constante, deportaciones masivas (162.000 convictos a Australia entre 1788 y 1868) y masacres a poblaciones indígenas.

Desde el punto de vista técnico, los nuevos trenes pueden alcanzar hasta 257 km/h, lo que supone un incremento de 16 km/h respecto a la generación anterior en servicio desde el año 2000. También incorporan sistemas de inclinación activa que permiten tomar curvas con mayor estabilidad y fluidez, contribuyendo a mantener velocidades elevadas en trazados sinuosos.

Uno de los principales problemas detectados es que los hogares europeos mantienen una parte muy elevada de su riqueza en depósitos y efectivo, con baja rentabilidad, mientras que la inversión en renta variable es reducida en comparación con Estados Unidos.

Describe a ambos presentadores como poco moderados, populistas y demagógicos, que utilizan un discurso enfadado y simplista para atraer a un público predispuesto a teorías conspirativas, alarmismo y posturas de ultraderecha.

Este comentario se produjo en una rueda de prensa tras el Consejo de Gobierno, donde también mencionó que estos colectivos y los 'activistas mediáticos' que les apoyan acumulan 143 procesos judiciales perdidos, y contextualizó las muertes en el ámbito nacional, recordando que en España fallecieron más de 120.000 personas por la pandemia sin que el Gobierno central rindiera cuentas suficientes.

El artículo de Cadena SER destaca que no se trata de un hecho aislado, sino de una estrategia comunicativa recurrente de Ayuso cada vez que surge alguna novedad judicial o informativa relacionada con el caso de las residencias. Anteriormente, ya había empleado términos como 'frustrados', 'resentidos' o 'rebotados' para referirse a estos fami]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ayuso-vuelve-a-criticar-a-las-organizaciones-de-familiares-de-victimas-de-residencias-durante-la-pandemia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ayuso-vuelve-a-criticar-a-las-organizaciones-de-familiares-de-victimas-de-residencias-durante-la-pandemia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resurgen declaraciones pasadas de Ayuso sobre su falta de creencias tras la polémica del funeral en La Almudena]]></title><description><![CDATA[La organización por parte de la Comunidad de Madrid de un funeral católico en la catedral de La Almudena por las víctimas del accidente de Adamuz ha generado una intensa polémica política y social. El acto, solicitado por la presidenta regional Isabel Díaz Ayuso al Arzobispado de Madrid, fue cuestionado por sectores que lo interpretaron como un gesto de protagonismo institucional y por el contraste con la ausencia de homenajes similares a otras tragedias, como las muertes en residencias durante la pandemia.

Tras el funeral, las redes sociales recuperaron antiguos vídeos de Ayuso, especialmente una intervención en el programa ‘El gato al agua’, en la que afirmaba explícitamente no ser creyente. En ese espacio, la entonces joven dirigente explicaba que no acudía a misa ni se relacionaba políticamente en función de creencias religiosas, subrayando que dentro del Partido Popular conviven sensibilidades muy distintas unidas más por valores políticos generales que por convicciones personale]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resurgen-declaraciones-pasadas-de-ayuso-sobre-su-falta-de-creencias-tras-la-polemica-del-funeral-en-la-almudena</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resurgen-declaraciones-pasadas-de-ayuso-sobre-su-falta-de-creencias-tras-la-polemica-del-funeral-en-la-almudena</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Óscar Puente defiende su gestión por el accidente de Adamuz en el Senado y rechaza las críticas del PP]]></title><description><![CDATA[El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, ha finalizado su comparecencia en el Senado sobre el accidente de Adamuz con un discurso de defensa de su actuación y de ataque político al Partido Popular y a algunos de sus dirigentes. Puente ha reivindicado que ha asumido sus responsabilidades y que ha estado al frente de la gestión desde el primer momento, asegurando que ha actuado con transparencia y que no tiene nada que ocultar. En ese contexto, ha utilizado una frase muy dura contra sus adversarios al afirmar que nunca se le podrá comparar con quien, según él, se escondía en un restaurante llamado ‘El Ventorro’ mientras informaba a su superior.

El ministro también ha respondido a las peticiones del PP para que no acudiera a funerales católicos por las víctimas celebrados en Huelva y Madrid.

El reglamento plantea obligar a servicios de mensajería y correo electrónico como WhatsApp, Telegram o Signal a detectar y comunicar a las autoridades la posible presencia de material ilegal en los mensajes de los usuarios. Para lograrlo, se propone el uso de sistemas automáticos capaces de analizar textos, imágenes y archivos.

El principal punto de fricción es el método técnico necesario para aplicar estas medidas. Dado que muchas de estas plataformas utilizan cifrado de extremo a extremo, el contenido solo es legible para el emisor y el receptor. El Chat Control introduce la idea del escaneo en el propio dispositivo del usuario, antes de que el mensaje sea cifrado, lo que se conoce como client-side scanning.

La suspensión de los lanzamientos fue aprobada inicialmente en marzo de 2020 para proteger a los inquilinos vulnerables afectados por la caída de ingresos derivada de la crisis del Covid-19, pero la medida se fue prorrogando de forma continuada durante los años posteriores, incluso una vez superada la emergencia sanitaria. Según datos del Observatorio Desca, esta situación dejó a cerca de 58.000 propietarios sin posibilidad de recuperar sus viviendas.

Con el fin de la moratoria, los jueces pueden retomar los procedimientos a instancia de los caseros. No obstante, los plazos y requisitos varían en función de si el propietario es un particular o un gran tenedor. En el caso de los particulares, basta con solicitar al juzgado el levantamiento de la suspensión para que el proceso continúe.

Los autores, aún no identificados, accedieron a las instalaciones mediante la técnica del butrón, abriendo un hueco en la estructura del edificio que les permitió entrar sin ser detectados en el momento. Una vez dentro, sustrajeron aproximadamente 3.600 kilos de Torta del Casar, un queso con Denominación de Origen Protegida (DOP), cuyo valor de mercado se estima en unos 60.000 euros.

El método empleado y la selección precisa del producto indican que los ladrones conocían bien tanto el funcionamiento de la fábrica como la distribución del stock, lo que refuerza la hipótesis policial de que se trata de un grupo organizado y con experiencia en este tipo de delitos.

Esto le permitiría obtener entre 143 y 147 escaños, ganando de seis a diez respecto a la actual composición del Congreso.

El PSOE se mantiene estancado en un 27%, apenas una décima menos que la semana previa, pero casi cinco puntos por debajo de los resultados de 2023, lo que implicaría una pérdida de entre 12 y 16 escaños (105-109 en total).

Según relata la afectada, alguien accedió de forma clandestina a la parcela de Coiro donde pastaban su caballo y su yegua, y con un objeto cortante afilado seccionó dos tendones y medio de la yegua, causándole heridas mortales. A pesar de los esfuerzos veterinarios por salvarla, el animal tuvo que ser sacrificado debido a la gravedad de las lesiones.

La propietaria, una apasionada de los caballos que los trata como miembros de la familia, está convencida de que el acto fue intencionado y dirigido personalmente contra ella para causarle daño.

Según la Ordenanza de Movilidad de Madrid, los vehículos que no superan los 40 km/h no requieren permisos especiales, lo que ha permitido su expansión sin controles estrictos.

Uno de los aspectos más criticados es la introducción del silencio administrativo negativo. El decreto establece que, si no hay una resolución expresa en seis meses, la solicitud se considerará desestimada.

A raíz de este incidente, la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA) de Estados Unidos ordenó la inmovilización de todos los MD-11 y DC-10, sus predecesores.

Estas cifras se refieren a muertes directas por ataques militares y no incluyen desaparecidos bajo los escombros ni fallecimientos derivados de hambre, frío, enfermedades o el colapso del sistema sanitario.

En este último ámbito, las detenciones bajaron un 35% respecto al año anterior, lo que apunta a una reducción relevante en ese tipo de criminalidad.

El documento, solicitado por Vox a la Consejería de Interior del Gobierno de Navarra, indica que dos tercios de los delitos registrados en la Comunidad Foral son cometidos por personas extranjeras. También destaca un aumento de detenidos de nacionalidad extranjera, con especial presencia de personas procedentes de Marruecos y, en menor medida, de Argelia, Rumanía, Colombia y Perú. Aun así, España continúa siendo el país con mayor número de detenidos en términos absolutos, con 199, aunque esta cifra supone un 15% menos que en 2024.

Estos comunicadores, a menudo sin rigor periodístico, disparan opiniones extremas y ataques personales contra políticos y otros personajes públicos, priorizando el espectáculo sobre la información veraz. El autor denuncia cómo esta práctica degrada el debate público en España, fomentando la polarización y erosionando la confianza en los medios. Se mencionan ejemplos de programas de tertulia donde se emplean metáforas bélicas para describir enfrentamientos verbales, lo que contribuye a un clima de confrontación constante. Además, se critica la complicidad de las cadenas, que buscan ratings a cualquier precio, incluso sacrificando la objetividad. El texto aboga por un periodismo responsable, basado en hechos y no en provocaciones, y advierte sobre los riesgos para la democracia si persiste esta dinámica.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-los-comunicadores-sensacionalistas-en-los-medios</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-los-comunicadores-sensacionalistas-en-los-medios</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 09:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez responde a Elon Musk tras su crítica a la regularización extraordinaria de medio millón de inmigrantes en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha contestado en la red social X al empresario Elon Musk después de que este mostrara sorpresa ('Wow') ante una publicación que criticaba la regularización extraordinaria de migrantes aprobada por el Ejecutivo español. La publicación original, compartida por Musk, afirmaba que España había legalizado a 500.000 inmigrantes irregulares con el objetivo de 'derrotar a la extrema derecha' y que se trataba de una forma de ingeniería electoral para importar un bloque de votantes afín a la izquierda. Sánchez replicó con ironía: 'Marte puede esperar. La humanidad no', aludiendo a los proyectos de Musk con SpaceX para colonizar el planeta rojo, y priorizando así las necesidades humanas en la Tierra sobre ambiciones espaciales.

La medida en cuestión, aprobada el martes 27 de enero de 2026 mediante Real Decreto tras un pacto entre el Gobierno y Podemos, permite la regularización de aproximadamente 500.000 personas extranjeras en situación irregular.

El saldo negativo de la balanza comercial creció un 94,6 % hasta situarse en 56.800 millones de dólares, lo que supone la mayor variación desde marzo de 1992. Este deterioro se explica principalmente por el incremento de las importaciones, que subieron un 5 % hasta 348.900 millones de dólares.

Dentro de las compras al exterior, destacó el aumento de las importaciones de bienes, especialmente las de bienes de capital, que alcanzaron un máximo histórico tras incrementarse en 7.400 millones de dólares. El Gobierno estadounidense atribuye en parte este comportamiento al auge de la inversión en inteligencia artificial, que ha impulsado la demanda de computadoras y semiconductores procedentes del extranjero.

El instrumento principal del satélite, el Infrared Sounder, permite medir con gran precisión la temperatura y la humedad atmosférica. Gracias a canales infrarrojos de onda larga y media, las imágenes muestran tanto la temperatura de la superficie terrestre como la de la parte superior de las nubes, así como la distribución de la humedad en la atmósfera.

La medida reconocía el derecho a la nacionalidad española, sin obligación de renunciar a la anterior ni de residir en España, a quienes pudieran acreditar su origen sefardí mediante apellidos, documentos históricos o certificados emitidos por comunidades judías o autoridades rabínicas.

En sus declaraciones, Trump aseguró que no quiere que el valor de las casas disminuya para beneficiar a personas que, según él, 'no trabajaron muy duro', y defendió que los dueños de viviendas deben seguir sintiéndose económicamente seguros y prósperos.

El presidente sostuvo que su política busca evitar que se destruya el valor de los inmuebles, al tiempo que prometió facilitar el acceso a la compra mediante la bajada de los tipos de interés hipotecarios. Según Trump, esta combinación permitiría que la gente compre vivienda sin que ello implique una caída generalizada de los precios.

En este contexto surgen iniciativas inmobiliarias que buscan ofrecer alquileres más bajos a cambio de reducir el tamaño de las viviendas. Una de estas propuestas es el modelo de los llamados minipisos, impulsado por el inversor inmobiliario Quique Escrivá, de 47 años, propietario de 20 viviendas de pequeño formato y actualmente en proceso de construcción de otras nueve más.

Estas viviendas, con superficies que oscilan entre los 25 y los 40 metros cuadrados, están diseñadas para una sola persona y priorizan el aprovechamiento del espacio frente a la amplitud.

La denuncia sostiene que las promesas de la plataforma, según las cuales nadie salvo emisor y receptor puede leer los mensajes, serían engañosas. Según la demanda, supuestos denunciantes internos afirman que empleados de Meta podrían solicitar acceso a mensajes de WhatsApp mediante sistemas internos y, una vez aprobado, visualizar contenidos casi en tiempo real y también históricos, sin un paso adicional de descifrado.

Meta ha rechazado tajantemente estas acusaciones. Un portavoz declaró que cualquier afirmación de que los mensajes de WhatsApp no están cifrados es falsa y absurda, y recordó que la aplicación utiliza desde hace años el protocolo Signal para su cifrado de extremo a extremo. Por ahora, la demanda no aporta pruebas técnicas que demuestren la existencia de una puerta trasera criptog]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-demanda-en-ee-uu-acusa-a-whatsapp-de-ofrecer-informacion-enganosa-sobre-su-cifrado-de-extremo-a-extremo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-demanda-en-ee-uu-acusa-a-whatsapp-de-ofrecer-informacion-enganosa-sobre-su-cifrado-de-extremo-a-extremo</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Imbolc: origen celta, significado ritual y su vínculo con la Candelaria cristiana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Imbolc es una antigua festividad del calendario celta que se celebraba en torno al 1 de febrero y marcaba un momento clave del año agrícola: el final simbólico del invierno más duro y el anuncio de la primavera. Su nombre suele relacionarse con la purificación y con la lactancia de las ovejas, un signo claro de renovación y de retorno de la vida a los campos. En las sociedades celtas, Imbolc estaba profundamente ligada a los ciclos de la naturaleza y a la observación del entorno, que guiaban tanto la economía rural como la espiritualidad.

Uno de los elementos centrales de Imbolc era el culto a Brigid, diosa asociada al fuego, la poesía, la curación y la fertilidad. Durante esta festividad se encendían hogueras y velas como símbolos de luz creciente, protección y limpieza espiritual. También eran habituales los rituales de purificación del hogar y de las personas, así como las peticiones de prosperidad para la nueva temporada agrícola.

Según el último Barómetro del Alquiler, el incremento de las rentas en las zonas más tensionadas se ha visto limitado por la incapacidad de los inquilinos para asumir nuevas subidas con sus salarios actuales. La renta media ha alcanzado máximos históricos que chocan directamente con el nivel de solvencia de los hogares.

Los indicadores de esfuerzo financiero sitúan el gasto en vivienda por encima del 40 % de los ingresos netos en grandes capitales como Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia y Málaga, muy por encima del 30 % recomendado por organismos reguladores y el Banco de España. Esta situación ha provocado un bloqueo orgánico del mercado: los propietarios tienen dificultades para encontrar perfiles que superen los filtros de solvencia exigidos por aseguradoras de impago y entidades financieras.

Según el artículo 37 del Estatuto de los Trabajadores, los festivos tienen carácter retribuido y no recuperable. Además, el Real Decreto 2001/1983 señala que, si por razones técnicas u organizativas no puede disfrutarse un festivo o descanso semanal, la empresa debe compensarlo económicamente —con un incremento mínimo del 75%— o con descanso alternativo.

El descubrimiento se ha realizado gracias a observaciones en distintas longitudes de onda que muestran un aumento repentino y sostenido de la radiación emitida desde el núcleo de su galaxia anfitriona. Este tipo de fenómeno indica que el agujero negro ha comenzado de nuevo a alimentarse de materia circundante, probablemente gas interestelar o restos de estrellas cercanas.

Cuando un agujero negro entra en fase activa, la materia que cae hacia él forma un disco de acreción que se calienta hasta alcanzar temperaturas extremas, liberando enormes cantidades de energía en forma de luz visible, rayos X y otras radiaciones. En algunos casos, también se generan potentes chorros relativistas que pueden influir de manera decisiva en la evolución de la galaxia, regulando la formación de nuevas estrellas.

Películas infantiles, cuentos clásicos y comedias románticas transmitieron de forma reiterada la idea de que alcanzar determinados hitos —como encontrar el amor, formar una familia o lograr estabilidad económica— garantizaba una felicidad permanente.

El profesor Tal Ben-Shahar, experto en psicología positiva de la Universidad de Harvard, denomina a esta creencia “la falacia de la llegada”. Se trata de una distorsión cognitiva que lleva a pensar que el malestar desaparecerá una vez alcanzado un objetivo concreto. Según este enfoque, la felicidad se concibe erróneamente como un punto de llegada definitivo, cuando en realidad es un estado emocional cambiante y condicionado por múltiples factores biológicos y psicológicos.

Durante su turno de réplica a los grupos parlamentarios, el ministro aseguró que desde el siniestro ha dormido apenas tres horas diarias debido a la gestión de la crisis y reprochó a la oposición su actitud, afirmando que algunos 'duermen a pierna suelta en cualquier circunstancia'. Con esta comparación quiso subrayar su implicación personal en el seguimiento de las consecuencias del accidente.

Puente explicó también por qué no se desplazó personalmente a Cataluña ante incidencias en el servicio de Rodalies, señalando que envió allí a su equipo directivo —incluyendo al secretario de Estado, y a los presidentes de Adif y Renfe— para intentar resolver los problemas. Según indicó, no era operativo que todos los responsables se trasladaran al mismo lugar al mismo tiempo.

El juzgado había abierto diligencias a raíz de dos denuncias presentadas por exalumnos del colegio Casp de Barcelona, relativas a hechos ocurridos en 1999 y 2004, al considerar inicialmente que podían ser perseguidos penalmente. Sin embargo, el Ministerio Público concluyó que los hechos más recientes ya no son legalmente perseguibles, lo que anticipa el archivo definitivo también del resto de denuncias.

Con esta decisión judicial se cierra la última vía para sentar en el banquillo a Peris, a quien las víctimas describen como una persona manipuladora y con un comportamiento abusivo reiterado. Según los testimonios recopilados, las agresiones habrían afectado a un número indeterminado de niños y niñas tanto en centros educativos de Barcelona como en Cochabamba, Bolivia.

Aunque diversos estudios, como uno del Real Instituto Elcano, muestran que muchos españoles perciben a Alemania como superior en ámbitos como la economía, la ciencia o la calidad democrática, este artículo invierte parcialmente esa percepción en materia de vivienda.

El texto parte de la situación en Berlín, donde la escasez de vivienda asequible se perfila como uno de los grandes temas de debate político de cara a las elecciones estatales. Según las estimaciones citadas, en la capital alemana habría alrededor de 10.000 apartamentos vacacionales ilegales.

La ceremonia estuvo presidida por el obispo de Huelva, Santiago Gómez Sierra, y contó con la asistencia de los Reyes de España, así como de autoridades locales, autonómicas y representantes del Gobierno.

Durante el desarrollo del acto, los informativos de la Cadena SER emitieron una conexión en directo para informar sobre la entrada del cortejo litúrgico. En ese contexto, una locutora protagonizó un lapsus verbal al anunciar erróneamente que “sus majestades los Reyes Magos aún no han entrado”, cuando en realidad se refería a los Reyes de España. El error, emitido en el informativo de las 18:00 horas, fue rápidamente identificado como una confusión involuntaria propia de las retransmisiones en directo.

Una mujer le recrimina además la dificultad de acceder a una vivienda digna, un problema social sobre el que el propio Rufián se ha pronunciado en numerosas ocasiones pidiendo medidas públicas.

En contraste, otras personas que se encontraban en la zona se acercan al dirigente republicano para saludarle, hacerse fotos y afear la actitud de quienes le increpan.

Según López, el Gobierno regional era consciente de que muchas residencias no estaban medicalizadas en ese momento, lo que, a su juicio, hacía especialmente graves las decisiones sobre derivaciones hospitalarias.

Las declaraciones del ministro se producen a raíz de una información publicada por El País que recoge correos electrónicos internos intercambiados en plena crisis sanitaria sobre la situación de las residencias. Estos mensajes, según se ha difundido, reflejarían el conocimiento que tenían altos cargos sobre las limitaciones asistenciales en estos centros.

Según fuentes del Ejecutivo autonómico, se trata de un recurso asistencial que, al menos inicialmente, se dedicará a estos menores y que en el futuro podría usarse para otros perfiles de menores según las necesidades del sistema de protección.

La alcaldesa de Cartes, Lorena Cueto (PSOE), ha mostrado su rechazo a la decisión y ha calificado la medida de “castigo” para el municipio. La regidora sostiene que el Gobierno regional ha actuado de forma unilateral, sin consultar ni negociar con el Ayuntamiento, y critica la falta de transparencia en el proceso.

Según el autor, la clave no estuvo en evitar víctimas, sino en prevenir una escalada que pudiera desestabilizar el sistema energético y financiero global, muy ligado al petróleo y al dólar. A partir de ahí, desarrolla una lectura del orden mundial centrada en infraestructuras, comercio y finanzas, más que en ideologías o principios.

El artículo sostiene que el sistema del petrodólar, nacido en los acuerdos entre EE. UU. y Arabia Saudí en los años setenta, ha sido un pilar de la hegemonía estadounidense, pero muestra fragilidades. Señala hitos como el ataque a instalaciones saudíes en 2019 y la mediación china entre Irán y Arabia Saudí en 2023 como síntomas de un equilibrio más multipolar.

Fresu sostiene que vivimos un momento de “éxito hegemónico absoluto” de las clases dominantes, en el que amplios sectores populares acaban apoyando proyectos políticos que refuerzan su propia subordinación. Este fenómeno, explica, se debe a la combinación de neoliberalismo radical, autoritarismo y manipulación digital, lo que denomina una “subversión reaccionaria del mercado”.

El autor subraya que Gramsci no debe leerse como una figura del pasado, sino como un instrumento analítico útil para comprender y transformar la realidad contemporánea, especialmente en el Sur Global. En este sentido, destaca el caso de Brasil como uno de los espacios donde el pensamiento gramsciano ha sido más fértil, al conectar teoría y praxis para analizar las contradicciones históricas ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gianni-fresu-analiza-la-vigencia-del-pensamiento-de-gramsci-ante-la-crisis-de-hegemonia-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gianni-fresu-analiza-la-vigencia-del-pensamiento-de-gramsci-ante-la-crisis-de-hegemonia-global</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Entidades científicas piden suspender un congreso antivacunas en Ciudad Real por su riesgo para la salud pública en medio del repunte de sarampión]]></title><description><![CDATA[Varias entidades científicas y médicas, como el Círculo Escéptico, la APETP, la Confederación Autismo España y la Asociación Española de Profesionales del Autismo, han denunciado públicamente la organización de un congreso titulado 'Daños por vacunas: autismo, enfermedades raras', programado para el 28 de febrero de 2026 en Ciudad Real.

Según los datos oficiales del registro público de contratos, el precio medio del alquiler en estas zonas ha descendido un 8,6% desde la entrada en vigor de la medida el 30 de julio, situándose en 774 euros en el cuarto trimestre de 2025 frente a los 848 euros registrados en el segundo trimestre del mismo año.

Uno de los aspectos más relevantes del balance es que la reducción de precios no ha venido acompañada de una caída de la oferta. Durante el año pasado se firmaron 4.202 contratos de arrendamiento en los municipios tensionados, una cifra muy similar a los 4.176 contratos formalizados en 2024, lo que indica una estabilidad en el número de viviendas disponibles en alquiler.

Este efecto se produce cuando los salarios aumentan para compensar la inflación, pero los tramos y deducciones del impuesto sobre la renta no se actualizan conforme al encarecimiento del coste de la vida. En términos reales, el contribuyente no es más rico, pero acaba pagando más impuestos.

El texto explica que deflactar el IRPF significa ajustar los límites de los tramos y las deducciones a la inflación para evitar subidas fiscales encubiertas. Cuando esto no ocurre, pequeñas subidas salariales pueden situar al contribuyente en un tramo impositivo superior, incrementando el porcentaje de impuestos que paga por una renta que mantiene el mismo poder adquisitivo.

El siniestro causó 45 fallecidos y más de un centenar de heridos, convirtiéndose en uno de los más graves en la historia reciente del ferrocarril español. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) lidera la investigación, con informes preliminares que apuntan a una fatiga progresiva no detectada en el carril (fabricado en 2023, en una zona de soldadura con tramo antiguo), agravada por el paso acumulado de trenes previos (al menos 147 pasos de rueda y un peso significativo antes de la fractura total).

El pacto fue respaldado mayoritariamente por la plantilla en una asamblea celebrada esta semana, lo que permite recuperar la estabilidad del servicio a partir del viernes 30 de enero.

El acuerdo formalizado entre la empresa y el comité de huelga recoge una serie de medidas orientadas a mejorar las condiciones de trabajo y la seguridad de los empleados.

La presidenta del Cabildo, Rosa Dávila, había culpado en 2024 al PSOE y Cs de la falta de acción en mandatos anteriores y anunció que se retomaría el proyecto con la colaboración del arquitecto, que se niega a entregar los planos a la oposición por considerarlos documentos técnicos no definitivos. La reforma se estima en 24 millones de euros, aunque cálculos previos oscilan entre 2,6 millones y 24 millones según informes de 2017 y 2022. La polémica sobre quién debe asumir los costes persiste, dado que Calatrava responsabiliza a las empresas que ejecutaron la obra original, y el acuerdo con estas compañías no ha resuelto la situación.

Un sevillano de 67 años, con 30 años y cuatro meses cotizados a lo largo de su vida laboral, se encontró con que la Seguridad Social le denegó la pensión contributiva porque no cumplía este requisito, ya que llevaba muchos años en paro sin cotizar al final de su carrera. Tras la denegación, sin explicaciones claras según relata, quedó sin ingresos y llegó a dormir en la calle durante siete meses en condiciones muy duras. Finalmente, recurrió al Defensor del Pueblo y obtuvo una pensión no contributiva de 564 euros mensuales, que apenas le alcanza para pagar una habitación alquilada por 170 euros, dejándole prácticamente nada para subsistir.

Manuel Girón, figura clave de la resistencia antifranquista en el noroeste peninsular, fue dado por muerto hasta en cuatro ocasiones por la Guardia Civil antes de caer definitivamente en agosto de 1951, cuando fue abatido por la espalda por un agente infiltrado en los puentes de Malpaso.

G. Wells. Muy joven empezó a publicar relatos en revistas del género y pronto destacó por una productividad fuera de lo común.

Durante los años 50 se convirtió en un autor extremadamente fecundo, capaz de escribir cientos de relatos y numerosas novelas, a menudo bajo seudónimos y adaptándose a las demandas del mercado. Esa etapa le dio éxito económico, pero también desgaste creativo. A finales de la década abandonó temporalmente la ciencia ficción, dedicándose a libros divulgativos y otros trabajos editoriales.

El túnel de Rubí es una infraestructura clave tanto para la línea R8 de pasajeros como para los trenes de carga del Corredor Mediterráneo, principal vía ferroviaria de enlace con Francia.

Esta medida, que culmina una Iniciativa Legislativa Popular respaldada por más de 600.000 firmas y apoyada inicialmente por casi todos los grupos parlamentarios excepto Vox, busca sacar de la clandestinidad a personas ya integradas en la sociedad y la economía española, principalmente de origen latinoamericano.

Se recuerda que no es una novedad: gobiernos anteriores, como el de José María Aznar en 2000 (524.621 personas) y el de José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero en 2005 (576.506), llevaron a cabo procesos similares. El texto destaca que la regularización no es un privilegio, sino un derecho que permite a estas personas acceder a derechos laborales, protección contra abusos y una vida sin miedo constante a la deportación, mejorando así la calidad del empleo y los ingresos fiscales.

La adopción de inteligencia artificial en sectores de servicios avanzados como finanzas, logística, comercio y turismo ha elevado la productividad de la economía.

La principal novedad es la detención de los presuntos autores de los disparos, dos delincuentes españoles conocidos por los alias de ‘el pajarito’ y ‘el moreno’, que supuestamente ofrecían servicios armados a organizaciones criminales a cambio de droga o de pagos que podían alcanzar los 50.000 euros por trabajo.

Según la información policial, uno residía en Mijas y el otro en Marbella, donde había ocupado varias viviendas. En uno de los registros se incautaron 70 kilos de cocaína, armas de fuego municionadas, un visor nocturno, telefonía satelital y un dron, lo que apunta a un alto nivel de preparación logística. En total, durante la fase de explotación se realizaron 13 registros en Sevilla y Málaga y se practicaron 10 detenciones en varios municipios, entre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenidos-los-autores-del-tiroteo-contra-policias-en-isla-mayor-tras-una-macrooperacion-contra-el-narcotrafico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenidos-los-autores-del-tiroteo-contra-policias-en-isla-mayor-tras-una-macrooperacion-contra-el-narcotrafico</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polémicas decisiones del juez Antonio Piña en la Audiencia Nacional y su impacto en casos políticos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza la trayectoria y las primeras decisiones del juez de la Audiencia Nacional Antonio Piña, quien sustituyó a Manuel García Castellón en el Juzgado Central de Instrucción número 6 tras su jubilación.

También menciona un expediente disciplinario abierto en 2015 por presuntas actuaciones fuera de sus competencias, aunque fue archivado posteriormente.

El foco principal está en tres actuaciones recientes consideradas polémicas por el medio. La primera es su papel en causas con implicaciones políticas, donde, según la información, mantendría una línea conservadora similar a la de su predecesor.

Parte de los establecimientos se reconvertirán en supermercados bajo la marca Whole Foods, que Amazon adquirió en 2017, mientras que otros cerrarán definitivamente.

Amazon Go se hizo conocida por su sistema de pago sin cajas, basado en cámaras y sensores que registraban automáticamente los productos que el cliente tomaba y los cargaban a su cuenta.

Para ello, ha reacondicionado un tren de la serie E3 originalmente destinado a pasajeros, retirando sus 394 asientos e instalando suelos antideslizantes y sistemas de sujeción que permitan transportar carga de forma segura. El servicio se orientará a productos de alto valor o sensibles al tiempo, como equipos de precisión y alimentos frescos.

El tren circulará en días laborables acoplado a un convoy de pasajeros de la serie E5 Yamabiko, mientras que las operaciones de carga y descarga se realizarán en depósitos cercanos a las grandes estaciones para no interferir con el flujo de viajeros. La capacidad máxima estimada es de 17,4 toneladas. Además, en los centros logísticos se emplearán vehículos guiados automáticamente (AGV) para agilizar la manipulación de mercancías.

Testimonios de trabajadores, como una técnico en cuidados auxiliares de enfermería, revelan que biberones destinados a bebés prematuros y niños oncológicos llegan sucios, con restos de leche o papilla, afectando a alrededor del 80% de los envíos. En quirófanos, se reportan instrumentos con sangre o restos de hueso, lo que ha obligado a suspender intervenciones o modificar planes quirúrgicos.

En la edición príncipe de 1605, el rucio se pierde en el capítulo 25 y vuelve a aparecer en el 46 sin que el texto ofrezca motivo alguno, una incoherencia narrativa que pronto fue detectada por los lectores. Consciente del fallo, Cervantes intentó corregirlo ese mismo año introduciendo dos pasajes nuevos en una segunda edición: uno que explicaba el robo del burro por un galeote y otro en el que Sancho relataba su recuperación. Sin embargo, esta solución resultó defectuosa, ya que el robo se insertó antes de la última mención previa del animal, generando nuevas contradicciones.

La confusión se agravó con la circulación de distintas ediciones entre 1605 y 1608, de modo que los lectores pudieron acceder a versiones divergentes de una misma obra.

El objetivo principal es fomentar una relación más consciente con la tecnología y combatir los efectos de la hiperconectividad, que según sus promotores tiene un impacto negativo en la salud, la atención y la vida cotidiana.

Como incentivo simbólico, el movimiento calcula que los participantes podrían recuperar unas 54 horas al mes, el tiempo medio que se dedica a hacer uso de plataformas como Instagram, TikTok o similares desde el móvil.

Desde ahí, la IA puede contextualizar la navegación, comparar información procedente de distintos sitios, resumir reseñas extensas o localizar huecos en agendas muy cargadas, todo sin interrumpir la tarea principal.

A raíz de estas discusiones, surgió una pregunta clave: ¿qué ocurriría si el repositorio Git principal de Linus Torvalds desapareciera o dejara de estar accesible?

La respuesta llega en forma de un documento oficial de continuidad elaborado tras la Cumbre de Mantenedores de Linux de 2025. En él se explica que el desarrollo del kernel no depende exclusivamente de una única persona ni de un único repositorio. Actualmente, el proyecto cuenta con más de un centenar de mantenedores que trabajan de manera distribuida en sus propios repositorios, enviando posteriormente los cambios al repositorio principal.

Aunque Linus Torvalds suele encargarse de integrar las contribuciones finales, existen precedentes claros de que otros desarrolladores pueden asumir ese rol.

Aunque los gobiernos suelen presentarlos como motores de crecimiento, con beneficios en PIB, turismo, empleo e imagen internacional, la evidencia empírica entre 2000 y 2024 muestra resultados poco alentadores. En la mayoría de casos, no se observa un impacto macroeconómico significativo ni sostenido. Ejemplos como Brasil con Río 2016 o Rusia 2018 demuestran que ni el crecimiento económico ni el turismo experimentaron mejoras duraderas atribuibles al evento. Los costes, en cambio, son enormes: Qatar 2022 superó los 220.000 millones de dólares y muchos estadios se convierten en 'elefantes blancos', infraestructuras sobredimensionadas, infrautilizadas y caras de mantener, que generan deuda pública a largo plazo.

El plan combina la compra de nuevo material rodante, la rehabilitación de vías existentes y el desarrollo progresivo de líneas de ancho estándar y de alta velocidad.

El sistema ferroviario nigeriano tiene un origen histórico ligado al transporte de mercancías hacia los puertos durante la etapa colonial. Con el tiempo, el Estado asumió el control y consolidó una red nacional que alcanzó su mayor extensión en 1964, al completarse la línea hasta Maiduguri. En la actualidad, el país opera más de 3.500 kilómetros de vía estrecha y cerca de 700 de ancho estándar, reflejando una red en transición tecnológica.

En los últimos años se han puesto en marcha proyectos relevantes, como la línea Abuja–Kaduna en 2016 y Lagos–Ibadan en 2020, ambas con e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nigeria-destina-miles-de-millones-de-nairas-a-renovar-su-red-ferroviaria-y-planificar-alta-velocidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nigeria-destina-miles-de-millones-de-nairas-a-renovar-su-red-ferroviaria-y-planificar-alta-velocidad</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El tipo de empresa marca la gran brecha salarial en el sector tecnológico español]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los salarios en el sector tecnológico español ya no se explican únicamente por el talento, la experiencia o las responsabilidades del profesional, sino principalmente por el tipo de empresa para la que trabaja. Así lo concluye un análisis de la plataforma de empleo Manfred, basado en el modelo propuesto por Gergely Orosz, exjefe de ingeniería de Uber, que describe una distribución “trimodal” de los sueldos tecnológicos.

Este modelo divide el mercado en tres grandes grupos con escaso solapamiento entre ellos. En el primer grupo se encuentran empresas locales y tradicionales, donde la tecnología actúa como un servicio de apoyo. Aquí se incluyen consultoras y grandes corporaciones no digitales, con estructuras jerárquicas y procesos de selección sencillos. Es el grupo con mayor volumen de empleo, pero también con los salarios más bajos, con medias en torno a los 40.000 euros brutos anuales y pocos incentivos variables.

El encuentro, realizado en colaboración con la Universidad de Zaragoza, el Ateneo Stanbrook y el Comisionado 50 años de España en Libertad, buscó compartir experiencias e investigaciones para fomentar una esfera pública más justa y humanista frente al auge de la ultraderecha y los discursos de odio.

La inauguración contó con intervenciones institucionales de Yayo Herrero, Eliseo Serrano Martín, Carmina Gustrán, Pastora Filigrana y Vanesa Jiménez. Se presentó la encuesta ‘Los mapas del odio’, realizada por 40dB, que revela que la mitad de la población española admite odiar a algún colectivo, destacando el odio como un fenómeno social significativo.

El recurso había sido impulsado por la asociación Abogados Cristianos, que actúa como defensa del padre y que, tras conocer la decisión del alto tribunal, ha anunciado su intención de acudir al Tribunal Constitucional e incluso a instancias europeas si fuera necesario.

En su auto, la Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Supremo concluye que el recurso no justifica adecuadamente la existencia de un interés casacional objetivo que permita revisar el caso.

Formado en la Escuela de Arquitectura de Madrid, colaboró con Joaquín Otamendi en obras emblemáticas como el Palacio de Comunicaciones (hoy Palacio de Cibeles, sede del Ayuntamiento), construido entre 1907 y 1919 en estilo neoplateresco con elementos modernos de hierro y vidrio. Otro hito es el Círculo de Bellas Artes (años veinte), con su fachada clasicista monumental y espacios interiores diseñados para la sociabilidad cultural, incluyendo teatro, cine y biblioteca. También destaca el Hospital de Jornaleros de Maudes (1916), un ejemplo de arquitectura social con pabellones abiertos a jardines y avances tecnológicos para la beneficencia obrera.

El pacto, descrito como altamente competitivo, otorga a Sanderson un nivel de control creativo excepcional sobre las adaptaciones, muy por encima de lo habitual en la industria. El autor no solo participará como productor y consultor, sino que actuará como arquitecto del universo, con capacidad de aprobación sobre los proyectos y una implicación directa en los guiones.

Según las informaciones publicadas por The Hollywood Reporter, los primeros títulos que se barajan para su adaptación son la saga ‘Nacidos de la bruma’, pensada para el formato cinematográfico, y ‘El archivo de las tormentas’, concebida como una serie de televisión y que ya cuenta con productores asociados.

Jaenada defiende con firmeza sus convicciones antifascistas y asegura que 'el artista de derechas no existe', ya que el arte requiere empatía y sensibilidad, cualidades que asocia a la izquierda.

A pesar del incidente, Omar rechazó atención médica adicional y continuó con su intervención pública, pidiendo no dar protagonismo al atacante.

El hermano menor de Kazmierczak, en declaraciones exclusivas a The Independent, lo describió como un extremista de derecha con problemas de ira de larga duración y un profundo odio hacia la comunidad somalí, al que atribuye una obsesión prolongada con Ilhan Omar.

Destaca su fuerte rechazo a la presencia de las cámaras y micrófonos de Netflix durante el Tour de Francia, considerándolos invasivos: se colaban en el autobús del equipo, capturaban momentos de frustración tras las etapas y, según él, sacaban situaciones de contexto para crear narrativas sensacionalistas, como un clip donde parecía que el jefe le gritaba sin mostrar el acuerdo previo de que pararía. Aunque los equipos recibían dinero por permitirlo y tenían cierto control editorial, O’Connor cree que se priorizaba el espectáculo sobre la realidad.

El autor denuncia que, desde hace décadas, las políticas ferroviarias han priorizado la alta velocidad y un diseño radial centrado en Madrid, en detrimento de las líneas tradicionales que conectaban pueblos y ciudades intermedias. Como ejemplo simbólico, recuerda el cierre en 1984 de la Ruta de la Plata, que unía Gijón y Sevilla y articulaba el noroeste peninsular, sacrificada por un modelo que apostaba por grandes infraestructuras más vistosas y rentables políticamente.

Según el texto, este enfoque ha sido compartido por gobiernos de distinto signo y ha generado enormes costes económicos, tanto en construcción como en mantenimiento, además de oportunidades de corrupción ligadas a expropiaciones y sobrecostes.

Dope, procedente de un entorno marginal, superó una adicción a la pasta base gracias al Hip Hop político y la educación popular, convirtiéndose en un ejemplo de transformación personal y compromiso comunitario. Participó en talleres, festivales y grabaciones, inspirando al autor en su propio activismo en España con el proyecto Rompe el Círculo. Años después, Dope recayó en las drogas tras una depresión y vivió en situación de calle, pero mantuvo su bondad y reciprocidad.

Después de años siendo una pieza clave en equipos como Quick-Step y Lidl-Trek, el belga reflexiona con honestidad sobre los sueños, los límites y la evolución del ciclismo de élite. Reconoce que, como casi todos, aspiraba a ser un corredor explosivo capaz de ganar carreras, como Alejandro Valverde o Tom Boonen, pero que con el tiempo entendió qué tipo de ciclista podía ser y cómo aportar valor al equipo desde otro rol.

Desde esa experiencia analiza también el ciclismo actual. Considera que Remco Evenepoel ha dado pasos importantes hacia la general del Tour, aunque todavía necesita un salto extra para competir por la victoria, y sitúa a Tadej Pogačar en una dimensión claramente superior, especialmente en la montaña.

Partiendo de ejemplos de destrucción de bibliotecas en conflictos y de políticas de censura o desinversión, el texto subraya que estas instituciones son depósitos de memoria colectiva y herramientas de acceso democrático al conocimiento. Se retoma la idea del sociólogo Ray Oldenburg del “tercer lugar”: espacios de encuentro distintos del hogar y el trabajo, necesarios para la vida comunitaria.

La Fed decidió mantener sin cambios su tipo de interés clave en el rango del 3,50% al 3,75%, poniendo fin a tres recortes consecutivos de 25 puntos básicos realizados en 2025. Esta decisión contó con dos disidencias de los gobernadores Stephen Miran y Christopher Waller, que preferían un nuevo recorte.

Powell indicó que la inflación en diciembre seguía claramente por encima del objetivo del 2%, con el índice subyacente de gastos de consumo personal (PCE) estimado en torno al 3%. Atribuyó esta elevada lectura principalmente al sector de bienes, impulsado por los efectos de los aranceles impuestos por la administración Trump. En contraste, señaló que la desinflación continúa en el sector servicios. Excluyendo el impacto de los aranceles en los bienes, el PCE subyacente estaría solo ligeramente por encima del 2%, lo que co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fed-mantiene-los-tipos-en-el-3-50-3-75-powell-atribuye-la-inflacion-elevada-principalmente-a-los-aranceles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fed-mantiene-los-tipos-en-el-3-50-3-75-powell-atribuye-la-inflacion-elevada-principalmente-a-los-aranceles</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rescatan sano y salvo en aguas de Argelia al tripulante de un velero desaparecido desde el 15 de enero tras salir de Gandia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre de 69 años, con escasos conocimientos de navegación, partió el 15 de enero desde el puerto de Gandia (Valencia) en el velero 'Admirante' con destino a Guardamar del Segura (Alicante). Poco después, perdió el control de la embarcación al quedarse sin batería en el motor y sin radio, quedando a la deriva. Contactó brevemente con Emergencias 112 indicando su posición aproximada cerca de Benidorm, pero la llamada se cortó al agotarse la batería del móvil. Su esposa denunció la desaparición el 16 de enero ante la Guardia Civil de Gandia, lo que activó un amplio dispositivo de búsqueda coordinado por Salvamento Marítimo, Guardia Civil y Cruz Roja. Durante días se peinaron zonas costeras de Alicante, ampliando el radio hacia el norte y sur, incluso hasta la Región de Murcia, con medios aéreos como el avión Sasemar 308 y avisos a navegantes.

La secuencia, que dura menos de 20 segundos, registra desde el impacto inicial —con destellos, chispas y la pérdida del depósito de combustible externo— hasta la rotura completa del fuselaje y la caída en espiral de las diferentes partes del avión, incluida la sección delantera con la cabina.

El piloto, identificado como Stanislav Rykov, del 299º Regimiento de Aviación Táctica, falleció en el incidente. Rykov era uno de los pilotos de ataque al suelo más experimentados de Ucrania, con 385 salidas de combate registradas. La pérdida ocurrió el 7 de febrero de 2024 cerca de Novotroitske, en la región de Donetsk, según informaciones del Ministerio de Defensa ruso que coinciden en fecha y zona.

Este reconocimiento, el quinto de su categoría, honra su extensa carrera de más de cinco décadas en Hollywood, donde ha destacado por su talento interpretativo y su compromiso con causas sociales. Sarandon, nacida en 1946, comenzó su trayectoria en los años setenta con películas como 'Atlantic City' (1980), que le valió su primera nominación al Oscar. A lo largo de su carrera ha sido nominada en cinco ocasiones a los premios de la Academia, ganando el Oscar a la mejor actriz principal en 1996 por su papel en 'Pena de muerte' (Dead Man Walking). Otros trabajos icónicos incluyen 'Thelma & Louise' (1991), junto a Geena Davis, 'El cliente' (1994), 'Las brujas de Eastwick' (1987) y 'Los búfalos de Durham' (1988), colaborando con directores y actores de renombre co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/susan-sarandon-recibira-el-goya-internacional-2026-por-su-trayectoria-cinematografica-y-compromiso-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/susan-sarandon-recibira-el-goya-internacional-2026-por-su-trayectoria-cinematografica-y-compromiso-social</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICE rechaza liberar a un cuidador principal para que asista al funeral de su hijo discapacitado en Texas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Maher Tarabishi, un hombre jordano de 62 años residente en Estados Unidos desde 1994, fue detenido por ICE el 28 de octubre de 2025 durante una revisión rutinaria en Dallas (Texas).

La empresa obtuvo un beneficio neto de 3.794 millones de dólares (aproximadamente 3.181 millones de euros), lo que supone un descenso del 46,5% respecto al año anterior. Este retroceso se explica principalmente por el aumento de costes, los aranceles impuestos en Estados Unidos, el fin de los incentivos fiscales a la compra de eléctricos en ese país desde septiembre y, especialmente, por una fuerte caída en las ventas en Europa, donde se registraron descensos de hasta el 50% en mercados importantes, parcialmente atribuida al apoyo público de Musk a partidos de ultraderecha.

Los ingresos totales se redujeron un 3%, hasta los 94.827 millones de dólares (79.496 millones de euros).

Según sus palabras y diversos informes militares estadounidenses, los misiles hipersónicos chinos, como el DF-ZF que alcanza Mach 10, podrían destruir la totalidad de la flota de portaaviones estadounidenses en apenas 20 minutos, sin que los sistemas de defensa actuales (Aegis o THAAD) sean capaces de detectarlos o interceptarlos de forma efectiva. Esta ventaja china se basa en avances tecnológicos como vehículos planeadores hipersónicos y sistemas de ataque orbital fraccionado (FOBS), probados desde 2021, que permiten trayectorias impredecibles y evaden radares de alerta temprana.

Lejos de un discurso tecnófobo o de una denuncia abstracta de “lo digital”, el libro se centra en cómo los sistemas de recomendación organizan de forma concreta nuestra experiencia cultural: qué vemos, qué leemos y qué consideramos relevante. Fernández parte de una idea incómoda pero central: hoy ya no es necesaria la censura explícita, basta con que determinados contenidos queden fuera del campo de visión algorítmico para que, de facto, desaparezcan.

El texto contrapone la distopía clásica del control represivo con un escenario más cercano a Un mundo feliz, donde la comodidad, la fluidez y la amabilidad del entorno reducen la fricción y, con ella, la posibilidad de una atención crítica.

Se trata de utensilios prácticamente indestructibles que mejoran con el uso si se cuidan bien, ya que desarrollan una capa antiadherente natural llamada 'seasoning' a base de polimerización de grasas. Son ideales para freír, saltear, hacer a la plancha y cocinar en el horno, ya que retienen muy bien el calor, permiten altas temperaturas y se pueden usar en todo tipo de fuegos (gas, inducción, vitrocerámica). Además, son relativamente económicas y duran generaciones si se mantienen correctamente.

Sin embargo, presentan varias desventajas importantes. Requieren cuidados constantes: hay que crear y preservar esa capa antiadherente evitando estropajos abrasivos, usando poco jabón, secándolas inmediatamente para prevenir la oxidación y engrasándolas después de cada uso.

La propietaria es la Venerable Orden Tercera (VOT), una institución religiosa franciscana que posee más de 300 pisos en el centro de Madrid.

En un auto especialmente duro, el magistrado no solo descarta reabrir la investigación contra la exsecretaria de Organización del PP, sino que también critica con severidad la actuación del PSOE como acusación popular, al considerar que su escrito tenía un carácter injurioso y carecía de fundamento jurídico.

Piña reprocha al PSOE haber acusado tanto al propio instructor como a la Fiscalía de ocultar pruebas incriminatorias, una afirmación que, según el juez, queda desmentida por el propio desarrollo del procedimiento. Los audios en los que se basaba la solicitud de imputación ya estaban incorporados a la causa, habían sido utilizados previamente por la acusación en distintos recursos y fueron analizados sin que se apreciaran indicios penales suficientes para dirigir de nue]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-nacional-descarta-reabrir-la-investigacion-contra-cospedal-y-reprocha-al-psoe-acusaciones-sin-base-probatoria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-nacional-descarta-reabrir-la-investigacion-contra-cospedal-y-reprocha-al-psoe-acusaciones-sin-base-probatoria</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 01:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[¡La SER silenciada!

Ceballós destaca la importancia de la colaboración internacional para abordar los desafíos que enfrenta la región, incluyendo el cambio climático, el aumento del turismo y la explotación de minerales.

Tradicionalmente, los modelos más estudiados de teoría de cuerdas generaban universos con energía negativa o nula (espacios anti-de Sitter), lo que chocaba con nuestra realidad cosmológica de espacio de Sitter positivo.

Los investigadores utilizan el efecto Casimir en las dimensiones extra compactadas en una variedad de Riemann plana de 6D (similar a un toro generalizado), combinado con flujos para equilibrar fuerzas y obtener una energía oscura positiva aunque pequeña (del orden de 10^-15 en unidades de Planck, aún lejos del valor observado de 10^-120, pero en la dirección correcta).

El autor parte de una afirmación incómoda para su propio marco ideológico: la idea de que Carrero Blanco, figura central del franquismo, tenía razón en su obsesión por dotar a España de armamento nuclear como garantía última de independencia nacional. Según el autor, el objetivo no era el belicismo en sí, sino evitar que potencias extranjeras condicionaran el futuro político del país.

La entrada sostiene que el asesinato de Carrero Blanco no fue solo una acción de ETA, sino que contó con la connivencia de intereses estadounidenses, interesados en modelar la Transición española y, sobre todo, en impedir que España accediera a la disuasión nuclear. A partir de ahí, el autor amplía el foco y conecta este episodio histórico con la coyuntura internacional contemporánea, marcada —según su análisis— por una política exterior agresiva de Estados Unido]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-critica-sobre-disuasion-nuclear-soberania-y-geopolitica-espanola</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-critica-sobre-disuasion-nuclear-soberania-y-geopolitica-espanola</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ataque ruso con drones mata a cinco personas en un tren de pasajeros en Járkov]]></title><description><![CDATA[El martes 27 de enero de 2026, un ataque con drones rusos impactó contra un tren de pasajeros en la región ucraniana de Járkov, causando la muerte de cinco personas y dejando dos heridos. Este incidente, ocurrido por la noche, es considerado el más letal de la campaña rusa contra los ferrocarriles ucranianos en los últimos meses. El tren, que conectaba el oeste y centro de Ucrania con la región de Donetsk, transportaba a más de 200 pasajeros, incluyendo mujeres, niños y soldados de permiso. Uno de los vagones se incendió tras el impacto directo de un dron, lo que obligó a una evacuación urgente en medio de un bosque nevado.

En Ucrania, este tren era conocido popularmente como 'el tren de la vida' o 'el tren del amor', ya que permitía a numerosas familias separadas por la guerra reunirse, especialmente mujeres que viajaban a visitar a sus parejas en el frente. En respuesta al ataque, las banderas se izaron a media asta en todas las estaciones del país como muestra de luto.

El ministro de Justicia, Gunnar Strömmer, ha calificado la situación como una 'emergencia' y ha subrayado que detener el uso de niños en redes criminales es una prioridad clave. El Ejecutivo argumenta que las bandas organizadas explotan a menores porque saben que no enfrentan consecuencias penales serias, lo que ha llevado a un aumento significativo de delitos cometidos por sospechosos menores de 15 años, que se han duplicado en la última década según datos del Consejo Nacional para la Prevención del Crimen.

La iniciativa, respaldada por el Partido Popular, socio de gobierno de Vox en el consistorio, apela a la libertad de expresión y defiende que los conflictos políticos deben resolverse por la vía política y no mediante denuncias judiciales, incluso cuando se trate de expresiones consideradas controvertidas o desafortunadas.

La aprobación se produjo sin debate abierto por parte del PP ni de la propia Herrero, que evitó intervenir tras retirar su moción inicial e integrarla como alternativa a las presentadas por Compromís y el Partido Socialista. Esta maniobra parlamentaria permitió sortear la discusión directa sobre su situación judicial y facilitó un apoyo silencioso del PP, que necesita a Vox para mantener la mayoría municipal.

Durante la sesión de fotos y vídeo, Noem sostuvo un fusil M4 carbine cuyo cañón se inclinó hacia la cabeza y el rostro de uno de los agentes a su lado, lo que constituye una violación clara de la regla fundamental de seguridad armamentística conocida como 'muzzle sweep' (barrido del cañón). Esta norma exige mantener siempre el arma apuntando en una dirección segura y nunca hacia personas o elementos que no se pretenda destruir.

Expertos en armas de fuego de Wyoming, como el exagente de la paz y entrenador Frank Groth y el instructor certificado por la NRA Vince Vanata (exmarine y oficial de seguridad en campos de tiro), coincidieron en que esta acción fue imprudente.

El autor sostiene que, más allá del conflicto palestino, Israel habría sido un actor clave —directa o indirectamente— en la destrucción de varios Estados considerados hostiles a sus intereses estratégicos, utilizando a Estados Unidos como principal ejecutor militar y diplomático.

El texto se apoya en declaraciones atribuidas a figuras como el general Wesley Clark y el economista Jeffrey Sachs para argumentar que la lista de países atacados o desestabilizados por Washington tras el 11-S —Irak, Siria, Líbano, Libia, Somalia, Sudán e Irán— respondería principalmente a prioridades de seguridad israelíes, y no a amenazas reales para Estados Unidos.

La decisión, adoptada tras la propuesta de los organizadores Arturo Pérez-Reverte y Jesús Vigorra, se debe a la renuncia de varios participantes clave, entre ellos el coordinador federal de Izquierda Unida Antonio Maíllo, la vicesecretaria general del PSOE-A María Márquez y el escritor David Uclés, entre otros. Estas bajas han alterado sustancialmente el contenido y el equilibrio de voces que siempre ha caracterizado el ciclo, considerado imprescindible para un debate cultural plural y representativo.

Edwin J. Saltzman, ingeniero aeroespacial de la NASA en el Dryden Flight Research Center, tuvo la idea de mejorar su eficiencia mientras iba al trabajo en bicicleta y notaba cómo los camiones le generaban turbulencias: primero lo empujaban hacia un lado y luego lo atraían hacia la carretera debido al flujo de aire y al vacío creado a su paso.

Motivado por esta observación, Saltzman y su equipo utilizaron una furgoneta Ford modificada, recubierta con paneles de aluminio para crear una forma de referencia cuadrada. Realizaron pruebas en carretera (sin túnel de viento) añadiendo tiras para visualizar el flujo de aire y probando diferentes configuraciones: redondeo de esquinas delanteras, carenado de bajos y modificaciones en la parte trasera.

Esta normativa restringe manifestaciones que consideren promoción de la homosexualidad ante menores, permitiendo prohibiciones y uso de reconocimiento facial. Karácsony intentó sortear la prohibición policial clasificándolo como acto municipal, lo que permitió que se celebrara sin incidentes graves y con una participación masiva de entre 100.000 y 300.000 personas, convirtiéndose en una gran manifestación contra las políticas homófobas de Orbán.

El resultado son ingredientes sostenibles que sustituyen al aceite de pescado en piensos para acuicultura y alimentos para mascotas, reduciendo la presión sobre los océanos y la sobrepesca de especies pelágicas pequeñas. El modelo se basa en la economía circular: producción modular y descentralizada cerca de destilerías y clientes, lo que minimiza el transporte y la huella de carbono.

Uno de los aspectos centrales abordados es la precarización y el abaratamiento del trabajo femenino, especialmente visible en actividades como el hilado. Muchas mujeres, conocidas como hilanderas, realizaban este trabajo por encargo desde sus hogares o en entornos rurales dispersos, combinándolo con las labores agrícolas y domésticas. Este modelo de trabajo no concentrado permitió a los sistemas productivos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-trabajo-femenino-rural-y-su-contribucion-silenciosa-al-desarrollo-del-capitalismo-moderno</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-trabajo-femenino-rural-y-su-contribucion-silenciosa-al-desarrollo-del-capitalismo-moderno</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La eurodiputada del BNG solicita a Roberta Metsola la prohibición de la VII Cumbre Transatlántica organizada por la Red Política de Valores en el Parlamento Europeo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La eurodiputada del Bloque Nacionalista Galego (BNG), Ana Miranda, ha enviado una carta formal a la presidenta del Parlamento Europeo, Roberta Metsola, solicitando la prohibición de la VII Cumbre Transatlántica, organizada por la Political Network for Values (Red Política de Valores).

Actualmente se encuentra a la espera de ser deportado, según informó el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), que lo incluyó en su sitio web 'Arrestos: lo peor de lo peor', una lista que destaca a criminales extranjeros considerados de alto riesgo para su expulsión. Su nombre aparece junto a otros 42 chilenos detenidos en operativos recientes.

Fernández Larios huyó a Estados Unidos en 1987 y se declaró culpable en relación con el atentado con coche bomba en Washington D.C. en 1976 que acabó con la vida del ex canciller Orlando Letelier y su secretaria Ronni Moffitt, por lo que cumplió una breve pena y recibió protección federal.

Tras la votación, una mujer del público se levantó y expresó su indignación gritando a los diputados del PP y Vox, calificándolos de “vergüenza”. La presidenta de la Cámara, Francina Armengol, tuvo que expulsar a la manifestante del hemiciclo para poder continuar con la sesión.

Tras esa fecha, estos dispositivos se convertirán en productos 'tontos' sin funcionalidades smart, aunque seguirán encendiendo o apagando manualmente.

La compañía ya había dejado de fabricar la mayoría de estos productos alrededor de 2022 y anunció el fin del soporte en 2025.

Las autoridades chinas han emitido advertencias sobre avistamientos recientes de leopardos de las nieves en la zona, instando a evitar acercarse a los animales y a no caminar solos.

La otra sonda apuntará al frente de choque de la heliosfera, zona ya explorada parcialmente por las Voyager, con despegue en noviembre de 2033 y llegada a la heliopausa en 2053 tras 70 UA, empleando asistencias gravitatorias de la Tierra y Júpiter.

En 2024, la filial Elche Crevillente Salud SAU, que gestiona el hospital del Vinalopó, registró ingresos de 191 millones de euros y un beneficio neto de 11 millones, gracias en parte a un incremento de 40 millones en los pagos de la Generalitat Valenciana tras la ampliación de la concesión por el gobierno del PP. En contraste, Torrejón Salud, que opera el hospital de Torrejón en Madrid, ingresó 123,5 millones (casi todo de la Comunidad de Madrid) pero cerró con pérdidas de 7,9 millones. La diferencia se atribuye a la cápita mucho más alta en Valencia (1.066 euros por paciente) frente a Madrid (581 euros).

El caso se centra en si el tiempo de servicios prestados por un enfermero en el Hospital San Roque Maspalomas, un centro privado concertado, debe valorarse a efectos de carrera profesional al pasar a trabajar en la sanidad pública.

El Alto Tribunal establece como doctrina jurisprudencial que la legislación vigente impide considerar los centros sanitarios privados concertados como integrados en el Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) solo por el hecho del concierto. Por tanto, el tiempo trabajado en ellos no es equiparable al prestado en instituciones públicas, ni siquiera si los servicios se realizaron en el marco del concierto sanitario.

Estos organismos, considerados ancestros remotos de los vertebrados actuales, poseían un sistema visual único compuesto por cuatro ojos: dos grandes laterales y dos centrales más pequeños pero completamente funcionales, con lentes y retinas que contenían melanosomas para absorber la luz, lo que les otorgaba una agudeza visual avanzada para la época del Cámbrico.

El estudio, publicado en la revista Nature, muestra cómo estos ojos centrales acabaron evolucionando hacia la glándula pineal moderna, que en los vertebrados actuales regula los ritmos circadianos mediante la producción de melatonina en respuesta a la luz. Inicialmente capaces de formar imágenes nítidas, estos ojos centrales se redujeron con el tiempo, perdieron su función visual y migraron al interior del cráneo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fosiles-de-peces-con-cuatro-ojos-revelan-la-evolucion-del-sistema-visual-y-la-glandula-pineal-en-vertebrados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fosiles-de-peces-con-cuatro-ojos-revelan-la-evolucion-del-sistema-visual-y-la-glandula-pineal-en-vertebrados</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Monte Athos y sus vetos históricos: avaton, monacato ortodoxo y la huella de la Venganza Catalana]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza uno de los anacronismos más persistentes del continente europeo: el régimen de exclusiones del Monte Athos, una república monástica ortodoxa situada en el norte de Grecia que, desde hace más de mil años, mantiene normas propias al margen de la evolución social europea. Aunque pertenece formalmente al Estado griego, Athos goza de una autonomía reconocida históricamente por imperios, monarquías y, en tiempos recientes, por la Unión Europea.

La base de este sistema es el avaton, una norma vigente desde 1046 cuyo objetivo es preservar la vida ascética de los monjes. Bajo esta lógica se prohibió la entrada de mujeres, sin excepción, al considerarlas una distracción espiritual. Esta exclusión se extendió también a las hembras de animales domésticos, con el fin de evitar cualquier simbolismo asociado a la feminidad, aunque la práctica obligó a introducir excepciones pragmáticas, como gatos o gallinas.

Más singular aún fue la prohibición expresa de entrada a los catalanes]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-monte-athos-y-sus-vetos-historicos-avaton-monacato-ortodoxo-y-la-huella-de-la-venganza-catalana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-monte-athos-y-sus-vetos-historicos-avaton-monacato-ortodoxo-y-la-huella-de-la-venganza-catalana</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alex Vitale analiza la función política y la impunidad de la policía en Estados Unidos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alex Vitale, profesor de Sociología en la Universidad Municipal de Nueva York y autor de 'El final del control policial', analiza la función histórica y contemporánea de la policía en Estados Unidos, destacando que su origen no fue proteger a los ciudadanos, sino controlar la resistencia a la explotación económica y social. Según Vitale, la policía moderna surgió hace 200 años para gestionar conflictos relacionados con el colonialismo, la esclavitud y la industrialización, y hoy actúa en un contexto neoliberal que concentra la riqueza en un pequeño porcentaje de la población, mientras desmantela servicios públicos esenciales. El sociólogo critica la expansión de agencias como el ICE bajo la Administración Trump, que utiliza a agentes federales para perseguir y criminalizar a migrantes y otros grupos vulnerables, creando violencia y abusos sistemáticos.

Esta medida provocó un incremento abrupto de afiliados a la Seguridad Social, elevando la proporción de trabajadores inmigrantes del 6% al 9% en solo tres meses, con mayor impacto en provincias como Alicante, Baleares, Girona, Madrid y Málaga. Según un estudio citado de las Universidades de Barcelona y Copenhague (publicado en 2027), cada migrante legalizado aportó de media 3.504 euros en cotizaciones sociales, lo que supuso un aumento notable en la recaudación, especialmente en sectores como el servicio doméstico (hasta un 100% en algunos casos).

La actriz señala que estas situaciones reflejan un patrón de 'crueldad, inhumanidad y arrogancia' que amenaza los cimientos institucionales del país. Según Close, las instituciones que históricamente estabilizaban la sociedad y protegían a los ciudadanos han sido sistemáticamente debilitadas, y junto con ellas, la confianza pública en la democracia.

Esta pesquisa se basó en el testimonio de un confidente que relató un intercambio disparatado: Urbán cargando la droga a pulso, celebrando la transacción a gritos y afirmando que provenía de Venezuela para financiar a Podemos, e incluso volcándola en la barra del local para que los clientes la consumieran.

El informe se basa en una revisión preliminar de las grabaciones de las cámaras corporales de los agentes y de la documentación oficial de CBP presente en el lugar de los hechos. En ningún momento se afirma que Pretti intentara coger su arma, aunque sí se recoge que, durante el forcejeo, uno de los agentes gritó repetidamente “¡Tiene un arma!” antes de que se produjeran los disparos.

El acero para raíles es uno de los materiales más fiables y regulados, fabricado bajo normas estrictas internacionales que garantizan resistencia a la corrosión, al desgaste y, sobre todo, a las tensiones dinámicas y fatiga provocadas por el paso de trenes a alta velocidad. Los fabricantes cumplen requisitos muy exigentes y los ingenieros aplican amplios márgenes de seguridad, por lo que un fallo catastrófico del material en condiciones normales de servicio es extremadamente improbable.

El foco se desplaza hacia las soldaduras que unen tramos de raíl, realizadas mediante aluminotermia. En este caso, se unieron raíles de distinta antigüedad y posiblemente composición, lo que podría haber generado problemas si la soldadura fue mal ejec]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-tecnico-del-accidente-de-adamuz-el-acero-de-los-railes-no-es-el-responsable-principal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-tecnico-del-accidente-de-adamuz-el-acero-de-los-railes-no-es-el-responsable-principal</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El coste humano internacional de la guerra de Afganistán y el papel real de la OTAN]]></title><description><![CDATA[La guerra de Afganistán, que se prolongó durante veinte años entre 2001 y 2021, tuvo un coste humano mucho más internacional de lo que algunas declaraciones políticas recientes han querido presentar. Según datos recopilados por la base Icasualties, 3.609 militares murieron en acciones de combate durante la intervención, y casi uno de cada tres —1.144 soldados— no pertenecía a Estados Unidos. Estas cifras contradicen abiertamente las afirmaciones del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien llegó a menospreciar el papel de aliados clave como el Reino Unido, insinuando que sus tropas permanecieron alejadas del frente.

Tras las críticas, incluso desde el Gobierno británico, Trump rectificó públicamente, aunque los expertos coinciden en que sus palabras iniciales distorsionan la realidad del conflicto. Países como Reino Unido, Canadá, Francia, Alemania o España participaron activamente en la misión de la OTAN, liderada bajo mandato de la ONU.

Desde su lanzamiento a finales de 2023, se han recuperado cerca de 7.500 millones de envases en menos de dos años, alcanzando tasas de devolución de hasta el 94 % en algunos meses para botellas y latas de plástico, vidrio y metal. El modelo es sencillo: al comprar una bebida, se paga un pequeño depósito (alrededor de 10 céntimos) que se recupera al devolver el envase vacío en máquinas o puntos de recogida distribuidos por todo el país. Este incentivo económico ha convertido el reciclaje en una práctica rentable y accesible, fomentando la participación masiva de la ciudadanía, generando beneficios sociales (como ingresos extra para gastos cotidianos) y creando empleos verdes en logística e infraestructura.

Según el informe, titulado 'Infierno Viviente', los detenidos describen un patrón continuado de violencia física y psicológica, que incluye palizas, descargas eléctricas, uso de gas lacrimógeno y granadas aturdidoras dentro de los centros de detención. Especial gravedad revisten las denuncias de violencia sexual, como amenazas de abuso, golpes en los genitales y casos de penetración anal forzada con objetos, que habrían provocado lesiones permanentes.

Según una investigación citada por CNN, los agentes federales ya conocían a Pretti una semana antes de su muerte, cuando fue reducido violentamente por cinco agentes de ICE tras observar una persecución contra una familia y protestar con un silbato. En ese altercado, uno de los agentes se apoyó sobre su espalda hasta romperle una costilla, lesión que quedó reflejada en su medicación posterior.

El caso se agrava por la existencia de memorandos internos del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) que instan a recopilar imágenes, matrículas y datos personales de manifestantes para crear bases de datos centralizadas.

Esta subida se atribuye a una combinación de factores, incluyendo la presión de la Reserva Federal (Fed), el auge del precio del oro y las sospechas de una posible intervención de Estados Unidos para sostener el yen japonés. La debilidad del dólar, que se encuentra en su peor situación en casi cinco años, es exacerbada por la amenaza de un nuevo cierre del Gobierno en Estados Unidos y la incertidumbre sobre la política económica del país.

'Maus' mantiene su vigencia tras décadas gracias a su forma cercana y desgarradora de narrar los hechos.

Durante su intervención, Bernabé desmintió punto por punto las acusaciones del senador popular Luis Santamaría, quien intentó atribuir al Ejecutivo central responsabilidades como un supuesto 'apagón informativo' de AEMET y la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar. Apoyándose en autos judiciales de la jueza de Catarroja y la Audiencia Provincial, que califican de 'ficción' la teoría del apagón informativo, Bernabé defendió que las previsiones meteorológicas fueron acertadas y oportunas, y que la coordinación de emergencias correspondía a la Generalitat Valenciana bajo el gobierno de Carlos Mazón.

El incidente se ha producido en doce de las trece comarcas sanitarias de Euskadi y ha salido a la luz tras una denuncia de EH Bildu. Según el Departamento de Salud del Gobierno vasco, el error no ha provocado ningún efecto adverso en la salud de los menores afectados, extremo que avalan tanto la Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios como el Consejo Asesor de Vacunas de Euskadi y el propio fabricante.

La vacuna implicada es la hexavalente, que protege frente a seis enfermedades potencialmente graves: difteria, tétanos, tosferina, poliomielitis, hepatitis B y haemophilus influenzae tipo B. Forma parte del calendario oficial de vacunación infantil y se administra a los dos, cuatro y once meses de vida.

En Venezuela, EE.UU. ha buscado controlar los recursos petroleros y derrocar gobiernos contrarios a sus intereses desde 2002, intensificando medidas bajo la administración de Trump, incluyendo bombardeos y bloqueos navales. En Irán, la historia es aún más larga, con intervenciones que comenzaron en 1953 y continuaron con apoyo a Irak en los años 80, bloqueando acuerdos de paz y debilitando al país económica y diplomáticamente.

En España, el 10% de los beneficiarios percibe el 62% del dinero destinado a la PAC, y el 20% superior acumula el 79%. Esta concentración de recursos ha contribuido a la desaparición de numerosas explotaciones agrícolas, especialmente las pequeñas.

Explica que los narcisistas suelen mostrarse inicialmente como personas generosas y adaptadas a las necesidades emocionales de sus víctimas, con el objetivo estratégico de controlarlas y absorberlas emocionalmente. Con el tiempo, aíslan a la persona, erosionan su identidad y generan confusión mediante técnicas como la desviación cognitiva o el abuso invisible.

El uso de sistemas de refuerzo variable, donde las recompensas se entregan de forma imprevisible, activa el sistema de recompensa cerebral y genera liberación de dopamina, reforzando la conducta de apostar incluso ante pérdidas continuas. Además, los sesgos cognitivos, como el sesgo de optimismo o la falacia del jugador, llevan a los jugadores a sobreestimar sus posibilidades de éxito y a interpretar los 'casi aciertos' como señales de que pronto ganarán. La ilusión de control, derivada de pequeñas decisiones en el juego que no afectan el azar real, refuerza la sensación de poder y aumenta la persistencia en la actividad.

La medida consiste en una reducción de medio punto porcentual en el tramo autonómico del IRPF, cuya entrada en vigor está prevista para 2027 y que, según el Gobierno regional, beneficiaría a cerca de 2,9 millones de contribuyentes, principalmente de rentas bajas.

El sindicato sostiene que el debate no debe centrarse únicamente en el atractivo inmediato de pagar menos impuestos, sino en cómo se garantizan los derechos colectivos en una región con crecientes desigualdades sociales. UGT recuerda que el IRPF es una de las principales fuentes de ingresos de las comunidades autónomas y que de su recaudación dependen servicios como la sanidad, la educación, la atención a la dependencia, el transporte público o las políticas de vivienda.

El choque se produjo cuando el presentador planteó preguntas que vinculaban la inmigración irregular con la comisión de delitos graves, una asociación que Belarra calificó de peligrosa y racista.

Desde el inicio del intercambio, Belarra defendió la iniciativa del Gobierno subrayando que la regularización tiene como objetivo garantizar derechos laborales y sociales a cientos de miles de personas que ya viven y trabajan en España, especialmente en sectores como la hostelería, la agricultura o los cuidados.

Desde octubre, al menos siete inmigrantes han muerto en centros de detención repartidos en seis estados de Estados Unidos sin que ICE haya presentado los informes correspondientes dentro del plazo legal. A estos casos se suma el de un inmigrante acusado de tráfico de drogas que murió en febrero del año pasado en Puerto Rico, cuyo informe tampoco fue entregado en tiempo y forma.

La sentencia acredita que la denegación de una prima de 5.000 euros estaba directamente relacionada con la afiliación de la empleada al sindicato CIG (Confederación Intersindical Galega) y su participación en elecciones sindicales. El juzgado considera que la empresa no pudo justificar la negativa a otorgarle la prima, basándose en una evaluación negativa que no pudo ser objetivamente demostrada. Este es el último de una serie de casos en los que Mercadona ha sido condenada por vulneraciones de la libertad sindical en Galicia, incluyendo despidos vinculados a la participación en elecciones sindicales.

En él, acusa al Partido Popular de tomar como “rehenes” a los jubilados por haber votado en contra de la norma en el Congreso, junto a Vox y UPN, y asegura que el Ejecutivo seguirá luchando para garantizar el aumento de estas prestaciones.

El decreto rechazado contemplaba no solo la subida de las pensiones conforme al IPC, sino también la prórroga de la suspensión de los desahucios para colectivos vulnerables y otras medidas sociales, como la congelación de las cuotas de los autónomos. La iniciativa fue finalmente tumbada tras el voto negativo de Junts, socio parlamentario del Gobierno, que había advertido previamente de su rechazo al incluirse en el mismo texto medidas antidesahucio.

El problema surgió porque el pensionista había cotizado desde 1970 hasta su jubilación en 2010, y parte de sus aportaciones antiguas no se pudieron deducir en su momento, lo que provocó que tributara dos veces por la misma renta. Hacienda inicialmente aplicó correcciones parciales, pero rechazó la reducción del 25% que Heraclio reclamaba para las aportaciones realizadas hasta 1998, alegando que las posteriores ya tenían beneficios fiscales. Tras agotar la vía administrativa, el tribunal determinó que la normativa del IRPF busca evitar la doble imposición y que, ante la imposibilidad de acreditar la cuantía exacta de las aportaciones antiguas, corresponde aplicar una reducción fija del 25% sobre la parte de la pensión correspondiente.

El recurso sostiene que, tras la sentencia firme del Supremo dictada en diciembre, no existe margen legal para que García Ortiz continúe ejerciendo funciones dentro del Ministerio Público.

El Tribunal Supremo condenó a García Ortiz a dos años de inhabilitación por un delito de revelación de secretos, al considerar probado que filtró un correo electrónico en el que un comisionista reconocía haber cometido dos delitos fiscales. Dicho mensaje formaba parte de un intento de alcanzar un acuerdo con la Fiscalía para evitar un juicio por fraude fiscal y falsedad documental.

Inicialmente, Fontana afirmó que estos agentes estarían en Italia para proteger al vicepresidente JD Vance y al secretario de Estado Marco Rubio durante la ceremonia de apertura en el estadio de San Siro el 6 de febrero. Posteriormente, la propia región aclaró que no se había confirmado oficialmente la presencia de estos agentes. La confusión ha llevado a que miembros de la oposición soliciten explicaciones al gobierno italiano en el Parlamento. Por su parte, los ministros de Interior y Exteriores han subrayado que la seguridad nacional y el control de las delegaciones extranjeras dependen de las fuerzas italianas, aunque se permite la colaboración de cuerpos de seguridad extranjeros.

El PP exigió inicialmente transparencia y toda la información posible al ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, acusando incluso a una 'ley del silencio'. Sin embargo, tras las numerosas explicaciones y datos facilitados por el ministro en medios de comunicación (sobre el estado de la vía, el carril nuevo instalado en 2025, la hipótesis de fallo en soldadura, etc.), Feijóo se quejó en la COPE de que el Gobierno 'les ha llenado de datos para confundir'. El texto critica esta contradicción: el PP pedía respuestas rápidas antes de que la comisión técnica (CIAF) concluyera, pero rechaza el volumen de información al no poder 'asimilarla'.

A diferencia de otros remakes, esta versión mantiene fielmente la historia y los personajes, evitando cambios significativos tanto en el guion como en lo visual, lo que permite a los fans revivir la esencia de la saga con imágenes impresionantes y de alta calidad. La película narra la historia del joven Hipo, destinado a seguir la tradición vikinga de cazar dragones, que empieza a cuestionar las enseñanzas de su pueblo tras conocer al dragón Desdentao, herido y dócil. Su relación con Desdentao transforma su visión sobre los dragones y desafía la hostilidad heredada de los vikingos.

La historia sigue a cuatro adolescentes —Marcos, José Antonio, Paquito y Toni— que viven un verano lleno de aventuras en bicicleta, mientras crecen en un contexto marcado por la violencia de ETA, la crisis del sida y la proliferación de drogas. La película refleja la dualidad de la época: la inocencia y la alegría de la infancia frente a las dificultades sociales y políticas de los años ochenta. El reparto infantil fue seleccionado entre quinientos niños, mientras que los padres están interpretados por actores como Luis Calleja, Ruth Díaz y Mariam Álvarez. El rodaje se realizó en localizaciones emblemáticas de Euskadi, incluyendo Arrasate, Eibar y Oñate, recreando con detalle la estética de la época, desde la música hasta los decorados, y destacando el ciclismo como un recurso visual y cultural.

La denuncia también afectaba inicialmente al torero Fran Rivera por comentarios similares, aunque este último se retractó posteriormente en una intervención televisiva, argumentando que no se refería directamente a Sánchez ni incitaba a una invasión.

Este movimiento responde a la necesidad de rentabilizar la inversión multimillonaria realizada por Facebook al adquirir WhatsApp en 2014, cuya recuperación ha sido limitada. Aunque WhatsApp Business genera ingresos, mantener la infraestructura global de mensajería sigue siendo muy costoso, por lo que la publicidad se ha vuelto inevitable.

El trabajo se ha centrado en el adenocarcinoma ductal de páncreas, el tipo más frecuente de este cáncer y uno de los más resistentes a los tratamientos actuales. La principal dificultad de esta enfermedad radica en su diagnóstico tardío y en la escasa eficacia de las terapias disponibles, lo que explica sus bajas tasas de supervivencia.

Según el autor, la reacción contra el humorista no nace de una ofensa real, sino de una mentira repetida de forma masiva: que se había burlado de las víctimas de un accidente ferroviario. En realidad, sostiene Tecé, la sátira iba dirigida al periodismo sensacionalista que explota el dolor ajeno para ganar audiencia.

El texto describe cómo esta falsedad fue amplificada en redes sociales por sectores de ultraderecha, que pasaron rápidamente de la supuesta indignación moral a la celebración explícita de la retirada del cómico.

Thao, nacido en un campo de refugiados de Laos y naturalizado estadounidense, fue sacado de su casa con solo un par de calzoncillos y zapatillas, expuesto a temperaturas bajo cero. Su esposa y su nieto de cinco años presenciaron la escena, mientras vecinos intentaban verificar la legalidad de la operación. ICE alegó, sin pruebas, que buscaban a otros individuos y que Thao coincidía con la descripción, a pesar de que no vivía con ellos ni tenía antecedentes penales. Tras casi una hora de interrogatorio y toma de huellas, Thao fue devuelto a su domicilio. La familia denunció la falta de orden judicial y la agresividad de los agentes, mientras que el incidente ha generado un gran impacto emocional en la comunidad Hmong local.

Sus declaraciones llegan después de varias semanas marcadas por el acoso, las amenazas de muerte y un clima de intimidación que, según ella, está vinculado al auge de la violencia de la ultraderecha. La situación alcanzó un punto especialmente grave cuando la tumba de las Trece Rosas apareció vandalizada con pintadas, entre ellas una que decía “Sarah Santaolalla RIP”, hecho que motivó que la tertuliana presentara una denuncia ante la Policía.

En este contexto, Santaolalla ha recibido numerosas muestras de apoyo ciudadano.

El juez Antonio Piña, tras recibir una denuncia de la Asociación Libertad y Justicia por presuntos delitos de homicidio imprudente, ha decidido consultar previamente a la Fiscalía si este tribunal es competente para investigar los hechos.

La cuestión de la competencia es clave, ya que Puente, en su condición de ministro, es aforado. Esto implica que, en caso de apreciarse indicios penales, la causa debería ser asumida por el Tribunal Supremo y no por la Audiencia Nacional. No obstante, el auto judicial señala que los hechos descritos en la denuncia presentan características que permiten presumir la posible existencia de una infracción penal, lo que abre la puerta a una investigación más profunda.

Este descenso histórico se debe a varios factores, como la falta de inversión pública y privada, el impacto de la crisis financiera de 2008 y la desaparición de entidades financieras y promotoras que antes impulsaban la construcción de VPO. Solo un 21% de las viviendas protegidas recientes se construyen directamente con participación pública, mientras que el resto depende de promotores privados. La inversión por habitante en vivienda protegida en España es de apenas 80 euros al año, muy inferior a la media europea de 72 euros y a regiones como País Vasco o Navarra, que destinan 450 euros por persona. Aunque España dispone de suelo suficiente para construir más viviendas, la burocracia y los largos plazos para urbanizarlo ralentizan la construcción, demorando proyectos hasta 10-20 años.

Esto es incorrecto, ya que la regularización no concede la nacionalidad española, requisito imprescindible para votar en elecciones generales.

Sin embargo, la Fuerza Aérea de Estados Unidos (USAF) vio en la cápsula Gemini una oportunidad para fines militares. En 1962 surgió Blue Gemini, un proyecto para realizar hasta seis misiones orbitales con la nave Gemini adaptada, con el fin de adquirir experiencia en órbita baja de cara a la estación espacial militar MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), que más tarde evolucionaría hacia el MOL (Manned Orbiting Laboratory) con un telescopio espía KH-10 DORIAN.

Blue Gemini incluía acoplamientos con etapas Agena, pruebas de unidades de maniobra extravehicular AMU y posibles misiones de reconocimiento de satélites enemigos o despliegue de estructuras.

Según explica, ella y un amigo siguieron durante unos segundos a vehículos sin identificar del ICE, tocando el claxon y usando silbatos para advertir de la presencia de los agentes, una forma de observación comunitaria que consideran amparada por la ley.

La respuesta fue, según su testimonio, desproporcionada y violenta: los agentes rodearon su coche, rociaron gas pimienta en el interior sin previo aviso, rompieron las ventanillas, los sacaron a la fuerza y los arrestaron. O’Keefe describe insultos, burlas y comentarios homófobos por parte de los agentes durante el traslado, así como la negación de derechos básicos como realizar una llamada telefónica o acceder a agua y servicios higiénicos en condiciones dignas.

La serie, basada en un reportaje de Cosmopolitan, narra el trabajo de investigadores que identifican posibles terroristas domésticos en foros y redes de ultraderecha. A pesar de que Chastain defendió mantener el estreno, Apple optó por retrasarlo argumentando una 'reflexión detenida', lo que el autor interpreta como miedo a críticas del entorno republicano.

Según el Gobierno regional, esta reducción supondrá un ahorro aproximado de 500 millones de euros y beneficiará a unos 2,9 millones de contribuyentes, con el 71% de ellos teniendo ingresos por debajo de los 35.000 euros brutos anuales, lo que presentaría como un apoyo principal a las rentas bajas y medias.

Sin embargo, el artículo critica duramente la medida al argumentar que, debido al carácter progresivo del IRPF, una rebaja uniforme en todos los tramos genera un ahorro mucho mayor en términos absolutos para las rentas altas, ya que estas tributan en los tramos superiores y se benefician de la reducción en toda la 'escalera' impositiva.

Según Rutte, esta iniciativa generaría duplicidades con la OTAN y complicaría la coordinación aliada, beneficiando indirectamente a Vladímir Putin, quien 'estaría encantado' con tal división. 'Le deseo suerte a la UE si quiere hacerlo, pero complicaría las cosas', afirmó, instando a centrarse en la complementariedad: la OTAN en capacidades militares y mando, y la UE en resiliencia, industria y financiación. Desestimó el 'pilar europeo' como una expresión vacía y abogó por un enfoque práctico para la seguridad europea. Rutte también abordó las tensiones con Estados Unidos bajo Donald Trump, recordando el apoyo de aliados en Afganistán —por cada dos soldados estadounidenses caídos, uno de un aliado o socio— y el uso del artículo 5 tras el 11-S.

El incidente tuvo un impacto directo en el equipo femenino del Txuri Urdin, club donostiarra que disputaba un encuentro en la instalación. Diez jugadoras del equipo presentaron síntomas compatibles con una intoxicación leve por inhalación de este gas tóxico, como mareos, dolor de cabeza y malestar general. Estos síntomas aparecieron principalmente después de finalizar el partido, y fueron aumentando con el paso de las horas. Varias de las afectadas recibieron atención médica preventiva y seguimiento, aunque ninguna se encontraba en estado grave en el momento de la información inicial. El club activó inmediatamente los protocolos sanitarios y priorizó la salud de las deportistas.

La organización denuncia la complicidad del bloque de investidura, especialmente del PSOE y su candidata Pilar Alegría, en la permanencia de ambos en prisión tras su participación en una protesta antifascista en 2019 frente a un acto de Vox en Zaragoza. Además, recuerdan que los jóvenes han perdido su derecho al voto en estas elecciones. La plataforma señala que no se han realizado avances para derogar la Ley Mordaza ni para impulsar reformas no punitivas del Código Penal, medidas que consideran necesarias para evitar la repetición de casos similares.

La denuncia se apoya en grabaciones realizadas en el interior de las instalaciones, donde se observan codornices hacinadas, presencia de excrementos acumulados, huevos en contacto con suciedad y cadáveres de aves en descomposición, así como animales vivos compartiendo espacio con restos orgánicos. Según ARDE, estas condiciones serían incompatibles con cualquier estándar mínimo de bienestar animal.

El caso resulta especialmente relevante porque la explotación dispone del sello de bienestar animal Welfair y del certificado Free to Fly, lo que ha generado dudas sobre la fiabilidad y el control real de estas certificaciones.

La salida se produce sin que el país haya cumplido con sus obligaciones financieras, dejando impagos al menos 278 millones de dólares en cuotas correspondientes al periodo presupuestario 2024–2025, además de una cantidad indeterminada de fondos voluntarios prometidos.

Aunque el aviso formal de retirada se comunicó hace un año, la desvinculación práctica fue inmediata: la administración Trump cortó relaciones con la OMS desde el primer momento, justificando la decisión por su gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19, el sistema de cuotas y lo que considera un trato indulgente hacia China. A diferencia de su primer intento de salida durante el anterior mandato, que fue revocado por la administración Biden, esta vez el proceso ha culminado sin marcha atrás.

Aunque no se especificó un calendario concreto para este objetivo inicial, el pacto retoma metas anteriores más ambiciosas, como alcanzar 120 GW para 2030 y hasta 300 GW para 2050.

Estas 'alucinaciones liliputienses', término psiquiátrico inspirado en Los viajes de Gulliver, son sorprendentemente consistentes entre los afectados y pueden durar entre 12 y 24 horas, llegando incluso a requerir hospitalización prolongada.

El investigador Colin Domnauer, de la Universidad de Utah, ha estudiado esta especie durante años.

Esta decisión, confirmada por fuentes del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y personas cercanas al caso, representa la señal más clara de que la administración Trump está revisando sus tácticas más agresivas en la campaña de deportaciones masivas. El cambio se produce tras el tiroteo mortal del sábado en Minneapolis, donde agentes bajo el mando de Bovino mataron a Alex Pretti, un enfermero de cuidados intensivos de 37 años que trabajaba con veteranos. Pretti, que portaba legalmente un arma oculta pero no la desenfundó ni atacó a los agentes según los vídeos disponibles, fue desarmado momentos antes de recibir disparos por la espalda.

El presidente ha reaccionado con dureza después de que un juez aceptara estudiar una demanda del Fondo Nacional para la Preservación Histórica destinada a paralizar el proyecto.

Trump ha publicado un largo y airado mensaje en su red social Truth, donde califica la demanda de “ridícula” y asegura que detener ahora las obras sería “devastador” para la Casa Blanca. Defiende que la construcción avanza más rápido de lo previsto, por debajo del presupuesto y sin coste alguno para los contribuyentes, ya que —según afirma— se financia íntegramente con donaciones privadas que superan los 300 millones de dólares. Para el presidente, el nuevo salón será uno de los más grandes y lujosos del mundo y un espacio necesario para grandes eventos de Esta]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-carga-contra-un-juez-por-intentar-frenar-la-construccion-de-un-nuevo-salon-de-baile-en-la-casa-blanca</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-carga-contra-un-juez-por-intentar-frenar-la-construccion-de-un-nuevo-salon-de-baile-en-la-casa-blanca</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICE, ¡Mierda! - Una canción de protesta por Minneapolis]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo es una canción de protesta con un lenguaje explícito dirigida contra la Agencia de Control de Inmigración (ICE) y los eventos que ocurrieron en Minneapolis.

Romero denuncia la dificultad para ahorrar la entrada, que asciende a entre 60.000 y 70.000 euros, una cantidad inalcanzable para muchas familias. La crisis habitacional en España no solo afecta a los jóvenes, sino también a personas con empleo y vida familiar estable, debido a los altos precios de compra, la presión fiscal y la dificultad de ahorro. El testimonio de Romero pone de manifiesto el impacto emocional y social de esta problemática, desmotivando a la población para trabajar y emprender. El experto en hipotecas José Paino, señala que para acceder a una hipoteca se requiere un salario mínimo de 2.500€ mensuales, lo que agrava aún más la situación.

Según la estimación presentada, unas 30.000 personas mueren diariamente por hambre y 8.000 por enfermedades curables, lo que arrojaría un total de aproximadamente 319 millones de muertes durante 23 años. El autor sostiene que estos datos subrayan la desigualdad inherente al capitalismo, donde, a pesar de producir suficiente alimento y medicamentos, millones de personas continúan subnutridas o sin acceso a tratamientos esenciales. El texto también hace comparaciones con estados socialistas, indicando que, salvo casos excepcionales como Somalia y Camboya, estos lograron reducir la pobreza y la desnutrición significativamente.

El autor, que fue diputado durante los gobiernos de Mariano Rajoy, afirma haber registrado cientos de preguntas parlamentarias que revelaron un periodo de recortes y abandono en el ferrocarril entre 2011 y 2017. Destaca datos oficiales del propio Gobierno del PP: triplicación de retrasos graves en AVE, estancamiento de servicios pese a inversiones previas, falta de renovación de flota (cero euros en grandes pedidos durante años), reducción del 30% en mantenimiento de la red convencional y graves problemas en Andalucía, con proyectos paralizados y millones en indemnizaciones por retrasos.

Este dato, publicado por la Encuesta de Población Activa (EPA), viene acompañado además de un récord histórico de empleo, con 22,46 millones de personas ocupadas tras la creación de más de 605.000 puestos de trabajo a lo largo del año.

Aunque la reducción del número de personas desempleadas fue relativamente moderada —algo menos de 120.000—, este comportamiento se explica por el fuerte aumento de la población activa, que rozó los 25 millones de personas. El mercado laboral español no solo es hoy más grande que nunca, sino que también muestra una evolución más estable que en ciclos anteriores, alejándose de las cifras extremas de desempleo que se alcanzaron en 2013, cuando el paro llegó a rozar el 27%.

El estudio pone el foco especialmente en los barrios de Orba y Alfalares, donde los daños visibles en calles, parques e infraestructuras básicas actúan como recordatorios constantes del trauma vivido.

Los datos son contundentes: en los siete meses posteriores a la catástrofe se registraron 932 atenciones psicosociales, con un incremento superior al 620 % respecto a los niveles habituales previos a la emergencia.

Esta represión no solo busca silenciar las protestas y limitar la organización social, sino también agotar económicamente y psicológicamente a los activistas, llevándolos a abandonar la militancia. Gari describe cómo la policía acusa a los manifestantes de agresiones, incluso cuando ellos son quienes sufren la violencia policial, y cómo los juicios están teniendo consecuencias devastadoras, desde multas elevadas hasta la pérdida de permisos de residencia. Se están produciendo juicios por eslóganes considerados “apología del terrorismo”, como “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, que se utiliza para disolver manifestaciones.

A pesar de estos gestos, defiende que sigue cada palabra y que su atención es completa. Este debate sobre su comportamiento llega en un contexto de creciente atención sobre su salud, debido a moretones en las manos y episodios en los que se le ha visto dormitar en eventos públicos.

El Govern de Salvador Illa, presionado por sus socios de legislatura y la oposición, exigió responsabilidades a las empresas públicas, lo que precipitó estas decisiones. García Alemany llevaba apenas 10 meses en el cargo y había asumido la dirección tras su paso por la EMT de València.

Ejemplos como el vídeo viral de Tedesco usando botellas para 'corregir' a Asensio, o las actitudes exhibicionistas de entrenadores como Arteta con altavoces o Amorim defendiendo su idea hasta el ridículo pese a malos resultados, ilustran este 'frikismo': una banalización que simplifica un deporte complejo y lo convierte en performance mediática.

Según el diplomático, durante la denominada Operación Resolución Absoluta, muchos miembros de los cuerpos de seguridad 'no hicieron todo lo que podían' para detener el avance de las fuerzas extranjeras. Además, afirmó que Rusia conoce los nombres de los 'traidores' que huyeron del país y que habían trabajado sistemáticamente para la inteligencia estadounidense mucho antes de la operación.

El agresor irrumpió en la fiesta privada de la Creative Artists Agency y, además de golpear a Frost en la cara, profirió insultos racistas y le dijo que el expresidente Donald Trump lo deportaría. Frost, de 29 años y hijo de inmigrantes cubanos, informó en sus redes sociales que se encuentra bien y agradeció el apoyo recibido, al tiempo que alertó sobre la peligrosidad de este tipo de actos de odio político. La policía arrestó al agresor tras el incidente. La reacción política no se hizo esperar: Hakeem Jeffries, líder de la minoría demócrata en la Cámara de Representantes, condenó la agresión, calificándola de inaceptable y solicitando que se haga justicia.

El vídeo, que se ha viralizado en redes sociales, muestra una animación de un agente disparando al suelo, acompañado de mensajes críticos sobre las políticas migratorias y el uso de la fuerza por parte de los agentes. Este incidente se produce en un contexto de creciente tensión nacional, exacerbada por la muerte de Alex Pretti, un enfermero de 37 años, durante una operación de inmigración en Minneapolis. Las protestas y vigilias en memoria de Pretti, junto con las demandas de investigación y la retirada de agentes federales de la ciudad, han obligado a las autoridades locales a desplegar a la Guardia Nacional.

La iniciativa cuenta con el respaldo del Gobierno y del presidente Emmanuel Macron, y se ha aprobado con 116 votos a favor y 23 en contra, tras un procedimiento de urgencia que pretende aplicarse desde el próximo curso escolar. Si se aprueba definitivamente, Francia se convertiría en el segundo país del mundo, tras Australia, en establecer una restricción de este tipo. El proyecto de ley incluye solo dos artículos que establecen normativas claras sobre el uso del móvil y las redes sociales para menores.

Partiendo de informes de Europa Laica, el texto sostiene que la Iglesia maneja enormes volúmenes de ingresos y gastos con un alto grado de opacidad y que recibe del Estado más de 11.000 millones de euros anuales mediante subvenciones directas, exenciones fiscales y otros beneficios económicos. Esta situación es descrita como un auténtico paraíso fiscal, incompatible con el principio de igualdad ante la ley.

El autor recuerda que la Constitución de 1978 establece que ninguna confesión tendrá carácter estatal, pero subraya que, más de cuatro décadas después, la Iglesia católica mantiene un poder económico muy superior al de otras entidades, además de una posición privilegiada difícil de cuantificar.

Según su metodología, basada en cinco indicadores financieros y administrativos, el 42% de los locales estudiados presentaría indicios compatibles con prácticas de blanqueo de capitales.

Los criterios utilizados incluyen la declaración de volúmenes de negocio sobredimensionados, márgenes brutos anormalmente bajos, la gestión de varias sociedades por una misma persona en sectores considerados de riesgo, cambios frecuentes de encargado y una facturación inferior al volumen de compras.

El episodio se caracteriza por lluvias intensas, fuertes rachas de viento, mala mar y un ambiente inusualmente templado para esta época del año. En el mapa de avisos destaca que prácticamente todas las comunidades presentan algún nivel de alerta, con la excepción parcial de Aragón durante la jornada del martes.

La situación más preocupante se da en Galicia, donde la Aemet ha activado el aviso rojo por precipitaciones muy intensas que podrían dejar acumulados significativos. A estas lluvias se suma el riesgo añadido del deshielo debido a las temperaturas suaves, lo que incrementa la probabilidad de crecidas en ríos y zonas inundables.

El estudio analiza el periodo comprendido entre 2003 y 2022 y se centra específicamente en la evasión fiscal de los contribuyentes, es decir, en la ocultación parcial de ingresos legales, sin incluir la economía sumergida asociada a actividades ilegales como el tráfico de drogas.

Para calcular la denominada brecha fiscal, Fedea compara las rentas declaradas en el IRPF con las cifras de la contabilidad regional. Los resultados muestran que el grado de cumplimiento fiscal ha oscilado entre el 72,2% registrado en 2005 y el 86% alcanzado en 2020. En el último año analizado, 2022, el cumplimiento se situó en el 85,3%, lo que implica que el 14,7% de las rentas no fueron declaradas, equivalente a unos ingresos ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-evasion-fiscal-en-el-irpf-reduce-la-recaudacion-anual-entre-21-000-y-51-000-millones-de-euros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-evasion-fiscal-en-el-irpf-reduce-la-recaudacion-anual-entre-21-000-y-51-000-millones-de-euros</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El mapa de mayor resolución de la materia oscura revela la estructura del universo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un equipo internacional de científicos ha elaborado el mapa más detallado hasta la fecha de la materia oscura del universo utilizando imágenes del telescopio espacial James Webb.

Los resultados indican que las mujeres tienden a encontrar más atractivas a los hombres con una estatura mayor, una relación hombros-cadera más amplia y un pene relativamente más grande, aunque estos atributos ejercen un efecto decreciente al llegar a extremos.

El incidente pone de relieve las tensiones demográficas y la política migratoria del gobierno de Viktor Orbán, así como las actitudes discriminatorias que persisten en la sociedad húngara hacia la comunidad gitana, que ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-hungria-ministro-sugiere-que-gitanos-limpien-banos-por-falta-de-inmigrantes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-hungria-ministro-sugiere-que-gitanos-limpien-banos-por-falta-de-inmigrantes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miles de aficionados devuelven entradas para la Copa Mundial 2026 por protestas y seguridad]]></title><description><![CDATA[Casi 17.000 aficionados han devuelto sus entradas para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol 2026, tras los llamados al boicot difundidos en redes sociales, según informa el portal jordano Roya News. La masiva devolución de entradas, junto con las protestas y críticas relacionadas con la seguridad y cuestiones políticas, ha provocado que la Federación Internacional de Fútbol (FIFA) programe una reunión de emergencia la próxima semana para abordar la situación. Los llamados al boicot también han tenido un impacto en el sector hotelero de las ciudades anfitrionas del torneo y han generado una bajada de precios en el mercado secundario de entradas. Esta edición del Mundial se celebrará del 11 de junio al 19 de julio en Estados Unidos, México y Canadá, e incluirá por primera vez la participación de 48 selecciones nacionales.

Este cierre marca la desaparición de la última conservera histórica del concejo, un sector que durante décadas proporcionó empleo a cientos de familias y contribuyó significativamente a la independencia económica de las mujeres. La industria conservera en Tapia tiene raíces que se remontan al siglo XIX, con firmas como Conservas Pérez Casariego, Terín o Hijos de Carlo Albo, que durante años lideraron la producción y exportación de pescado, incluyendo envíos a Iberoamérica. Albo inició su actividad en la villa en 1935, alquilando naves hasta construir un edificio moderno en 1941, donde comenzó a contratar operarias con salarios diarios entre 4 y 4,80 pesetas.

A pesar de que la Comunidad de Madrid tiene la capacidad legal para intervenir mediante el derecho de tanteo y retracto —un mecanismo que permitiría adquirir las viviendas antes que un tercero y garantizar su permanencia en el parque público—, la administración no lo ha ejercido. El portavoz de vivienda de Más Madrid, Jorge Moruno, denuncia que la excusa oficial para no actuar es que ha expirado el plazo de ocho años de vigencia de la normativa aplicable.

Las declaraciones se producen en un momento de distensión parcial entre Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea, después de que el presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, anunciara la retirada de aranceles a sus aliados europeos y avanzara un principio de acuerdo con la OTAN en relación con el futuro de Groenlandia.

En concreto, entre el 80% y el 85% de las personas de ascendencia asiática portan una alteración en el gen ABCC11, mientras que esta mutación solo aparece en alrededor del 3% de las personas de origen europeo o africano. Este gen desempeña un papel clave en la producción del olor axilar, ya que codifica una proteína implicada en la liberación de lípidos a través de las glándulas sudoríparas apocrinas, localizadas principalmente en las axilas y la entrepierna.

El olor corporal humano no procede directamente del sudor, sino de la acción de las bacterias de la piel, que descomponen estas sustancias grasas y generan compuestos volátiles responsables del olor característico.

El documento contractual indicaba que debía utilizarse la soldadura correspondiente al acero más duro, mientras que la normativa interna de Adif establece que, en estos casos excepcionales, debe emplearse la del acero de menor grado para garantizar una mayor capacidad de absorción de esfuerzos.

Según ha confirmado el gestor ferroviario, los trabajos finalmente se ejecutaron conforme a la norma técnica interna y no siguiendo el criterio erróneo del pliego. Esta circunstancia quedó reflejada en los partes de trabajo de mayo de 2025, que detallan soldaduras de transición entre carriles nuevos R350HT, fabricados en 2023, y carriles R260 procedentes de la infraestructura original de 1992.

Inicialmente, el Ministerio Fiscal había solicitado ocho años de prisión por un delito de retención ilegal agravada, pero retiró la petición al no comparecer la víctima como testigo. La hermana de la joven declaró que ésta no estaba retenida y que podía salir de la casa. Los acusados, de origen paquistaní, defendieron que su intención era ayudar a la joven mediante la lectura de suras del Corán y negaron cualquier uso de violencia. Sin embargo, los agentes que acudieron al lugar encontraron a la joven con heridas y testimonios que indicaban que había sido sujetada a la fuerza durante el ritual. La joven no ejerció la acusación ni solicitó la indemnización que el Ministerio Fiscal reclamaba. La sentencia refleja un caso complejo donde se mezcla]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/padres-y-tio-de-una-joven-reciben-condena-por-exorcismo-tras-su-divorcio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/padres-y-tio-de-una-joven-reciben-condena-por-exorcismo-tras-su-divorcio</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
