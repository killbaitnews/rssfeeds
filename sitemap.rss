Epstein persistently sought meetings through intermediaries, notably Thorbjørn Jagland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and Council of Europe Secretary General, proposing discussions on Western investment in Russia, economic solutions, geopolitics, or private dinners. Emails show Epstein following up over years, sometimes referencing current events like the MH17 crash to adjust timing, but there is no evidence of any positive response from Russian authorities, no direct communication with Putin, no meetings, and no Kremlin involvement. The Kremlin has denied receiving any such offers. The article critiques Western media outlets for hyping these findings into sensational claims—such as Epstein having 'direct access' to the Kremlin, cryptic ties, or working as a Russian informant (e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-s-unsuccessful-attempts-to-arrange-meetings-with-putin-revealed-in-documents</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-s-unsuccessful-attempts-to-arrange-meetings-with-putin-revealed-in-documents</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Britney Spears Expresses Fear of Her Family and Gratitude for Surviving Past Treatment in New Instagram Post]]></title><description><![CDATA[On February 4, 2026, Britney Spears shared a deeply personal Instagram post reflecting on themes of connection, isolation, and family trauma. The 44-year-old singer emphasized that humans fundamentally seek to avoid loneliness and criticized the idea that isolating someone is a form of help, stating that such actions cause irreversible harm even if forgiveness occurs. She wrote that people can forgive but never forget, highlighting the ongoing need for contact and yearning. Spears then made a stark admission about her own experiences, declaring she feels 'incredibly lucky to even be alive' given how her family treated her in the past, and that she is now 'scared' of them. She described this as part of God's mysterious ways and questioned what message might be conveyed today, while asserting that her family will never accept responsibility for their actions.

The couple announced their engagement in August 2025 after two years of dating. According to sources cited by Us Weekly, Swift is hesitant to invite longtime friend Blake Lively due to concerns that her presence could spark a media frenzy and shift attention away from the couple's special day. This uncertainty arises amid public scrutiny of their friendship, which has cooled significantly. The strain intensified after Lively's legal dispute with It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni led to the unsealing of private text messages between Swift and Lively in court documents. Insiders claim Swift felt 'exposed and violated' by the exposure, creating emotional distance and prompting her to tighten boundaries and become more selective about her inner circle.

Created by Riley Walz, an internet artist and prankster (as described by Wired), and web developer Luke Igel, the project was built quickly as both a technical experiment and a statement on information accessibility. It groups emails into threads, separates sent and received messages, includes a powerful search function for keywords, names, or dates, and organizes contacts in a sidebar, all while relying exclusively on already-public material with no access to private accounts or new data added. The creators emphasize that the goal is not to uncover fresh scandals but to bridge the gap between theoretical public transparency—where records exist ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jmail-project-recreates-gmail-interface-for-public-jeffrey-epstein-emails-to-improve-accessibility</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jmail-project-recreates-gmail-interface-for-public-jeffrey-epstein-emails-to-improve-accessibility</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expiration of the START Treaty Leaves U.S.–Russia Strategic Nuclear Forces Without Legal Limits]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on the expiration of the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), the last remaining bilateral arms control agreement between the United States and Russia governing strategic nuclear weapons. The treaty officially expired after Washington failed to respond to a Russian proposal to extend it for one additional year. Russian officials, including Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, warned that the absence of the treaty places the world in a more dangerous and unstable situation.

START had long been a cornerstone of global nuclear stability, limiting each country to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and establishing verification mechanisms such as mutual inspections and data exchanges. Although Russia suspended its formal participation in 2023 and the United States responded in kind, both sides had continued to respect the limits informally, demonstrating the treaty’s stabilizing effect even amid severe political crise]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/expiration-of-the-start-treaty-leaves-u-s-russia-strategic-nuclear-forces-without-legal-limits</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/expiration-of-the-start-treaty-leaves-u-s-russia-strategic-nuclear-forces-without-legal-limits</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Southwest Offers Limited-Time Companion Pass and Bonus Points on Personal Credit Cards Through Referrals]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frequent Miler reports that referral links for Southwest Rapid Rewards personal credit cards now provide enhanced welcome offers, including a Companion Pass valid through February 28, 2027, plus extra bonus points.

It argues that machines, like buildings or tools, are shaped by assumptions about wear, stress, and repeated use. Rather than treating wear as a failure, the text frames it as an expected and measurable result of sustained operation. Polished surfaces, compressed seals, and shifting tolerances are presented as records of work performed, not signs of neglect.

A central theme is that thoughtful design anticipates where and how wear will occur. Engineers decide which components absorb stress and which remain stable, allowing systems to age in controlled and predictable ways. Longevity, therefore, depends less on preventing change and more on managing it within acceptable boundaries. This perspective shifts attention from avoiding wear to designing systems that can be adjusted, repaired, and realigned over time.

Repair is described as a continuati]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hydraulic-cylinder-repair-and-the-role-of-maintenance-in-long-term-machine-performance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hydraulic-cylinder-repair-and-the-role-of-maintenance-in-long-term-machine-performance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 09:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andreas Lie's Retro-Futuristic Collages Blend 1960s Nostalgia with Surreal Space Scenes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Norwegian artist Andreas Lie creates captivating surreal collages that transport familiar mid-20th-century American scenes into outer space. Using traditional collage methods, he combines vintage imagery of road trips, scenic overlooks, drive-in theaters, and classic automobiles with cosmic backdrops, such as starry voids or roadways hovering above Earth. These pieces evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for an era that never fully materialized in the way retro-futurism once imagined, blending the ordinary with the extraordinary to pull viewers into dreamlike, otherworldly moments. The works draw heavily from 1960s photo album aesthetics, grounding the fantastical elements in recognizable, everyday Americana while placing them in impossible cosmic settings. This contrast immediately disrupts the ordinary and sparks wonder. High-quality prints of these artworks are available for purchase on Andreas Lie’s official website, where fans can explore and acquire them.

Bannon claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would be used to “surround” polling stations during the upcoming November elections, framing the idea as a measure to prevent what he again alleged—without evidence—to be election fraud. His comments immediately triggered widespread concern and criticism from legal experts, politicians, and members of the public, who warned that such actions would amount to voter intimidation and a serious violation of democratic norms.

Social media users reacted strongly, arguing that the presence of federal immigration officers at polling locations would discourage lawful voters, particularly immigrant communities, from participating in elections. Legal analysts cited by the article, including references to the Brennan Center for Justice, emphasized that both federal and state laws ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/steve-bannon-claims-ice-could-be-deployed-near-polling-stations-prompting-legal-and-democratic-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/steve-bannon-claims-ice-could-be-deployed-near-polling-stations-prompting-legal-and-democratic-concerns</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epstein Emails Released: Criticized Trump's Intelligence in Exchanges with Larry Summers, Amid Broader DOJ Document Disclosure]]></title><description><![CDATA[Newly released documents from the U.S. Department of Justice, made public in late January 2026, include email exchanges between disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers discussing President Donald Trump during his first term. In a May 2017 email, Summers questioned Trump's potential involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 election—deeming it plausible but uncertain—and Epstein responded that 'your world does not understand how dumb he really is,' implying a low opinion of Trump's intelligence and suggesting he would blame others for failures. An earlier October 2016 email dismissed speculation about Trump being a cocaine user as having 'zero' plausibility. The releases also feature a proposed but never-filed federal indictment from around 2005-2007, alleging Epstein conspired with three unidentified individuals to recruit underage females (some as young as 14) for sexual acts in exchange for money, with payments and recruitment among girls]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-emails-released-criticized-trump-s-intelligence-in-exchanges-with-larry-summers-amid-broader-doj-document-disclosure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-emails-released-criticized-trump-s-intelligence-in-exchanges-with-larry-summers-amid-broader-doj-document-disclosure</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 06:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeffrey Epstein emails viewed Brexit as start of 'return to tribalism' in correspondence with Peter Thiel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Newly released documents from the US Department of Justice, part of the Jeffrey Epstein files, include emails suggesting that the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein viewed Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union positively. Just days after the Brexit referendum on June 23, 2016, Epstein emailed tech billionaire Peter Thiel on June 26, stating 'Brexit, just the beginning.' When Thiel asked 'Of what,' Epstein replied it signaled a 'return to tribalism, counter to globalisation, amazing new alliances.' He also referenced prior discussions on economic conditions, such as zero interest rates being too high and easier identification of collapsing systems than new opportunities. There is no indication of wrongdoing by Thiel. The release of over three million documents highlights Epstein's extensive connections to influential figures. Another key revelation involves former UK Labour minister Lord Peter Mandelson, accused of forwarding sensitive internal No 10 government emails to Epst]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jeffrey-epstein-emails-viewed-brexit-as-start-of-return-to-tribalism-in-correspondence-with-peter-thiel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jeffrey-epstein-emails-viewed-brexit-as-start-of-return-to-tribalism-in-correspondence-with-peter-thiel</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 06:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Opinionated Critique of Western Power Politics and Media Silence on Syria and Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[This opinion article delivers a harsh and polemical critique of Western political leadership, media control, and foreign interventionism, using a provocative anecdote involving an alleged leaked messaging exchange between U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron. According to the author, Trump publicly shared a screenshot of a private conversation with Macron, an act described as an unprecedented breach of diplomatic discretion. The author argues that the true scandal is not the indiscretion itself, but the lack of substantive media coverage about the content of the exchange.

The piece claims that the conversation implicitly confirms close coordination between the United States and France regarding military and political actions in Syria, contradicting what the author portrays as the dominant media narrative of a purely internal, popular uprising against dictatorship. From this premise, the author expands the argument to suggest that Syria has already been dest]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-opinionated-critique-of-western-power-politics-and-media-silence-on-syria-and-iran</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-opinionated-critique-of-western-power-politics-and-media-silence-on-syria-and-iran</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marjorie Taylor Greene Criticizes House Republicans for Silence on Trump's Attacks Against Thomas Massie]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene publicly criticized fellow House Republicans as 'cowards' and 'weak' for failing to defend Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) against sharp attacks from President Donald Trump. The conflict stems from Trump's Truth Social post on February 2, 2026, where he labeled Massie an 'unreliable' Republican, possibly a RINO, and blamed his recent marriage to Carolyn Moffa (a three-time Trump voter) for supposedly turning him liberal or disloyal. Trump endorsed Massie's primary challenger, Ed Gallrein, a retired Navy SEAL and farmer, highlighting GOP internal divisions over loyalty, policy votes, and issues like the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files. Massie, known for his conservative record and 91% alignment with Trump on votes, has opposed measures such as foreign aid to Israel and full protection of certain Epstein associates.

Speaking on the program Nostalgia Tonight with Joe Sibilia, Jones described a marriage that evolved significantly over time but remained emotionally connected even after it ended. Jim and Jane met while studying puppetry at the University of Maryland and married in 1959, forming both a romantic partnership and the foundation of what would become the Muppets empire.

According to Jones, their early bond was intense and genuine, with Jane playing a critical role in Jim’s creative beginnings. She collaborated closely with him on early projects such as Sam and Friends and was deeply involved in shaping his artistic vision. However, as Jim’s career accelerated and the Muppets became a global success, their relationship dynamic shifted.

Patey, who has no criminal charges, has allowed fellow protesters to use his apartment bathroom or wash off pepper spray, which Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham labeled an 'Antifa safe house.' The designation stems from open-source intelligence, including social media videos where he advocates Antifa principles, and is part of broader DHS efforts using the Intelligence Reporting System - Next Generation (IRS-NG) to track alleged left-wing domestic threats. IRS-NG integrates data from numerous databases, collecting personal details like names, addresses, and SSNs on individuals flagged as domestic terrorists, despite no evidence of organized Antifa networks or crimes by those listed.

The promotion runs from February 3 to March 26, 2026, and requires a minimum purchase of 2,000 points. Not all members receive the same offer: while some accounts are targeted for the full 40% bonus, others may see 35% or different bonus tiers depending on their profile and recent activity.

Although the discounted purchase price is higher than Frequent Miler’s estimated reasonable redemption value for Marriott points, the deal can still make sense in specific scenarios. It is particularly useful for travelers who need a small number of additional points to complete an award booking or who can secure high-value redemptions where points are worth more than one cent each.

According to statements attributed to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will rather than leaving voluntarily. She was last seen on Sunday, February 1, and concerns escalated after law enforcement processed the scene at her residence.

Officials stated that evidence found at the home suggested signs of forced removal, leading them to believe the incident may have occurred during the night while she was asleep. A spokesperson for the sheriff’s department said investigators do not believe she left on her own and emphasized that her limited mobility makes it unlikely she could have walked away without assistance. The circumstances, they said, point to a possible kidnapping or abduction.

Two Colorado coal plant owners, Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and Platte River Power Authority, have filed a petition with the Energy Department, arguing that the government's mandate to keep the Craig Station unit operational past its scheduled closure violates their constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment. The unit was originally set to retire at the end of 2025 due to air pollution regulations, but a mechanical failure and a December order from the administration extended its operation. The Energy Department has defended the move, citing an 'energy emergency' and the need for reliable baseload power.

The piece claims that two complaints triggered the investigation, one of them filed by French MP Éric Bothorel, who reportedly raised concerns about algorithmic manipulation. It further states that the Paris prosecutor’s office has summoned Elon Musk, owner of X, and Linda Yaccarino, who was CEO when the investigation began, to testify on April 20.

He framed the situation with humor while also providing context about how and why his name appeared.

According to Stewart, the reference comes from a 2015 email sent by Epstein to producer Barry Josephson. In the email, Epstein suggested an idea for a hypothetical stand-up project involving filmmaker Woody Allen, proposing that it could be distributed through platforms such as Apple TV or Amazon. Josephson replied by outlining a possible format for the project, describing it as a biographical event that could be hosted or narrated by “somebody like Jon Stewart,” or alternatively voiced over by Allen himself.

His cousin Hamid Gaddafi described him as 'martyred' on Libya Al Ahrar TV, while former Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim condemned the killing as treacherous, noting a recent conversation where Saif expressed hopes for a united and sovereign Libya. Libya's Attorney General opened an investigation, with forensic confirmation of death by gunshot wounds, though perpetrators remain unidentified.

Designed in 1927, approved in 1930, and revised in 1935, the plan remained classified until 1974 and reflected interwar strategic thinking rather than an imminent intention to attack Canada. The plan assumed that the United States would quickly neutralize British forces and occupy key Canadian cities, including Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa, to prevent Britain from using Canada as a staging ground.

According to the article, the plan included detailed operational elements such as seizing ports, disrupting infrastructure, and rapidly occupying population centers.

The move reflects growing concern among European governments about reliance on American technology firms for critical digital infrastructure, particularly in areas involving sensitive government communications and data protection.

French authorities are encouraging the adoption of European-developed alternatives that comply more closely with EU data protection rules, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Officials argue that even when U.S. companies store data on European servers, they may still be subject to American laws that allow U.S. authorities to access data, raising sovereignty and security concerns.

Originally intended to have a smiling expression, the toy ended up with a frown due to a manufacturing error, which has resonated with young workers who identify with its sad appearance. On Chinese social media platforms such as Sina Weibo and RedNote, the toy has become a symbol of the overworked and undervalued, reflecting widespread social fatigue under China's demanding '996' work culture, where employees often work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The phenomenon has sparked memes and posts relating the crying horse to everyday workplace frustrations.

To take advantage of this offer, bookings must be made by February 10, 2026, for travel starting March 7, 2026. Certain routes, including inter-Orkney flights, as well as interline and codeshare flights, are excluded from the promotion. This sale can provide significant value for travelers, especially on routes where cash fares are relatively high. For example, a flight from Aberdeen to Kirkwall in March can cost between £106 and £198 ($145-$271), meaning that redeeming only 3,250 Avios can offer 4.46 to 8.34 cents per point in value.

Rather than treating buildings as sealed, static objects, breathing spaces are designed as dynamic frameworks that interact continuously with nature and human presence. From the moment one enters such a space, subtle elements—shifting daylight, gentle airflow, softened boundaries between indoors and outdoors—create a sense of calm and vitality.

Central to this approach is the rejection of over-containment. Designers prioritize orientation, openness, and the strategic use of natural light as a core material. Daylight is allowed to define rhythm and mood throughout the day, while shadows, reflections, and transparency are embraced instead of tightly controlled. Openings such as large glazed doors, sliding panels, and folding systems become active architectural elements, enabling cross-ventilation, visua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diplomatic Talks Temporarily Delay U.S. Military Action Against Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[Diplomatic efforts between the United States and Iran have led to a temporary postponement of any potential U.S. military strike on Iran.

Feeling protected goes beyond physical safety to include emotional reassurance through stable, predictable environments that allow the nervous system to relax, improving focus and decision-making. Key qualities include clear organization, visual balance, supportive boundaries, and comforting sensory elements like lighting, sound, and texture.

Grounding connects people to the present and their surroundings via natural materials (wood, stone, fabrics), nature-inspired colors, natural light, and outdoor views, reducing anxiety and enhancing belonging.

The test, which simulates fueling and countdown procedures up to T-20 seconds, involved loading approximately 987 tons of cryogenic propellants into the SLS core stage (144 tons of liquid hydrogen and 840 tons of liquid oxygen) and additional propellant into the ICPS upper stage. Although the tanks were successfully filled for the first time in this campaign—a significant improvement over Artemis I—the test was halted multiple times due to persistent hydrogen leaks at the tail service mast umbilicals (TSMU), the same quick-disconnect interfaces at the base of the core stage that caused repeated delays in 2022.

The incident began in June 2025 and involved infrastructure compromise rather than flaws in Notepad++ code itself. Malicious actors redirected certain targeted users to attacker-controlled servers serving malicious update manifests, exploiting weaker update verification in older versions. Multiple independent security researchers attribute the attack to a Chinese state-sponsored group, citing the highly selective targeting typical of espionage campaigns. The shared hosting server was compromised until September 2, 2025, after which attackers retained internal service credentials until December 2, 2025, allowing continued redirection. The hosting provider conducted remediation, including credential rotation, vulnerability fixes, and server migrations, fully blocking attacker access by December 2, 2025.

Rather than using digital manipulation, the project relies entirely on physical alignment, color, and pattern to create the illusion that people and even animals blend seamlessly into their surroundings. Each sweater is custom designed and knitted to precisely match a specific background, such as tiled walls, bus seat upholstery, running tracks, murals, or natural foliage.

Over several years of collaboration, Ford and Dodd have developed a process that combines careful observation with traditional craftsmanship. Dodd studies the chosen location and recreates its visual patterns stitch by stitch, while Ford frames the photograph so the garment aligns perfectly with the background.

It compares modern election strategies to online retail tactics, where voters are segmented into tiny demographic groups and targeted with personalized digital messages to influence behavior, including voting decisions. Unlike traditional methods relying on rallies, posters, or broad TV appeals, Trump's team, under Brad Parscale's 'Proyecto Álamo,' built extensive psychological profiles on 220 million Americans by integrating voter data, purchase histories, gun ownership records, and online activity from sources like Facebook, Experian, and Acxiom. This enabled the creation of over 100,000 unique ad pieces and nearly a billion text messages, with ads tailored to more than 4,000 traits per person based on psychometrics research linking Facebook 'likes' to personality via the OCEAN model.

Michael Mohr, 54, who serves as president of the Central Illinois District of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, was taken into custody on Wednesday and formally charged with one count of producing child pornography.

Investigators say the case emerged after a juvenile reported a disturbing incident to Vandalia police. According to a sworn affidavit, the juvenile stated that they discovered a hidden camera concealed in a hotel bathroom. The report further alleged that Mohr stood over the juvenile and masturbated, prompting law enforcement to begin a broader investigation into his activities.

Search warrants were later executed at properties connected to Mohr in both Springfield and Vandalia.

The article argues that France’s Third Republic (1870–1940), often celebrated as a milestone of democratic freedoms and civic rights, simultaneously consolidated a brutal and explicitly racist colonial system. While republican liberties, secular education, and parliamentary life flourished within metropolitan France, the empire was governed through coercion, legal discrimination, and permanent states of exception.

Poch details how colonial domination was codified through mechanisms such as the Code de l’Indigénat, which denied basic rights to colonized populations and institutionalized forced labor, collective punishment, and racial hierarchy. Prominent republican figures like Jules Ferry embodied this contradiction, defending universal education]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-s-colonial-legacy-and-the-contradictions-of-republican-universalism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-s-colonial-legacy-and-the-contradictions-of-republican-universalism</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU Military Assistance Plans Risk Escalation as the War in Ukraine Deepens]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article argues that the European Union is moving toward a dangerously escalatory path in its approach to the war in Ukraine. It focuses on proposals by Manfred Weber, leader of the European People’s Party, to strengthen and operationalize Article 42.7 of the EU Treaty, the mutual assistance clause that obliges member states to provide aid, including military support, in the event of an attack. According to the author, making this clause more concrete could significantly lower the threshold for EU involvement in armed conflict, especially if Ukraine joins the EU as planned in early 2027 while hostilities with Russia continue.

The text warns that such a move could rapidly draw the EU into war, not only through Ukraine but also through potential flashpoints in the Baltic states or other sensitive regions. It suggests that this may be an intentional strategy to use the assistance clause as a de facto European security guarantee for Eastern Europe, with some voices even proposing Ukrai]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-military-assistance-plans-risk-escalation-as-the-war-in-ukraine-deepens</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-military-assistance-plans-risk-escalation-as-the-war-in-ukraine-deepens</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Human Rights Violations in the Imprisonment of María José Baños Andújar]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article denounces the systematic human rights violations suffered by political prisoner María José Baños Andújar in Spain. At 61 years old, she suffers from multiple serious and chronic health conditions, including advanced HIV, severe malnutrition, cardiovascular and liver problems, and respiratory disorders. Despite her critical health, Spanish prison authorities have denied her access to compassionate release and progression to less restrictive imprisonment, citing only her lack of ideological repentance, without considering medical or security risks. Legal experts from various countries argue that this practice violates the European Convention on Human Rights (CEDH), specifically Articles 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10, which protect the right to life, prohibition of inhuman treatment, private and family life, and freedom of thought and expression.

Romance often involves ambiguity, where people interpret signals inconsistently, leading to anxiety. A single percentage offers reassurance by simplifying complex factors like values, communication styles, emotional safety, life stages, and stress tolerance into one digestible figure. Psychologically, this appeal stems from biases: anchoring makes the initial score shape perceptions of friction; precision bias lends undue credibility to a neat number; and confirmation bias leads people to seek supporting evidence while ignoring contradictions. Most tools, such as name-based love calculators, rely on arbitrary algorithms inspired by numerology or astrology for entertainment rather than accurate measurement of relationship quality.

Key restrictions include that the discount applies solely to the base fare, not to taxes, fees, or additional charges like seat assignments or baggage, which can significantly reduce the overall savings on the total ticket price.

The conviction was for aiding a foreign state (identified as Russia) in activities directed against Latvia and for inciting national hatred and hostility. The charges stem from his 10-minute remote participation in a February 2025 online conference organized by the Moscow-based Institute of CIS Countries, titled 'The Ethnocide of Russian Compatriots in the Baltic States as a Factor in Preparing for War Against Russia.'

Instead, many new recruits report that basic administrative systems have failed to keep pace with the rapid expansion.

Minaj, who has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for around 20 years, previously suggested that the card could expedite her path to citizenship. However, a White House official stated that the card was symbolic and had no impact on her immigration status. Minaj shared the card following her participation in a White House event promoting children’s investment accounts under a Trump-backed initiative, where she was praised by President Trump for her financial contributions and support.

Many factory workers, retirees, and farmers interviewed report that everyday costs such as groceries, utilities, and fuel remain high, undermining expectations that inflation would ease quickly after Trump returned to office.

Mark Baker, a retired factory worker living on Social Security in Waterman, Illinois, explains that limited local shopping options leave residents paying elevated prices for basic items like eggs, milk, and soda. He says incremental price increases make budgeting increasingly difficult, particularly for people on fixed incomes. Baker also expresses disappointment that Trump did not prioritize lowering costs immediately after taking office, which had been a central reason for his vote.

Indigenous communities such as the Inuit, Sámi, and Chukchi had long-established societies adapted to extreme conditions, relying on seasonal hunting, sleds, skin boats, and clothing made from furs and hides. Their knowledge of ice, weather, and wildlife was crucial for survival. Photographers like William Bradford documented these regions and people, producing rare images that capture daily life, whaling activities, icebound ships, and Arctic settlements. European interest in the Arctic evolved from Viking settlements to expeditions driven by trade routes and scientific curiosity. Notable explorers included Sir John Franklin, Fridtjof Nansen, Frederick Cook, Robert Peary, Richard E. Byrd, and Roald Amundsen.

Emails reveal that Epstein discussed potential blackmail and offered intelligence insights to the Kremlin, including information regarding former US President Donald Trump. Epstein's connections may have been facilitated through business dealings with media magnate Robert Maxwell, who was allegedly a Russian asset.

The film, directed by Brett Ratner, follows the First Lady in the lead-up to Donald Trump's second inauguration and premiered with a high-profile event at the Kennedy Center. Despite mixed reviews and competition from films like 'Send Help' and 'Iron Lung' (which grossed $17.9 million), 'Melania' earned approximately $7 million domestically in its opening weekend, surpassing industry expectations of $2-5 million and marking the strongest non-concert documentary opening in over a decade.

In the bit, he posed a mock trivia question comparing the number of tickets sold for a specific Friday afternoon showing at an AMC theater in New York City to the passenger capacity of a Smart car. Panelists Michael Ian Black and Amber Ruffin joined in the humor, guessing even lower figures. Wood Jr. revealed that only 15 tickets were sold for the 3:40 pm showing, while a Smart car can hold up to 20 people, prompting big laughs from the audience. He emphasized the Smart car capacity as '100 percent accurate.' The joke highlighted perceptions of poor turnout despite the film's broader context. The documentary, which chronicles Melania Trump's life and role as First Lady during the transition back to the White House, premiered lavishly at the Kennedy Center.

This marks a dramatic decline from 3.5 million cases across 21 countries when the eradication program began in 1986. The worm is transmitted through contaminated water containing copepods carrying larvae. Once ingested, the parasite migrates through the body and emerges painfully from the skin, typically in the legs or feet, potentially causing severe infections or disability. The remaining human cases in 2025 were reported in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. However, animal infections, particularly in dogs, continue to pose a challenge. Countries reporting animal cases include Chad, Mali, Cameroon, Angola, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. The eradication strategy includes public education on water safety and wound care, cash incentives for reporting cases, and larvicide treatment for water sources.

Reports indicate that Russia has attempted to use Starlink satellite terminals on its drones, extending the range of BM-35 attack drones up to 500 kilometers, threatening the rear of Ukraine. Elon Musk announced that SpaceX has successfully prevented unauthorized use of the Starlink network by Russian forces. The Ukrainian military discovered several Russian drones equipped with Starlink, and the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) confirmed this exploitation. Ukraine promptly contacted SpaceX to address the issue, with CEO Gwynne Shotwell and Elon Musk personally responding.

Cardholders can continue using their existing Barclays cards after this date, with new Citi cards mailed within 6-8 weeks from April 27, 2026. Credit limits, anniversary dates, and initial annual fee assessments remain unchanged, though future fee changes are unclear. A key advantage is the temporary overlap of legacy Barclays benefits and new Citi perks, creating a 'best of both worlds' period until Citi provides advance notice of modifications. Specific transitions include: no-annual-fee Aviator White to Citi AAdvantage MileUp (adding 2X on AA purchases and groceries); Aviator Red ($99 fee) to Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select (adding 2X on gas and dining, with differing $20K spend rewards like a $125 flight discount versus companion certificate); Aviator Silver ($195 fee) to Citi AAdvant]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/barclays-aadvantage-aviator-cards-transition-to-citi-in-april-2026-benefits-changes-and-uncertainties</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/barclays-aadvantage-aviator-cards-transition-to-citi-in-april-2026-benefits-changes-and-uncertainties</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 12:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Billie Eilish's Grammy Speech Sparks Debate About Her LA Home on Ancestral Land]]></title><description><![CDATA[After her politically charged acceptance speech at the 2026 Grammys, Billie Eilish is facing widespread online criticism for owning a Los Angeles mansion built on ancestral land of the Tongva tribe. During her speech for her song 'Wildflower,' Eilish addressed immigration enforcement and the history of colonization in the U.S., stating, 'no one is illegal on stolen land,' and condemned ICE operations. While her remarks received applause inside the venue, social media users highlighted the apparent contradiction of her advocating for migrant rights while living on land once owned by the Tongva people. Commentators suggested she should either return the property or open it to migrants. The Tongva tribe confirmed Eilish's mansion sits on their ancestral land but noted she has not reached out directly. They also expressed appreciation for her raising awareness about indigenous history and collaborated with the Recording Academy for the official Land Acknowledgment during Grammy week.

Currently active promotions include a 15% bonus from Capital One Miles to Avianca LifeMiles (running from January 12 to February 11, 2026), a 30% bonus from Capital One Miles to Japan Airlines Mileage Bank (February 1 to 28, 2026), and a 50% bonus from Chase Ultimate Rewards to Marriott Bonvoy (February 1 to 28, 2026). The post explains that transferable points programs like Capital One, Chase, Amex, Citi, and Bilt offer the best value when combined with bonuses, especially for premium award bookings such as business class flights to Europe, which can cost far fewer miles than cash equivalents.

Buying groups pool purchasing power from many members to acquire large quantities of discounted merchandise or gift cards—items often restricted by per-person limits—then resell them, allowing sellers to offload products to the group after purchase. The process typically involves signing up with a group, monitoring deals via email, Telegram, WhatsApp or similar channels, committing to buy specific items, purchasing with credit cards (often drop-shipped to tax-exempt warehouses), providing tracking, waiting for receipt confirmation (usually 3-5 days), and receiving payment via ACH after a short float period of 2-3 weeks.

Offers range from bonus points per stay, double points after multiple stays, extra elite nights, gift cards, and discounts at specific properties. Many promotions require registration prior to the first qualifying stay, and some are targeted to specific members, making it important for travelers to check eligibility before booking.

Normally, 1,000 Chase points convert to 1,000 Marriott points, but during this promotion, they convert to 1,500 points. While this can increase the number of Marriott points you receive, the overall value may not be optimal for every user. Frequent Miler estimates Chase points are worth approximately 1.5 cents each, and Marriott points about 0.76 cents each. With the bonus, the effective value is around 1.14 cents per Chase point, which is lower than redeeming directly through Chase Travel with the right card. This transfer bonus is most valuable when you have a specific high-value Marriott redemption in mind. Marriott allows a “stay 5, pay 4” benefit for all members, and it’s possible to find award nights where the point value exceeds 1 cent per point, making select redemptions worthwhile.

This option is particularly attractive for businesses seeking to earn credit card rewards, meet large welcome offer spending requirements, or take advantage of big-spend bonuses such as free hotel nights or elite status.

Melio supports a wide range of business expenses, including rent (when paid to a business), utilities, taxes, SaaS subscriptions, professional services, contractors, inventory, and certain loan or mortgage payments when funded by bank transfer.

Zachary Radcliff, 30, is accused of abusing 11 children and faces 60 criminal charges, including 17 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, with the possibility of life imprisonment. The lawsuits claim the church fostered a culture of silence, prioritizing loyalty to the institution over accountability and the safety of its members. Allegations suggest that inappropriate behavior by Zachary Radcliff began when he was a teenager, and some victims were coerced into sending explicit videos in exchange for money.

New cardholders can earn 85,000 Atmos Rewards points plus a companion fare after spending $4,500 within the first 90 days. With a modest $95 annual fee, this promotion positions the card as a strong option for those seeking high-value travel rewards at a relatively low upfront cost.

The bonus alone can be enough for premium travel redemptions, particularly given the strong redemption sweet spots within the Atmos program. For example, travelers based in the northeastern United States may find one-way business class awards to Europe starting at 45,000 points, making it possible to nearly cover a round-trip business class ticket shortly after meeting the minimum spending requirement. Factoring in the points earned from qualifying purchases, cardholders could accumulate close to 90,000 points quickly.

Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies and paramedics responded, providing treatment at the scene before transporting her to a nearby hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Initially described as a medical emergency, the case was transferred to the LASD homicide unit, which is standard protocol for unexpected deaths of young people under unusual or unclear circumstances, rather than an immediate indication of foul play.

The arrest came amid heightened immigration enforcement during the early days of Trump’s renewed immigration crackdown.

The lawsuit cites whistleblower statements claiming that message access can be requested internally and, once approved, viewed in near real time or historically without additional decryption steps. Meta has strongly denied these allegations, stating that WhatsApp has used end-to-end encryption with the Signal protocol for a decade and calling the lawsuit “frivolous.” Importantly, the complaint does not present technical evidence proving any compromise of encryption or a cryptographic backdoor.

The agreement brings together major national and pan-European payment solutions under a shared vision of reducing Europe’s dependence on non-European payment providers while offering consumers and merchants a competitive, homegrown alternative.

The cooperation builds on the existing success of domestic payment systems by connecting them through a central interoperability hub. This hub, to be operated by a jointly established entity, will act as a technical layer allowing transactions to flow seamlessly between national and European solutions, while preserving each solution’s brand, user experience and features.

The project allows participants to interact with a forest environment by speaking or singing into sculptural 'whispering dishes,' which convert their voices into low-frequency vibrations. These vibrations travel through a wooden platform and into the soil, enabling people to experience sound as a physical and ecological phenomenon. Rather than imposing human presence on nature, Forest Mixer integrates humans into the forest's soundscape, highlighting the relationship between humans and the environment. This installation emphasizes the subtle, often unnoticed rhythms of the forest, allowing participants to perceive nature not just visually or audibly, but also physically.

This decision is aimed at preventing the far-right Chega party leader, André Ventura, from winning the presidency. Ventura, who secured nearly a quarter of votes in January's first round, has risen rapidly by campaigning against minority groups, criticizing immigration, and denouncing government corruption. Prominent figures supporting Seguro include former President Aníbal Cavaco Silva, ex-Deputy Prime Minister Paulo Portas, and Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas. Thousands of non-socialist public figures have also signed an open letter backing Seguro, emphasizing a defense of democratic values over party loyalty. While current polls suggest Ventura’s chances of winning are slim, conservatives argue their support for Seguro signals a clear boundary between liberal democratic forces and r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/portuguese-center-right-politicians-endorse-left-wing-candidate-to-block-far-right-leader</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/portuguese-center-right-politicians-endorse-left-wing-candidate-to-block-far-right-leader</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Travel and Airline News Highlights: Hotel Bathroom Design, Airport Security Incidents, Heathrow Liquid Rules, and JetBlue Promotion Costs]]></title><description><![CDATA[This Saturday Selection article from Frequent Miler curates several travel- and aviation-related stories that caught the editors’ attention during the week, even if they did not warrant full standalone coverage. The first topic focuses on a growing controversy in hotel design: bathrooms without proper doors. Many modern hotels have adopted glass walls or open bathroom layouts that compromise privacy, prompting frustration among travelers. The article highlights a grassroots response to this trend through a website called “BringBackDoors.com,” which publicly tracks hotels based on whether they offer adequate bathroom privacy. The author views this trend as impractical and applauds travelers for pushing back against it.

The second story addresses a serious airport security incident at Detroit Metro Airport, where a man drove a Mercedes through the entrance of the McNamara Terminal and into a ticketing area. While the motive remains unclear, the event has raised concerns about insufficie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/travel-and-airline-news-highlights-hotel-bathroom-design-airport-security-incidents-heathrow-liquid-rules-and-jetblue-promotion-costs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/travel-and-airline-news-highlights-hotel-bathroom-design-airport-security-incidents-heathrow-liquid-rules-and-jetblue-promotion-costs</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 22:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Environmental Impact of Non-Biodegradable Wet Wipes]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses the environmental hazards caused by non-biodegradable wet wipes, highlighting recent legislation in the United Kingdom that bans their sale. These wipes, often mistaken for toilet paper, are made from plastic fibers that do not decompose naturally. When flushed down toilets or discarded outdoors, they persist in the environment for decades, contributing to microplastic pollution in soil, rivers, and oceans. The author emphasizes the impracticality of proper disposal in everyday life, as people are unlikely to carry used wipes to a trash bin. The piece calls for other countries to follow the UK's lead in regulating these products, framing the issue as both an ecological concern and a reflection of societal carelessness. The article blends humor and frustration to stress the long-term consequences of ignoring this seemingly minor but pervasive problem.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-environmental-impact-of-non-biodegradable-wet-wipes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-environmental-impact-of-non-biodegradable-wet-wipes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 22:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[From Carolingian Script to Fraktur: The Cultural and Political History of Blackletter Type]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article traces the long and complex history of blackletter typefaces, often misleadingly called “Gothic,” from their medieval origins to their association with German nationalism and Nazism. It begins with Carolingian minuscule, a highly legible script developed in the late 8th century under Charlemagne as part of a broader cultural revival aimed at unifying Christian scholarship across Europe. This script became the ancestor of both modern Roman typefaces and later medieval handwriting styles.

As Europe fragmented after Charlemagne’s empire collapsed, regional styles evolved. In northern France and England, highly angular and dense scripts emerged, mirroring the ornate Gothic architecture of the High Middle Ages. These styles, though unrelated to the ancient Goths, were later labeled “Gothic” by Renaissance humanists in Italy, who viewed them as barbaric deviations from classical Roman ideals. Italian scholars revived and idealized Carolingian scripts, calling them “Antiqua,” and]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/from-carolingian-script-to-fraktur-the-cultural-and-political-history-of-blackletter-type</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/from-carolingian-script-to-fraktur-the-cultural-and-political-history-of-blackletter-type</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 22:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comprehensive Guide to US Credit Cards for Expats and Frequent International Travelers]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article provides a detailed guide on the best US credit cards for expats and international travelers.

It compares these farmer protests with historical demonstrations, such as bishops opposing same-sex marriage, which did not face police suppression. The author criticizes how rural agricultural sectors, heavily subsidized and politically influential, can block major highways for days, disrupting public life, while other groups protesting for social or political causes would face swift repression. The protests are in response to a free trade agreement with Mercosur, which will open European markets to more competition. While European industry is expected to benefit from increased exports, some agricultural sectors, particularly beef farmers, fear losing profits. The article emphasizes that certain sectors, like dairy, pork, and olive oil, will remain competitive or even benefit.

Rehmet, a labor union leader and military veteran, defeated Republican Leigh Wambsganss by over 14 points in the Fort Worth-area district, flipping a traditionally Republican seat. The vacancy occurred after four-term Republican Kelly Hancock resigned to assume another statewide office. National figures reacted to the election results, with the Democratic National Committee framing the win as a warning to Republicans, while former President Trump had publicly supported Wambsganss. Rehmet’s campaign received backing from the DNC and veterans’ group VoteVets, which spent approximately $500,000 on advertising. Although Rehmet now holds the seat, she will serve only until early January and must win the November general election to secure a full term.

The DHS X post encouraged residents to report illegal aliens by calling a dedicated hotline, while providing a link for undocumented individuals to manage their departure. Experts and political commentators reacted strongly, calling the initiative reminiscent of authoritarian practices. Immigration specialist Aaron Reichlin-Melnick described the post as encouraging citizens to report neighbors to gain housing, while journalist Aaron Rupar called it 'straight up Gestapo.' Other commentators, including political candidates and activists, compared the initiative to Nazi-era and Soviet-style informant systems. Senator Scott Wiener criticized the plan as a method to 'collapse the workforce' under the guise of housing affordability.

Focusing on people labeled “long stayers,” the piece highlights that at least 96 individuals have been held in county jail for three years or more without a verdict, and some for nearly a decade or longer. Through detailed reporting and interviews, the story centers on cases such as Vincent Bell and Montrail Brackens, arrested in 2012 and still awaiting trial more than thirteen years later, as well as Marquez Harrison and LaCarla Carr, jailed since 2014 without a trial date.

The article explains how delays are driven by a combination of factors: overburdened public defenders and court-appointed attorneys, a shortage of judges and courtrooms, repeated continuances granted to prosecutors, and institutional dysfunction within San Francisco Superior Court.

Fela, who passed away in 1997, was a trailblazer in creating the Afrobeat genre, blending African rhythms with jazz, funk, and socially conscious lyrics. Known for using his music as a form of protest against political oppression and social injustice in Nigeria and across Africa, Fela's work left a lasting international legacy. His Afrobeat compositions feature extended arrangements, brass sections, and repetitive percussion, influencing musicians globally across jazz, hip-hop, and funk. Notably, this Grammy is an honorary lifetime achievement award, making Fela the first African artist to receive such recognition, distinguishing him from African artists who have won competitive Grammy awards. Fela's life was deeply intertwined with activism, including associations with the Black Panthers during a U.S. tour, establishing the ind]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fela-kuti-receives-posthumous-grammy-honor-for-pioneering-afrobeat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fela-kuti-receives-posthumous-grammy-honor-for-pioneering-afrobeat</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 19:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Antifa groups identify and expose ICE agents involved in abusive practices]]></title><description><![CDATA[A network of antifascist activists, traditionally focused on exposing neo-Nazis and far-right extremists, has shifted attention to U.S. immigration enforcement agencies, particularly ICE and CBP. In Minneapolis, activists from the Pacific Antifascist Research Collective identified a border patrol agent who pepper-sprayed a detained protester, distributing flyers with his name and labeling him a 'suspected kidnapper/terrorist.' The collective, along with other antifascist groups, aims to hold agents accountable for what they consider abusive and violent actions during immigration operations. Activists emphasize that anonymity allows agents to continue harming communities without social consequences. This modern strategy of 'doxing' follows a long American tradition of exposing those who commit violence in secrecy, dating back to anti-lynching campaigns and anti-Klan espionage.

Their release followed a federal judge’s order condemning the administration’s mass deportation efforts as harmful and poorly executed. Images shared by Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro showed Liam wearing a blue cap and Spider-Man backpack, echoing a viral photo taken during his father’s arrest at their Minneapolis home. The family’s detention drew widespread criticism, with lawmakers and neighbors accusing federal officers of traumatizing children and using tactics such as instructing Liam to knock on the door to lure his mother. Court documents cited Bible verses alongside Liam’s image and criticized the administration’s disregard for human and historical principles.

Normally, Capital One miles do not transfer 1:1 to JMB, but with this bonus, 1,000 Capital One miles convert to 975 JMB miles, nearly achieving parity. This promotion is particularly attractive for frequent flyers seeking valuable award bookings. Japan Airlines Mileage Bank allows members to book flights on Japan Airlines, Air France, Emirates, and other carriers, often without excessive surcharges. Additionally, Bilt points transfer 1:1 to JMB, which can be combined with Capital One miles for greater flexibility.

According to the weekly ad, customers are limited to purchasing up to nine gift cards per person per day, although anecdotal reports suggest that some stores may allow higher quantities while others may enforce stricter limits at a manager’s discretion.

This type of promotion is particularly appealing to consumers who use credit cards that earn bonus rewards at office supply stores, such as certain small business or cash-back cards. By purchasing up to nine $200 cards in a single day, a customer could generate as much as $1,800 in qualifying spend without paying activation fees, effectively earning points, miles, or cash back at a lower cost.

The pair allegedly stayed at Estelle Manor, an exclusive country club and luxury hotel in the Cotswolds known for catering to high-profile guests seeking privacy.

Sources quoted in the report described the weekend as highly discreet and romantic. It was claimed that Kardashian and Hamilton were accompanied by security guards throughout their stay to minimize contact with other guests.

This comes after Diggs became a father to four children with four different women within the past year, including a son with Cardi B. Sources reveal that Cardi has clearly communicated that if Diggs were to cheat or have a child without her knowledge, she would end the relationship. Despite these challenges, Cardi reportedly entered the relationship fully aware of Diggs’ reputation and past relationships, trusting him to be faithful since they became official.

The Puerto Rican artist paused before offering traditional thank-yous to deliver a pointed message that criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and called for empathy toward immigrant communities.

Standing before an audience of industry peers, Bad Bunny opened his remarks by declaring 'ICE out,' a statement that immediately drew a strong reaction from the crowd. He then challenged dehumanizing rhetoric often directed at immigrants, emphasizing that they are not criminals or outsiders but human beings who are part of American society. Speaking deliberately, he underscored themes of dignity and belonging, framing immigration as a human issue rather than a political talking point.

While the full text of the agreement is being released gradually, the three governments have described it as a cornerstone of a new international order. The pact builds upon previous bilateral agreements: Iran and Russia's 20-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and Iran and China's 25-year Cooperation Agreement aimed at trade, infrastructure, and energy integration. The new trilateral framework aligns the three countries on issues such as nuclear sovereignty, economic cooperation, military coordination, and diplomatic strategy. Importantly, it does not constitute a binding mutual defense treaty like NATO’s Article 5, but it signals a political coalition united against unilateral military and economic pressures from the West.

The documents, obtained from the US Department of Justice, include email exchanges from 2012 and 2013 where Musk coordinated possible visits with Epstein. Despite multiple plans, including discussions around holiday travel and parties, none of the visits appear to have occurred due to scheduling or logistical conflicts. In response to the circulating emails, Musk’s estranged daughter, Vivian Wilson, shared a memory of childhood trips in the region, recalling boat rides between St. Vincent and St. Barth’s during holiday seasons and the dark night sea she remembered.

Under French law, the seizure was considered illegal, forcing authorities to release the vessel. French President Macron acknowledged in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky that the current legal framework was insufficient and indicated plans to amend domestic legislation to allow future actions against Russian tankers to comply with the law. The tanker had departed from Murmansk, Russia, and although initially claimed to be without a flag, it was actually registered under the Comoros flag.

According to sources cited by Daily Mail, the album reflects a difficult period in Allen's life, including alleged sexual abuse by a powerful music executive and harassment by other industry figures. With the success of her recent album 'West End Girl,' which focused on themes of infidelity and heartbreak, Allen's public profile and influence have grown significantly.

The piece emphasizes that many of these organizations, including the ICHR, HRAI, and UANI, are linked to foreign governments or interests, particularly the United States and Israel, suggesting that the dissemination of inflated figures serves geopolitical and ideological purposes. Examples include unverified stories of protesters hiding in body bags and reports spread by networks of bots.

It describes Hezbollah as an integral extension of Iran's military apparatus, bound by ideological loyalty under the Wilayat al-Faqih doctrine and structural command integration with the IRGC.

The decision stems from repeated breaches of diplomatic protocol, including public statements from Israel's mission insulting South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and failure to notify authorities of visits by senior Israeli officials. This marks a significant escalation in tensions between Pretoria and Tel Aviv, which already have strained relations following South Africa's 2023 complaint against Israel at the International Court of Justice over alleged acts of genocide in Gaza. Israel responded in kind by declaring Shaun Edward Byneveldt, South Africa's top diplomat in Israel, persona non grata with the same 72-hour deadline.

The bench transitions in color from deep marine blues to almost transparent tones, mimicking the effect of sunlight on water. Its design gives the impression of fluid motion, resembling a frozen wave, while remaining fully functional as seating for two people. What sets Cresta apart is its sustainable construction: it is crafted from recycled plastics, including acrylic, PET, and polycarbonate, transforming waste materials into a tactile and visually striking piece of furniture. The vertical textures on the bench scatter light, changing its appearance throughout the day, and occasionally glowing, making it as much a piece of art as a practical object. Cresta demonstrates that eco-friendly design can be bold and aesthetically pleasing, rather than subtle or understated.

While she stopped short of confirming anything concrete, Hilton expressed genuine enthusiasm, describing a collaboration with Spears as a dream scenario and calling it something that would be 'the most iconic thing ever.'

The conversations come at a time when Hilton is actively immersed in music again. She is currently developing her third studio album, following her self-titled debut released in 2006 and her 2024 comeback album, Infinite Icon.

Writing on X, Musk said that his emails had been “misinterpreted” and insisted that he never visited Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean nor traveled on his private aircraft. According to Musk, he repeatedly declined invitations to do so, despite maintaining limited correspondence with Epstein years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for sex crimes involving minors.

The newly released documents contain emails from 2012 and 2013 in which Musk appeared to discuss potential visits to the Caribbean and asked Epstein about parties or suitable dates to meet.

The article states that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard allegedly released a large number of documents connected to the so-called “Russiagate” controversy.

Speaking on Fox Business, Schiff claims that accelerating inflation, growing federal debt, and declining global confidence in the U.S. dollar could lead to a severe financial crisis, potentially worse than the 2008 recession. He suggests that central banks around the world are reducing their holdings of U.S. dollars and Treasury bonds while increasing gold reserves, which he interprets as preparation for a dollar and sovereign debt crisis.

Schiff criticizes the current economic indicators cited by the Trump administration and its supporters, arguing that official data on growth, inflation, and productivity are distorted by inflation and are likely to be revised downward.

Though Musk did not ultimately visit the island due to scheduling conflicts, the exchanges depict a more cordial and friendly rapport between the two men than Musk has publicly admitted.

While the U.S. largely relies on the Imperial system for measurements, efforts to adopt the metric system have been made over the years. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, signed under President Jimmy Carter, aimed to make the metric system the preferred standard for commerce and public works. As part of this initiative, the highway from Tucson to Nogales was built with kilometer-based signage and exit numbering. However, nationwide conversion efforts failed, mainly due to high costs and cultural attachment to the Imperial system. By 1982, President Ronald Reagan officially ended the metric conversion campaign, leaving Interstate 19 as a rare legacy. Local attempts to switch the highway to miles have been unsuccessful, and Arizona maintains parallel mile-based signs for operational purposes, invisible to drivers.

He stated that Pretti did not appear to reach for or use his firearm, yet agents fired multiple shots after disarming him. Huerta Chuma expressed deep guilt and distress over Pretti's death, describing him as a good person and questioning why he was killed.

In total, only around 764,000 vehicles rolled off production lines last year, representing a sharp decline of 15.5% compared with the previous year. This downturn highlights the structural vulnerabilities of the sector and the impact of external shocks on the UK’s industrial base.

Two main factors explain the contraction. The first was the imposition of tariffs by the United States on British-made vehicles. Although these tariffs were eventually reduced from an initial 27.5% to 10%, the bilateral agreement between Washington and London only applies to a quota of 100,000 vehicles per year. This limitation significantly constrained exports and reduced the competitiveness of UK carmakers in one of their key markets.

Witnesses told investigators that the man had been walking along the platform prior to the incident and appeared to be intoxicated.

These sanctions, described as unprecedented in severity, included border closures, the freezing of Malian state assets held at the Central Bank of West African States, and the suspension of commercial and financial transactions. Mali’s transitional government immediately denounced the measures as inhumane and unlawful.

Three years later, the court based in Ouagadougou issued a judgment overturning the sanctions that had been adopted during an extraordinary summit in Accra, Ghana. The judges accepted Mali’s argument that the decision-making process was procedurally flawed, as the UEMOA treaty requires such summits of heads of state and government to be held within the territory of a member state.

Alberta, a Canadian province rich in oil, has seen growing calls for independence. Jeff Rath, the legal advisor for 'Prosper Alberta,' claimed that the US supports Alberta's independence and described its ties with former President Trump as stronger than those with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Labor Federation president Gilles McGowan criticized the movement's use of social media campaigns, chatbots, and MAGA influencers, calling it foreign interference. Separatist leaders are reportedly seeking a $500 billion credit from the US Treasury to fund Alberta if a referendum on independence is approved, though no official referendum date has been set.

Designed by the studio STIPFOLD, the project explores how high-altitude hospitality can be both minimal and welcoming without imposing itself on an extreme landscape. Rather than relying on dramatic gestures, the design emphasizes restraint, functionality, and harmony with its surroundings.

The structure is conceived as a small shelter for limited groups, featuring a simple internal layout and a lofted sleeping area oriented toward the expansive mountain views. Its defining exterior element is a continuous fiber-concrete shell, sculpted to resemble a natural boulder. This form allows the building to visually recede into the terrain, reinforcing the idea that architecture should serve as a quiet frame for nature rather than a focal point competing with it.

Inside, the atmosphere shifts subtly from rugged to warm.

Known for her ability to balance absurdity with humanity, she brought unforgettable energy to every role. From the frantic mother in Home Alone to the eccentric Moira Rose in Schitt’s Creek, O’Hara had a rare gift for making audiences feel both laughter and empathy simultaneously. Her work on SCTV helped shape modern comedy, while her performances in Beetlejuice and other films turned unusual characters into memorable, relatable figures. Beyond her impeccable timing and skill, what truly set O’Hara apart was her warmth. Even her most over-the-top roles carried a softness and honesty that resonated with viewers. Her characters were never merely jokes—they were amplified versions of real people, drawing audiences into their world.

Rauch explains that fascism is often poorly defined and overused, but insists that recent developments have made the comparison unavoidable. While Trump’s first term could largely be understood as patrimonialism—treating the state as a personal possession—the author contends that the administration has since evolved toward a more coherent and aggressive ideology consistent with fascism.

Rauch identifies fascism not as a single policy or act, but as a constellation of traits that become clear when viewed together. These include the deliberate demolition of civic norms, glorification of violence, and the embrace of a “might makes right” worldview. He highlights Trump’s rhetoric praising brutality, his administration’s public celebration of force, and the transformation of ICE into a powerful national paramilitary]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-trump-s-second-term-governing-style-fits-the-historical-definition-of-fascism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-trump-s-second-term-governing-style-fits-the-historical-definition-of-fascism</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beachman ’64 Street Spec Blends Classic Café Racer Design with Modern Electric Power]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Beachman ’64 Street Spec is an electric motorcycle that intentionally looks backward to move forward. Designed by Canadian brand Beachman, the model draws heavy inspiration from 1960s British café racers, combining nostalgic aesthetics with contemporary electric engineering. Its low-profile silhouette, bubble-style windscreen, slim tires, and exposed frame evoke the romance of vintage European motorcycling, while carefully integrating modern components in a way that feels refined rather than technical.

At the heart of the Street Spec is a removable lithium battery, offered in two configurations: a 2.8 kWh pack providing up to 55 miles of range, and an optional 3.6 kWh version extending range to around 70 miles. Both options support regenerative braking and feature built-in charging ports. Charging to 80 percent takes roughly three hours using a standard charger, or about half that time with an optional fast charger, making the bike practical for daily urban use.

Krugman argues that both the EU and India are pursuing stronger economic ties with each other in part to reduce dependence on the United States, which he describes as an erratic and unreliable trade partner under Trump. He notes that U.S. tariffs, especially on Indian exports, and aggressive political and economic actions by the Trump administration have pushed these countries to seek alternative partners.

Major crops such as corn, soybeans, and cotton are experiencing dramatic losses, with net farm income projected to drop by $41 billion this year, one of the steepest declines in decades. Tariffs imposed during the Trump administration have severely impacted U.S. exports, particularly to China, while strict immigration policies have further strained the agricultural labor force, leaving many fields unharvested. Wilson emphasizes that these economic consequences are now becoming a political liability for Republicans, who remain associated with policies that are financially harming their most loyal supporters.

While China will mainly rely on solar energy for the station, Russia proposes to add a nuclear fission reactor to significantly increase available power and expand scientific capabilities. Despite political tensions following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the resulting budgetary and credibility issues affecting Roscosmos, nuclear space technology remains an area where Russia retains notable expertise.

To implement this contribution, Roscosmos plans a dedicated program called KS-LES (Lunar Energy Station Space Complex). It consists of three heavy spacecraft to be launched between 2033 and 2035. The first two missions will each deliver a 400-kilogram lunar rover tasked with scouting and preparing the site.

By repurposing old books, printed pages, and vintage photographs, Joosen transforms static text into lively visual narratives that give words a physical presence. His compositions often depict miniature figures interacting directly with language itself—mowing through lines of text like grass, harvesting words from a printed page, or rearranging letters as if they were tangible objects.

Joosen’s approach is rooted in an appreciation for traditional print culture. The use of aged paper and old-fashioned imagery gives his work a nostalgic quality, evoking a time when books were central, tactile objects rather than digital files. At the same time, the concepts behind the collages feel fresh and inventive.

Connecting to non-company Wi-Fi networks, such as public hotspots, will reveal the network name to managers, eliminating the generic 'Remote' status as a privacy shield.

The U.S. has bolstered its military presence in the Persian Gulf, including the deployment of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and escort ships, signaling a show of force. Inside the administration, however, there are conflicting approaches: some advocate for immediate military action, while others push for continued diplomacy and measured provocations to destabilize Iran without triggering open war.

Despite the Golden Globes introducing a Best Podcast category, Rogan’s show was not among the nominees, which included Amy Poehler’s 'Good Hang,' 'SmartLess,' 'Armchair Expert,' 'Call Her Daddy,' 'The Mel Robbins Podcast,' and NPR’s 'Up First.' Poehler ultimately won the award, sparking some criticism about rewarding a relatively new podcast from a celebrity.

The debate has intensified amid rising geopolitical tensions in Europe, including disputes related to Greenland and renewed uncertainty about the long-term commitment of the United States to European security.

Rutte argued that the creation of a separate European military force would weaken, rather than strengthen, Europe’s defense posture. According to him, such a move would introduce unnecessary complexity and deepen fragmentation within European defense structures. He provocatively stated that an independent European army would be welcomed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, as it would complicate decision-making and undermine cohesion within NATO.

While acknowledging that European countries should assume greater responsibility for their own security, Rutte emphasized th]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nato-secretary-general-warns-against-creating-a-separate-european-army-outside-the-alliance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nato-secretary-general-warns-against-creating-a-separate-european-army-outside-the-alliance</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Justice Department Releases 3.5 Million Pages Related to Epstein and Maxwell Cases]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 30, 2026, the U.S. Department of Justice announced the release of over 3 million additional pages in response to the Epstein Files Transparency Act, bringing the total production to nearly 3.5 million pages.

The detentions followed ICE operations in Minneapolis on January 9, during which four Oglala Sioux citizens were taken into custody. Three of them were later transferred to Fort Snelling, a site with profound historical significance for Indigenous peoples.

Fort Snelling served as an internment camp during the winter of 1862–63 after the U.S.-Dakota Wars, when approximately 1,700 Dakota elders, women, and children were forcibly confined there. Historians estimate that between 100 and 300 Dakota people died at the site due to starvation, disease, and exposure. Tribal leaders say using this location for modern detentions compounds historical trauma.

Choice Benefits are optional perks offered annually to Delta’s top-tier frequent flyers, but they must be actively chosen; otherwise, they expire unused.

Greg describes discovering that both he and his wife, who each hold Diamond status, had only selected one of their three available Choice Benefits. Acting just in time, he completed the remaining selections and secured a combination of Delta statement credits and bonus SkyMiles.

Rather than concentrating on complex objects or detailed scenes, Tihomirow’s practice revolves around manipulating light itself. Using simple geometric forms combined with reflective, glass-like, and glossy surfaces, he creates striking visual effects that feel both abstract and strangely familiar. Color in these works is not applied as texture or paint; instead, it emerges naturally from the way light bends, scatters, and reflects across surfaces.

The article emphasizes how minimal the setups are. There is no visual clutter or narrative context, just form and light interacting according to physical principles. This simplicity allows viewers to focus on the behavior of color and reflection, which can shift from soft, rainbow-like glows to stretched highlights reminiscent of melting candy.

According to Trump, lowering housing prices would unfairly benefit people who, in his words, 'didn't work very hard,' while harming those who have built wealth through homeownership. He framed homeownership as a source of pride and financial security, saying his administration intends to preserve that sense of stability for people who already own homes.

At the same time, Trump attempted to balance this position by reiterating his desire to make buying a home easier through lower interest rates. He said his administration would work to reduce mortgage rates and monthly payments, presenting this as a way to help buyers without decreasing overall housing prices. This stance, however, represents a notable shift from recent public statements in which Trump emphasized housing]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-signals-priority-on-protecting-home-values-over-broad-housing-affordability</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-signals-priority-on-protecting-home-values-over-broad-housing-affordability</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Western Seizures of Russian Shadow Fleet Tankers Escalate Sanctions Enforcement and Raise Risks of Naval Confrontation]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article claims that Western powers, especially NATO members like France, the US, Germany, and the UK, are engaging in undeclared naval piracy to enforce sanctions on Russia amid the Ukraine conflict.

On one hand, the United States maintains an extremely restrictive and complex immigration system that is nearly impossible to navigate for poor migrants, especially those forced to survive through precarious, informal employment. On the other hand, the U.S. economy depends heavily on this very same undocumented labor to sustain key sectors such as agriculture, domestic services, and low-skilled maintenance jobs, where local labor would be prohibitively expensive due to near full employment conditions.

Rather than legalizing and protecting this essential workforce, the author argues that successive governments have deliberately chosen to 'look the other way.' This approach benefits employers by maintaining a large pool of workers in a state of permanent vulnerability, which keeps wages low and labor compliant.

For decades, almost all technical details about these satellites remained secret, until the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) recently declassified images and partial specifications of the program.

The Jumpseat satellites weighed around 700 kilograms and were placed in highly elliptical Molniya orbits, optimized to linger over the Northern Hemisphere.

Los hechos se remontan a abril de 2024, cuando el canal 'Expediente Royuela' publicó en redes sociales una supuesta conversación entre Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente del Gobierno Pedro Sánchez, y Mohamed El Kettani, presidente del banco marroquí Attijariwafa Bank. Dicha conversación, que incluía referencias a presuntas cuentas bancarias y diálogos atribuidos al expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, fue negada rotundamente por ambas partes implicadas y nunca tuvo lugar.

La magistrada considera que existen indicios suficientes de que los investigados difundieron información falsa sin verificar su autenticidad, rechazando las explicaciones de Royuela (quien alegó reproducir un escrito supuestamente de Zapatero verificado por pericial caligráfica) y de Martínez Grasa (quien admitió no comprobar los]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/procesado-alberto-royuela-por-falsedad-documental-al-difundir-un-chat-falso-atribuido-a-begona-gomez-y-el-presidente-de-attijariwafa-bank</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/procesado-alberto-royuela-por-falsedad-documental-al-difundir-un-chat-falso-atribuido-a-begona-gomez-y-el-presidente-de-attijariwafa-bank</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 18:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La prohibición de redes sociales a menores es solo el primer paso: el verdadero desafío son las plataformas que violan la ley]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Enrique Dans destaca que el problema de las redes sociales no es solo la presencia de menores en ellas, sino el modelo de negocio de las plataformas que se basa en la manipulación de datos personales, la adicción y la polarización. La prohibición de acceso a menores es vista como una medida necesaria para proteger a los más vulnerables, pero Dans argumenta que no es suficiente. Asegura que estas plataformas, cuyo modelo de negocio infringe normativas como el GDPR, no pueden seguir operando sin cumplir con las leyes de privacidad y derechos fundamentales. La medida debe ir más allá, exigiendo responsabilidades penales para los ejecutivos de las empresas responsables y, en última instancia, cerrando aquellas plataformas que no respeten la legislación vigente.

En cuanto a la vivienda, Llamas ha criticado las políticas antiokupas que considera ineficaces y ha propuesto aumentar el parque público de viviendas en alquiler social y regular los precios del alquiler. Por su parte, en sanidad, ha señalado la desatención de la zona rural y la creciente privatización de los servicios como problemas graves.

Originalmente, 'facha' proviene de 'fascista', un concepto político que surgió en la Italia de Mussolini a comienzos del siglo XX. El fascismo fue un movimiento autoritario, ultranacionalista y totalitario que negaba las libertades individuales, controlaba todos los ámbitos de la sociedad y normalizaba la violencia como herramienta política. Reducir esta palabra a un insulto cotidiano empobrece el debate, pues hace difícil identificar comportamientos autoritarios reales. La noticia invita a la reflexión personal mediante un cuestionario sobre actitudes autoritarias, destacando que la verdadera esencia del fascismo va mucho más allá de una simple discrepancia política.

La digitalización y las redes sociales han amplificado esta dinámica, sustituyendo los debates basados en razones por el ruido mediático y los clics.

El texto repasa el ascenso del franquismo a partir de un contexto de crisis económica y política, el papel central del nacionalismo excluyente, la alianza con la Iglesia católica y la utilización del miedo al 'enemigo interno' para justificar la represión.

Ambos científicos, hasta ahora vinculados a universidades y centros de referencia en Nueva York, se han incorporado al Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont (ICP), en Sabadell, gracias a los programas de captación de talento ICREA y Catalunya Talent Bridge impulsados por la Generalitat.

La decisión coincide con un deterioro del clima académico en Estados Unidos, especialmente en áreas como la evolución humana, que, según explican, se ha convertido en un ámbito problemático por motivos ideológicos.

A través del lenguaje visual y del humor, la pieza reflexiona sobre los mecanismos de manipulación de la opinión pública en el contexto actual, marcado por el auge de la ultraderecha, la centralidad de las redes sociales y el poder creciente de grandes plataformas digitales.

La ilustración apunta de manera directa a figuras y dinámicas reconocibles del debate público contemporáneo, como el papel de líderes políticos de la ultraderecha —entre ellos Santiago Abascal— y la influencia de magnates tecnológicos como Elon Musk en el ecosistema informativo. La viñeta sugiere cómo discursos simplificados, emocionalmente cargados y amplificados algorítmicamente pueden moldear percepciones colectivas, desplazar debates complejos y normalizar marcos ideológicos extremos.

Quiles, conocido por perseguir a cargos públicos con preguntas provocadoras fuera de contextos informativos convencionales, increpó a Iglesias en plena calle utilizando argumentos habituales de la extrema derecha, como la teoría del “gran reemplazo”, y ataques personales relacionados con su trayectoria política y profesional.

Durante el encuentro, Quiles lanzó preguntas sobre supuestas declaraciones de Irene Montero y sobre el futuro político de Iglesias, insistiendo en un tono provocador mientras grababa la escena para difundirla posteriormente en redes sociales. Ante esta situación, Iglesias respondió de forma airada, calificando a Quiles de “fascista” y “cerdo”, e intentando apartar el micrófono del canal Estado de Alarma, medio vinculado a Javier Negre.

Durante la emisión, la presentadora Sonsoles Ónega y un colaborador identificaron la escena como una autovía urbana con los laterales inundados a causa de la borrasca Leonardo. Sin embargo, la interpretación resultó ser incorrecta y rápidamente llamó la atención de quienes conocen mínimamente la geografía gaditana.

El Puente Carranza no es una autovía urbana, sino la carretera CA-36, con un carril por sentido y otro reversible, y atraviesa directamente la Bahía de Cádiz. Al estar construido sobre el mar, no existen cunetas ni márgenes terrestres que puedan inundarse: los laterales y la parte inferior del puente están permanentemente rodeados de agua salada. Este detalle básico fue pasado por alto en el programa, lo que provocó una situación tan llamativa como cómic]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-error-televisivo-sobre-el-puente-carranza-provoca-burlas-y-criticas-en-cadiz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-error-televisivo-sobre-el-puente-carranza-provoca-burlas-y-criticas-en-cadiz</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP de Madrid cierra filas con el alcalde de Móstoles y niega que existiera acoso tras archivar la denuncia interna]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Partido Popular de Madrid ha defendido públicamente la actuación del partido y la inocencia del alcalde de Móstoles, Manuel Bautista, tras la información publicada por EL PAÍS sobre una denuncia interna por presunto acoso sexual y laboral presentada por una concejala. Alfonso Serrano, secretario general del PP madrileño y número dos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha asegurado que no se trató en ningún momento de un caso de acoso, sino de una disputa de carácter laboral sin pruebas que la respaldaran.

Según la versión de Serrano, la denunciante trasladó inicialmente al partido un escrito en febrero de 2024 en el que hablaba exclusivamente de discriminaciones laborales. En una reunión posterior, la dirección del PP le preguntó expresamente si estaba denunciando acoso o abuso sexual, a lo que ella habría respondido negativamente.

Los vecinos de Telde, en Gran Canaria, habían expresado su preocupación porque esta actividad dejaba preservativos y toallitas usadas en parques y senderos, lo que generaba incomodidad y riesgos para la población, incluidos niños. Trakatá defendió la práctica, insistiendo en la importancia de la discreción y cuestionando los argumentos de Montero sobre posibles contagios de enfermedades de transmisión sexual (ETS) por contacto con objetos desechados. Montero argumentó que el civismo requiere precaución, señalando que aunque el riesgo de contagio sea bajo, existe la posibilidad de que alguien pueda verse afectado, especialmente menores.

En los primeros días se desactivaron o bloquearon alrededor de 4,7 millones de cuentas identificadas como pertenecientes a menores de esa edad, y cifras posteriores elevan el impacto, con más de 415.000 cuentas inhabilitadas solo en Snapchat hasta finales de enero de 2026.

Desde su creación en 2023, la entidad ha adquirido ocho pisos propiedad de grandes tenedores y fondos de inversión, muchos de ellos con inquilinos en situación de vulnerabilidad y bajo amenaza de desahucio. Gracias a este modelo, unas 30 personas, entre ellas diez menores, han logrado una solución habitacional estable.

El proyecto surge de años de trabajo comunitario y de apoyo mutuo en el barrio, donde el problema de la vivienda se identificó como el principal factor de precariedad. A diferencia de otras cooperativas de vivienda, Les Juntes no construye nuevos edificios, sino que compra pisos ya habitados, dispersos en distintos bloques, principalmente a fondos como Divarian o Solvia.

El autor no idealiza el pasado, pero defiende que crecer en un entorno imperfecto enseñaba a desarrollar criterio, instinto y resiliencia, algo que considera en peligro con las políticas de “riesgo cero”.

Arjona cuestiona que la prohibición sea una medida de salud pública basada en evidencias sólidas. Apoyándose en estudios recientes y en las tesis del psiquiatra Sami Timimi, sostiene que existe una tendencia a simplificar problemas complejos mediante soluciones rápidas y efectistas, lo que denomina la “McDonaldización de la salud mental”. Según esta lógica, prohibir las redes calma la ansiedad adulta y genera titulares políticos, pero no aborda las causas profundas]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prohibir-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-entre-la-proteccion-el-miedo-y-la-renuncia-educativa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prohibir-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-entre-la-proteccion-el-miedo-y-la-renuncia-educativa</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recuperado en el Palacio de Liria un retrato de Sorolla y dos obras más que debían formar parte del patrimonio estatal]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha recuperado tres obras de arte desaparecidas desde la década de 1970 que se encontraban depositadas en el Palacio de Liria, en Madrid, propiedad de la Casa de Alba. Entre ellas destaca el cuadro 'La Chata', un retrato de Isabel de Borbón y Borbón pintado por Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida en 1908, considerado una pieza relevante dentro de la producción del artista valenciano. La obra, de grandes dimensiones, había perdido su rastro durante décadas y su localización se produjo en el marco de una investigación iniciada tras detectarse una pintura cuyo paradero no estaba claro durante una exposición organizada por la propia Casa de Alba entre 2023 y 2024.

Además del lienzo de Sorolla, los agentes localizaron otros dos óleos del pintor José Moreno Carbonero: un retrato de Alfonso XIII y otro de Eduardo Dato.

Diversas agencias llegaron a ofertar pisos por entre 411.000 y más de 500.000 euros, cuando el precio máximo fijado por la Generalitat Valenciana ronda los 230.000 euros. Según testimonios recogidos por el diario INFORMACIÓN, parte de esas operaciones incluían pagos en dinero negro que superaban los 200.000 euros, una práctica destinada a burlar la normativa que regula la vivienda de protección pública.

El caso afecta a una promoción especialmente controvertida, ya que entre los adjudicatarios figuran cargos públicos, familiares de altos funcionarios municipales y personal de la propia Administración.

Corresponde a la letrada de la Administración de Justicia del Tribunal Supremo fijar la cuantía, aunque previsiblemente será impugnada por el condenado.

En estos casos es habitual solicitar un dictamen orientativo al ICAM, un informe que no es vinculante pero sí influyente.

El motivo principal es que el ponente designado para evaluar los suplicatorios del juez Pablo Llarena pertenecía al mismo grupo político que Vox, partido que ejerció la acusación popular en el juicio por el procés y el 1-O. El TJUE considera que esta circunstancia vulneró el derecho a un tratamiento imparcial y equitativo, ya que se incumplió la regla interna del Parlamento de evitar ponentes con afinidades políticas que puedan generar dudas legítimas sobre su neutralidad.

Este resultado, que ha despertado un enorme interés científico y social, abre la puerta a futuros ensayos clínicos en humanos, previstos dentro de dos o tres años. Sin embargo, el principal obstáculo para dar ese paso es la falta de financiación suficiente.

El coste mínimo estimado para iniciar los ensayos clínicos en humanos asciende a unos 30 millones de euros, una cantidad que no está cubierta por los actuales Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Aunque el CNIO recibió en 2023 un total de 36,5 millones de euros en subvenciones públicas, estos fondos se destinan a la actividad global del centro, que desarrolla decenas de proyectos simultáneos, y no de forma exclusiva al estudio de Barbacid.

Destaca cómo Uclés, pese a su éxito y proyección, ha decidido boicotear unas jornadas sobre la Guerra Civil organizadas por Arturo Pérez-Reverte, tituladas '1936. La guerra que todos perdimos'.

Lo que debía haber sido un momento de celebración se vio empañado por una oleada de insultos y ataques personales en redes sociales, motivados por el idioma que utilizó en una entrevista posterior a la competición. Delago habló en ladino, su lengua materna, durante una conversación con RAI Ladinia, el canal público italiano que emite íntegramente en este idioma.

Los comentarios ofensivos, lanzados principalmente por usuarios anónimos o los llamados “leones de teclado”, incluían mensajes como “si representas a Italia, habla italiano” o insultos de carácter xenófobo. Estas reacciones generaron un debate público sobre la diversidad lingüística en Italia y el derecho a utilizar lenguas minoritarias en espacios mediáticos y deportivos.

Inicialmente, Bezos mantuvo la independencia editorial y permitió que el medio realizara un periodismo crítico y de calidad, convirtiéndose en un referente durante la presidencia de Donald Trump. Sin embargo, con el tiempo, intervenciones directas en decisiones editoriales y cambios estratégicos destinados a la rentabilidad llevaron a despidos masivos y a la eliminación de secciones clave como noticias locales, deportes y corresponsalías internacionales. La publicación perdió suscriptores y buena parte de su identidad como periódico independiente y local. El artículo destaca la paradoja de que, a pesar de contar con una fortuna personal colosal, Bezos optó por sacrificar la esencia del medio en lugar de asumir pérdidas económicas, lo que contrasta con la dedicación de históricos magnates de la prensa como William Randolph Hearst.

Discovery por parte de Netflix. En lugar de centrarse en cuestiones de competencia, Hawley dedicó buena parte de su turno a atacar el contenido de la plataforma, especialmente la presencia de personajes y temáticas trans en programas dirigidos al público infantil.

Hawley acusó a Netflix de promover lo que denominó una “ideología transgénero”, llegando a afirmar, sin aportar pruebas, que casi la mitad de los contenidos infantiles de la plataforma impulsan esta supuesta agenda. El codirector ejecutivo de Netflix, Ted Sarandos, negó rotundamente esas cifras y calificó los datos de inexactos, señalando que no sabía de dónde procedían.

Se eliminó la obligatoriedad de inscribirse en el Registro de demanda de vivienda de la Generalitat y de presentar una declaración responsable que acreditara el cumplimiento de requisitos para acceder a estas viviendas. Estos mecanismos actuaban como filtro inicial antes del visado final por parte de la Conselleria. La normativa anterior pretendía garantizar transparencia y evitar fraudes en la adjudicación.

La Conselleria de Vivienda defiende el cambio argumentando que separa mejor los demandantes de promoción pública y privada (con perfiles y rentas distintos), y que el nuevo decreto refuerza los controles en la fase de visado, incluyendo autorizaciones para verificar datos tributarios y económicos con otras administraciones.

Los hechos tuvieron como víctima a un joven que fue perseguido, insultado y golpeado por un grupo de personas por motivo de su orientación sexual. Según el relato judicial, los agresores le gritaron expresiones como 'maricón de mierda' y 'mira cómo corre el maricón' mientras se burlaban de él antes de alcanzarlo y atacarlo físicamente.

Durante el juicio celebrado en la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, los dos acusados reconocieron haber insultado y acosado verbalmente a la víctima, aunque negaron haberle golpeado directamente y atribuyeron los puñetazos a un tercer amigo.

Paralelamente, Renfe ha decidido paralizar de forma temporal la compra prevista de 30 nuevos trenes de alta velocidad capaces de alcanzar los 350 km/h.

Destaca la famosa investigación sobre el Trinche Carlovich, un jugador argentino mítico y olvidado que superaba incluso a Maradona según leyendas locales, y que les llevó a Rosario con entrevistas a figuras como Menotti, Pekerman y Valdano. Román valora la libertad creativa que Robinson otorgaba al equipo, su enfoque en la imagen con humor británico estilo BBC, frente al estilo más polémico de Josep Pedrerol.

En México, figuras como José Vasconcelos y Elena Torres Cuéllar impulsaron la educación rural, la construcción de bibliotecas y la publicación de libros y folletos accesibles a la población. En China, tras la Revolución de 1949, el Partido Comunista implementó campañas de alfabetización masiva, introdujo la simplificación de caracteres y desarrolló bibliotecas públicas y rurales, logrando una tasa de alfabetización del 97% en 2021.

Los informes de seguimiento de las pruebas piloto realizadas durante el último año muestran que reducir la jornada laboral a 32 horas semanales y ofrecer flexibilidad horaria mejora significativamente la salud emocional de las trabajadoras y trabajadores. Expertas en sociología y psicología del trabajo destacan que este modelo disminuye el agotamiento crónico (burnout), ya que un tercer día de descanso permite una desconexión real que la jornada tradicional de 40 horas no garantiza. Además, las trabajadoras que experimentan bienestar emocional son un 15% más productivas y tienen un 40% menos de bajas por ansiedad.

Aunque nació como una herramienta para garantizar el acceso a la vivienda a hogares de ingresos bajos y medios, la reducción sostenida de su producción y la flexibilización de los requisitos de acceso han ido desdibujando su función social. En un contexto de crisis residencial y subida generalizada de precios, las VPO son cada vez menos y están dirigidas a rentas más altas.

Desde 1991 se han construido cerca de 1,7 millones de viviendas protegidas en España, pero muchas de ellas han perdido con el tiempo su calificación y han pasado al mercado libre, contribuyendo a la escalada de precios. La producción actual está en mínimos históricos: en 1995 se concedieron más VPO que en todo el periodo comprendido entre 2017 y 2025.

Tras una denuncia presentada en noviembre de 2025 por el escritor y periodista italiano Ezio Gavazzeni, se ha inscrito como investigado a un hombre de 80 años, excamionero residente en Pordenone, acusado de homicidio voluntario continuado. Según testimonios recopilados, este individuo se jactaba de haber participado en viajes organizados en los que ciudadanos europeos, principalmente italianos, pagaban elevadas sumas —entre 80.000 y 100.000 euros— por disparar con rifles de francotirador a civiles indefensos desde las colinas que rodeaban la ciudad, incluyendo mujeres, ancianos y niños, con tarifas más altas por menores. Los Carabinieri registraron su domicilio y hallaron siete armas legales.

También hay alertas naranjas en otras comarcas como el Estrecho gaditano y puntos de Jaén.

Como medidas preventivas, se han suspendido las clases presenciales en toda Andalucía excepto en Almería, y Renfe ha cancelado numerosos servicios ferroviarios, especialmente trenes de media distancia, Alvia y algunos Avant en provincias como Cádiz, Málaga, Sevilla y Jaén.

La instalación, ubicada en Azuqueca de Henares, cuenta con una superficie de 6.000 metros cuadrados e integrará áreas de producción, investigación y desarrollo, así como oficinas.

La compañía prevé iniciar la actividad industrial en el primer trimestre de 2026, con una capacidad productiva que alcanzará hasta 15.000 vehículos anuales a partir de 2028. En una primera fase, la inversión estimada asciende a 30 millones de euros en un periodo de cinco años.

Gates calificó esas afirmaciones de falsas y absurdas, asegurando que se basan en un correo electrónico que Epstein se habría escrito a sí mismo y que nunca fue enviado.

Petro señaló que los grandes capos del narcotráfico ya no se encuentran en Colombia, sino en centros financieros y ciudades de lujo como Dubái, Madrid y Miami, desde donde manejan capitales multimillonarios fuera del alcance de la justicia. Destacó que las incautaciones de cocaína, aunque históricas, no afectan a los verdaderos beneficiarios del negocio, y que las sanciones económicas como las listas OFAC son insuficientes si no se persiguen los capitales ilícitos a nivel global.

El plan tiene como objetivo construir una flota interplanetaria que permita la exploración, colonización y extracción de materiales en todo el sistema solar. Inspirado en la filosofía científica de la dinastía Ming y en las expediciones del almirante Zheng He, este proyecto combina objetivos históricos y económicos, buscando explotar asteroides cercanos a la Tierra y otros cuerpos celestes, valorados en más de 100 billones de dólares. En una primera fase, entre 2026 y 2030, China probará la viabilidad técnica de la extracción de recursos en asteroides cercanos y desarrollará un sistema lunar de minería y suministro en el espacio cislunar. Para 2050, la explotación se extenderá a Marte y el cinturón de asteroides, y hacia 2075 se prevé alcanzar planetas interiores y gigantes gaseosos como Júpiter y Saturno.

LMB es un proveedor clave de sistemas para aviones de combate, submarinos nucleares y misiles, lo que la convierte en un actor estratégico para la defensa nacional. Esta decisión ha generado una reacción unánime de la oposición política francesa, que denuncia la pérdida de soberanía industrial y la entrega de capacidades críticas al capital extranjero. La Dirección General de Armamento (DGA) también se mostró en contra de la operación, subrayando los riesgos para la autonomía tecnológica del país.

El suceso ocurrió el lunes por la noche en un tren regional que cubría la ruta entre Kaiserslautern y Saarbrücken, en el suroeste del país, según informó la compañía ferroviaria Deutsche Bahn (DB).

Durante un control rutinario de billetes, el revisor, identificado como Serkan C., detectó que un joven de 26 años no disponía de título de transporte. Al intentar expulsarlo del convoy, el pasajero reaccionó con extrema violencia y golpeó repetidamente al empleado en la cabeza. El ataque se produjo poco después de que el tren saliera de la estación de Landstuhl, en el distrito de Kaiserslautern.

Como consecuencia de la agresión, el revisor quedó gravemente herido y tuvo que ser reanimado en el propio lugar de los hechos antes de ser trasladado de urgencia a un hospital en estado crítico.

La visita formaba parte de una gira por Aragón para respaldar al candidato del PP, Jorge Azcón, y poner en valor el papel del sector primario y de la industria agroalimentaria en el desarrollo económico del medio rural.

La novela, concebida como una carta de amor onírica y surrealista a Barcelona, presenta una ciudad múltiple y superpuesta, construida a partir de capas temporales y voces literarias que abarcan distintas épocas y sensibilidades culturales.

Uclés explica que su acercamiento a Barcelona fue fruto de una estancia prolongada gracias a la beca Montserrat Roig, durante la cual se sumergió en la literatura catalana y en la historia cultural de la ciudad. De ese proceso surge un relato coral, con más de 80 artistas e intelectuales, que busca provocar al lector y transmitir una imagen caótica y rica de Barcelona, similar a un mosaico o un *trencadís*.

Aunque ambas formaciones defienden desde hace tiempo la necesidad de regularizar a cientos de miles de personas que ya viven y trabajan en España, el desacuerdo surge por la estrategia política y el discurso público en torno a los derechos asociados a esa regularización.

Sumar considera que las declaraciones de Irene Montero, en las que plantea ampliar el derecho al voto a los inmigrantes regularizados o incluso cambiar la ley para permitirlo, refuerzan el marco argumental de PP y Vox.

Durante la prueba se cargaron casi mil toneladas de propelentes en la etapa central y la segunda etapa, alcanzándose el llenado total de los tanques.

Se describen métodos clásicos para dividir en dos partes (por la diagonal o por el centro) y en cuatro (por las dos diagonales o cortes perpendiculares), destacando que todos generan piezas equivalentes. Para tres partes, un corte paralelo simple falla en igualar el borde, ya que los trozos centrales y laterales difieren en corteza.

Las declaraciones han generado una ola de críticas y preocupación en redes sociales y entre expertos en derechos civiles, que consideran que la presencia de agentes federales en los puntos de votación constituye una forma clara de intimidación del electorado.

La propuesta choca directamente con la Constitución estadounidense, que en el artículo I, sección 4, asigna a los estados la regulación de las elecciones, manteniendo un sistema descentralizado gestionado por funcionarios locales de ambos partidos.

El Gobierno autonómico compró un edificio con capacidad para 20 menores, pero la alcaldesa socialista Lorena Cueto se mostró contraria al proyecto, calificando la construcción del centro como un “castigo” al municipio. Además, reveló públicamente la ubicación del edificio y amenazó con cortar el suministro de agua y luz, lo que provocó críticas del Ejecutivo regional, que consideró su actitud como racista. La llegada de los primeros menores ha intensificado la tensión, con manifestaciones de vecinos y presencia de Policía y Guardia Civil para garantizar la seguridad del centro. Cueto ha defendido que su oposición no tiene motivaciones raciales ni de falta de solidaridad, sino que responde a la defensa de los intereses de los vecinos y a la falta de condiciones para la plena inclusión en Cartes.

Estas momias, conservadas gracias al clima árido, pertenecen a una población antigua que los científicos denominan 'fantasma', ya que su linaje genético no había sido identificado previamente de forma directa en restos físicos.

Dirigido por la arqueogenetista Nada Salem, del Instituto Max Planck de Antropología Evolutiva, el análisis muestra que esta rama se separó de los linajes subsaharianos hace unos 50.000 años, coincidiendo con la migración de humanos modernos fuera de África. El grupo permaneció mayoritariamente aislado, con contactos genéticos muy limitados con poblaciones del sur del Sáhara y una mezcla mínima con agricultores del Levante.

El sistema de recompensa se ve sobreestimulado por notificaciones, scroll infinito y likes, generando picos de dopamina que pueden llevar a un déficit crónico, similar a una adicción, según expertos como Anna Lembke de Stanford. Esto provoca irritabilidad, pérdida de interés en actividades offline, ansiedad, depresión y alteraciones en la imagen corporal, con estudios que muestran duplicación del riesgo de problemas mentales graves con más de tres horas diarias de uso, y cambios estructurales en el cerebro tras pocos años.

La decisión llega pese a que el Gobierno ha rebajado el alcance de la medida para intentar atraer el respaldo de Junts y del PNV, limitando la protección en los casos en los que la vivienda pertenezca a propietarios con menos de tres inmuebles.

El Ejecutivo optó por dividir el decreto ómnibus en dos textos: uno centrado en la revalorización de las pensiones y otro con medidas sociales como la moratoria de desahucios, la prórroga del bono social eléctrico, la prohibición de cortes de suministros a hogares vulnerables, deducciones fiscales por eficiencia energética y ayudas a personas afectadas por catástrofes naturales.

La solución fue innovadora: eliminar las alas tradicionales y diseñar el fuselaje de manera que él mismo generara sustentación, dando origen a los llamados Cuerpos Sustentadores (Lifting Bodies). El primer prototipo, el M2-F1, estaba construido de madera y tubos de acero y fue remolcado por un Pontiac descapotable para sus primeras pruebas. Este diseño evolucionó hacia modelos metálicos como el M2-F2 y el HL-10, lanzados desde bombarderos B-52, que permitían aterrizajes planeados pero extremadamente difíciles. El accidente del piloto Bruce Peterson en 1967 dio lugar a la famosa introducción de la serie 'El Hombre de los Seis Millones de Dólares'. Con el X-24B, la NASA logró aterrizajes precisos y sentó las bases para el Transbordador Espacial.

En una extensa carta dirigida a los miembros del CEN, a la que ha tenido acceso EL MUNDO, el dirigente denuncia que su cese fue decidido de manera precipitada, sin debate interno y sin que, según él, muchos de los miembros llegaran siquiera a leer el informe que lo justificaba.

Ortega Smith sostiene que la votación de su expulsión se realizó en apenas dos minutos a través de un grupo de WhatsApp, lo que a su juicio demuestra que el CEN ha dejado de ser un órgano deliberativo para convertirse en una instancia meramente formal que ratifica decisiones tomadas de antemano por la cúpula del partido.

Esta situación coloca a España como uno de los cuatro países europeos donde los ingresos por pensión pública son suficientes para cubrir los costes básicos de la jubilación, junto con Polonia, República Checa y Rumanía. No obstante, esta suficiencia promedio no elimina las vulnerabilidades. Los colectivos más expuestos al riesgo de pobreza son las mujeres jubiladas, quienes no poseen vivienda en propiedad y los hogares con ingresos más bajos. La vivienda representa el 38% del gasto de los mayores, y aunque el 80% de los jubilados son propietarios, los que viven de alquiler enfrentan mayor presión económica. Otros gastos relevantes incluyen alimentos (18%), transporte (8%) y ocio (5%). Comparativamente, países como Alemania y Francia muestran déficits de hasta un 26%, mi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-uno-de-los-cuatro-paises-europeos-donde-la-pension-publica-cubre-el-coste-de-vida-de-los-jubilados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-uno-de-los-cuatro-paises-europeos-donde-la-pension-publica-cubre-el-coste-de-vida-de-los-jubilados</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Investigadores identifican un nuevo mecanismo de acción de la metformina en la diabetes tipo 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un grupo de investigadores del CIBERDEM, en colaboración con la Universidad de Barcelona, el CSIC-UAM y el Instituto de Biología y Genética Molecular de Valladolid, ha identificado un nuevo mecanismo que explica cómo actúa la metformina, el fármaco más utilizado para tratar la diabetes tipo 2. El estudio revela un “eje regulador” celular que involucra al receptor PPARβ/δ, fundamental para que la metformina ejerza parte de sus efectos en la reducción de glucosa en sangre. Además, este mecanismo aumenta los niveles de la proteína GDF15, asociada con una mejor utilización de la energía y la regulación del metabolismo. Este hallazgo no cambia los tratamientos actuales, pero aporta información crucial para el desarrollo de terapias más personalizadas y eficaces, especialmente para pacientes que responden de manera variable a la metformina. Los científicos destacan que, a pesar de décadas de uso, este medicamento todavía tiene secretos que desvelar, lo que podría abrir nuevas vías para mejor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigadores-identifican-un-nuevo-mecanismo-de-accion-de-la-metformina-en-la-diabetes-tipo-2</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigadores-identifican-un-nuevo-mecanismo-de-accion-de-la-metformina-en-la-diabetes-tipo-2</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 14:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Críticas al legado y comportamiento reciente de Quentin Tarantino en Hollywood]]></title><description><![CDATA[Quentin Tarantino, uno de los directores más influyentes de Hollywood, vuelve a estar en el centro de la polémica con el reestreno de Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, una versión extendida de su saga de venganza que apenas ofrece cambios significativos respecto a las películas originales. La noticia recalca que, aunque Tarantino es innegablemente talentoso, su comportamiento durante los rodajes ha sido problemático, incluyendo accidentes que pusieron en riesgo a Uma Thurman y la gestión cuestionable de su relación con Harvey Weinstein. Además, el artículo destaca la actitud reciente de Tarantino: crítico de otros cineastas, provocador en redes y semirretirado, mientras sus colegas siguen innovando y defendiendo el cine en salas. También se menciona su apoyo a Israel y sus comentarios polémicos sobre conflictos internacionales, lo que ha aumentado la percepción negativa sobre su persona.

Según el artículo, Epstein y su red de contactos habrían utilizado lo que se denomina una “trampa de miel” para chantajear a figuras políticas de alto rango, entre ellas el presidente Clinton, lo que supuestamente debilitó su posición como mediador en las negociaciones de Camp David y Wye River. Se destaca que Benjamin Netanyahu, primer ministro de Israel, se opuso a hacer concesiones y que las ofertas presentadas por Clinton y Ehud Barak eran insuficientes y sesgadas a favor de Israel, según reconocimientos de negociadores israelíes y estadounidenses. Documentos y testimonios, como los de Ari Ben-Menashe, Gordon Thomas y Daniel Halper, sugieren que las relaciones de Clinton con Lewinsky fueron aprovechadas para controlar sus decisiones políticas y evitar un acuerdo con Arafat.

El formato, producido por El Terrat, ha superado con creces las previsiones iniciales al lograr una cuota media del 13,5% en su primera etapa, aunque ha experimentado bajadas puntuales (como en enero, rozando el 9%).

La comunicación oficial no ha detallado las causas de la muerte, aunque varios medios locales e internacionales apuntan a que pudo haber sido asesinado cerca de la localidad de Zintan, en el noroeste del país, a unos 140 kilómetros de Trípoli. Estas informaciones, citadas por The Libya Observer y confirmadas por fuentes de la cadena Al Yazira, no han sido respaldadas aún por una investigación oficial concluyente.

Saif al Islam fue una de las figuras más relevantes del régimen de su padre y durante años fue considerado su posible sucesor.

La decisión responde a la aplicación del principio de prejudicialidad penal, al coincidir los hechos investigados por Hacienda con los que forman parte de una causa penal en curso por presuntos delitos de corrupción en los negocios.

Carrasco, esposa de Fernando Camino, presidente de Quirón Prevención, está imputada en una pieza separada vinculada a la investigación sobre la pareja de la presidenta madrileña, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. El juez considera que la continuidad del procedimiento administrativo podría interferir con la instrucción penal, ya que las personas y operaciones examinadas por la Agencia Tributaria son sustancialmente las mismas que se investigan en sede judicial.

Los ataques se han concentrado tanto en el norte como en el sur del enclave, especialmente en la ciudad de Gaza y en Jan Yunis.

Fuentes locales y sanitarias informan de que los bombardeos y el fuego de artillería han alcanzado zonas residenciales, tiendas de campaña donde se refugia población desplazada y áreas costeras, provocando incendios y un número indeterminado de heridos, algunos en estado crítico.

Según los últimos datos del Observatorio de Vivienda Asequible de Provivienda, el 25% de los propietarios controla más del 63% de las viviendas del país, mientras que un reducido 0,2% de grandes tenedores acapara casi el 10% del parque residencial. Esta acumulación de inmuebles refuerza el poder económico de quienes ya poseen patrimonio y limita el acceso a la vivienda de amplias capas de la población.

El debate político se ha reavivado tras el acuerdo entre el Gobierno y el PNV para excluir a los propietarios con una sola vivienda en alquiler de la moratoria antidesahucios.

Sin embargo, muchos familiares denunciaron que la decisión no se tomó por seguridad, sino que derivó en un abandono y desatención de los residentes. Algunas personas tuvieron que retirar a sus familiares de los centros debido a su deterioro físico y psicológico, incluyendo deshidratación, maltrato y falta de terapias. A pesar de estas salidas forzadas, la Comunidad de Madrid continuó cobrando por las plazas, justificándolo como “voluntario” y argumentando que la plaza quedaba reservada.

Cada sensor puede cubrir hasta diez kilómetros de vía y procesa la información localmente, enviando alertas a los centros de control en un plazo de entre cinco y diez segundos.

El objetivo principal de esta solución es aumentar la seguridad ferroviaria y reducir de forma significativa los costes de mantenimiento y supervisión.

Carabante sostuvo que la normativa vigente permite que fondos de inversión o grandes propietarios adquieran bloques completos de viviendas y los destinen íntegramente a uso turístico, y aseguró que muchos de los desalojos que se están produciendo se amparan en regulaciones aprobadas en etapas anteriores, bajo gobiernos de Más Madrid y PSOE.

Esta situación, revelada por Público, ha suscitado dudas fundadas sobre un posible conflicto de intereses, ya que la compañía debía fiscalizar la actividad y las cuentas de hospitales en los que tenía intereses económicos.

Hill International Spain lleva desempeñando labores de supervisión de hospitales privatizados en la región desde 2007, a través de contratos renovados y prorrogados por distintos gobiernos autonómicos.

La medida se adopta para ejecutar las condenas ratificadas por el Tribunal Supremo el 7 de enero de 2026: siete años y medio de cárcel para Zulueta (por integración en organización terrorista y depósito de armas y explosivos con finalidad terrorista) y cuatro años para Enparantza (por integración en organización terrorista). Ambas penas provienen del sumario 13/13, un caso controvertido por las intervenciones del CNI y las denuncias de torturas durante el proceso.

El auto, fechado el 28 de enero y difundido por Efe, concede diez días naturales desde la notificación para que ingresen voluntariamente en prisión; de no hacerlo, se emitirán órdenes de busca y captura. La defensa de ambos ha anunciado recurso ante el Tribunal Constitucional, aunque este no suspende la ejecución de la pena.

Los hechos, ocurridos entre noviembre de 2024 y el 14 de febrero de 2025, incluyen el uso de sustancias químicas para provocar sumisión química en el menor, con el objetivo de facilitar los abusos. Según el comunicado oficial, el padre del niño, separado previamente de la madre, habría entregado voluntariamente a su hijo a estos adultos para que cometieran las violencias sexuales agravadas por el empleo de dichas sustancias. Los cargos imputados abarcan violación y agresión sexual con tortura o actos de barbarie, así como la administración sin consentimiento de sustancias que afectan el juicio o el control de las acciones del menor de 15 años con fines delictivos.

La petición ha sido dirigida a la delegada del Gobierno en Navarra y se fundamenta en la responsabilidad institucional derivada de una mala praxis policial acreditada judicialmente.

La resolución del TEDH, que ya es definitiva después de que la Abogacía del Estado decidiera no recurrirla, concluye que durante la investigación se produjeron irregularidades muy graves.

Estas viviendas, levantadas sobre suelo público vendido por el Ayuntamiento a una cooperativa por 6,6 millones de euros, estaban destinadas a garantizar el acceso a la vivienda habitual y a evitar cualquier uso especulativo.

La normativa autonómica establece que los adjudicatarios de viviendas protegidas en régimen de compra deben empadronarse en ellas y destinarlas a residencia habitual, además de cumplir estrictos requisitos económicos. Sin embargo, según ha denunciado Compromís, algunos propietarios no residen en los inmuebles, otros viven en el extranjero y varios pisos han sido anunciados en portales inmobiliarios a precios muy superiores a los permitidos, lo que constituiría una clara irregularidad.

Según los médicos forenses, este tipo de fracturas puede darse tanto en casos de ahorcamiento como en estrangulamientos, aunque son más frecuentes en homicidios.

Según la investigación, los hechos se prolongaron desde junio de 2024 y se produjeron de forma reiterada en distintos ámbitos de la vida cotidiana de la víctima, incluyendo el centro educativo, espacios de ocio y celebraciones públicas.

Los investigadores han constatado que las agresiones eran tanto físicas como verbales y que se llevaban a cabo de manera grupal, con el objetivo de intensificar la intimidación y la humillación hacia la víctima.

Los hechos incluyen zarandear, golpear, vejar y encerrar a los menores en habitaciones sin supervisión. Las pruebas clave son varios vídeos grabados por trabajadoras del centro, quienes decidieron permanecer en sus puestos durante más tiempo para documentar las agresiones en lugar de abandonar el empleo como habían hecho otros empleados anteriormente. En una de las grabaciones se ve cómo la mujer obliga a una niña a tragar un trozo de manzana sujetándola del cuello con fuerza. En otra, coge la mano de un niño y la utiliza para golpear a otro menor. La detenida ha sido puesta en libertad con medidas cautelares, incluyendo la prohibición de acercarse a los niños, contactar con ellos o realizar cualquier actividad laboral relacionada con menores mientras se tramita la causa.

Estos documentos muestran una correspondencia y relación continuada entre Chomsky y Epstein incluso después de la condena de este último en 2008 por delitos sexuales relacionados con menores. Prashad, quien sufrió abusos sexuales en su infancia, afirma que no puede tolerar ningún tipo de vínculo con alguien que explotó a niños, y considera indefendible la amistad de Chomsky con Epstein. Destaca que en febrero de 2019, meses antes de los nuevos cargos federales contra Epstein, Chomsky le aconsejó ignorar la cobertura mediática negativa y la 'histeria' sobre el abuso de mujeres. Prashad lamenta que, pese a ser su mentor, Chomsky nunca mencionara estas reuniones o contactos en sus conversaciones personales.

Frente a esa visión equidistante, el autor sostiene que la guerra tuvo ganadores y perdedores muy claros: los republicanos, demócratas y defensores de la legalidad fueron derrotados, mientras que los fascistas no solo ganaron militarmente, sino que se enriquecieron materialmente gracias al conflicto y a la represión posterior.

Maestre apoya su argumento en una cita del propio Francisco Franco, pronunciada en 1940, en la que reconocía que los ricos que participaron en la guerra salieron aún más ricos al finalizarla, gracias a la apropiación y revalorización de bienes que antes estaban en riesgo. Este reconocimiento, según el autor, desmonta el relato de la derrota colectiva y explica por qué determinados sectores insisten en diluir las responsabilidades: aceptar que hubo vencedores implica admitir ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El bitcoin cae un 40% tras su máximo de 2025 en un contexto de menor demanda y cambio de preferencias de inversión]]></title><description><![CDATA[El bitcoin atraviesa una fase de fuerte corrección tras haber marcado un máximo histórico en octubre de 2025. Desde entonces, su cotización ha caído alrededor de un 40%, pasando de más de 105.000 euros a situarse en torno a los 64.000 euros en apenas cuatro meses. A diferencia de caídas anteriores, los analistas subrayan que no existe un detonante único y claro que explique este desplome, lo que ha alimentado la preocupación en el mercado.

Según fuentes citadas por Bloomberg, el problema principal es una crisis de confianza. La demanda de bitcoin estaría disminuyendo, la liquidez sería más limitada y el activo se estaría comportando de forma cada vez más desconectada de los grandes mercados financieros. Tradicionalmente, las criptomonedas se han presentado como un refugio alternativo en periodos de inestabilidad, pero en esta ocasión no han reaccionado ni al estrés geopolítico ni a la debilidad del dólar, ni siquiera a las fuertes oscilaciones recientes del oro y la plata.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en el anuncio realizado por Sánchez en Dubái, donde avanzó su intención de prohibir el acceso a las redes sociales a menores de 16 años como parte de una estrategia de protección frente a los riesgos digitales. La medida, que afecta de lleno a plataformas como X, propiedad de Musk, fue duramente criticada por el magnate.

A través de su propia red social, Musk calificó a Sánchez con términos como “fascista”, “totalitario”, “tirano” o “traidor”, utilizando un lenguaje especialmente agresivo que no pasó desapercibido.

La denunciante, que menciona contactos con Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Ferguson y Leon Black, también describe haber visto indicios de actividades inapropiadas en la casa de Epstein y haberse marchado perturbada.

Durante su trabajo en Minneapolis, acompañó a activistas contrarios a esta agencia en labores de vigilancia ciudadana y fue testigo directo de una detención que tuvo consecuencias inmediatas para una menor de once años, cuya madre fue arrestada mientras ella quedaba sola y desprotegida.

Pastor relató cómo, tras la detención, la niña tuvo que refugiarse en casa de una vecina en plena nevada, portando una carpeta con documentos para explicar que su madre había sido arrestada. El equipo periodístico y los voluntarios intentaron activar mecanismos de ayuda para garantizar la seguridad de la menor, evidenciando la fragilidad en la que quedan muchas familias inmigrantes tras este tipo de actuaciones.

Según el Boletín Hidrológico del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica, los embalses peninsulares se sitúan en el 67,3% de su capacidad, lo que supone un incremento de 8,1 puntos en apenas siete días. Esta cifra está más de 14 puntos por encima de la media de la última década y supera ampliamente los registros habituales para esta época del año.

Hasta 31 pantanos han alcanzado el 100% de su capacidad, lo que ha obligado a realizar desembalses controlados en varias cuencas para garantizar la seguridad de las infraestructuras. El mes de enero ha sido clave en esta recuperación: ha resultado el más lluvioso de los últimos 25 años en la España peninsular, con un 85% más de precipitaciones de lo normal según la Aemet.

El evento, que pretendía debatir sobre la Guerra Civil Española con un enfoque de reconciliación y equidistancia, generó polémica desde el principio por su título (inicialmente más provocador en borrador) y por la participación de figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros. Varios participantes de izquierdas, como el escritor David Uclés, Antonio Maíllo (IU) y otros, renunciaron al considerar el planteamiento sesgado o inadecuado. Pérez-Reverte y la fundación atribuyeron la suspensión al 'sectarismo' y 'cobardía' de la izquierda (moderada y radical), incluyendo críticas en redes de Podemos, y anunciaron el aplazamiento a octubre manteniendo el título.

Pena, residente en Estados Unidos desde 2009, se había posicionado públicamente a favor de las políticas migratorias más restrictivas del presidente Donald Trump, defendiendo redadas, deportaciones rápidas y la criminalización de migrantes. En sus contenidos, diferenciaba entre 'criminales' —a quienes según él iba dirigida la represión— y el resto, pidiendo calma a la comunidad brasileña ante las primeras oleadas de detenciones del nuevo mandato.

La detención se produjo por no presentarse a una vista judicial relacionada con su propio estatus migratorio, según confirmaron fuentes cercanas al Brazilian Times y The Guardian. No hubo excepciones por su afinidad ideológica con la administración Trump: la maquinaria migratoria actuó de forma impersonal.

La reseña fue escrita por Paige Rolland, una adolescente que utilizó la plataforma literaria Wattpad para dar su opinión, sin emplear insultos ni lenguaje ofensivo. Pese a ello, Brittain se obsesionó con el comentario y decidió tomar represalias.

Tras investigar la vida de la joven a través de redes sociales, el autor viajó cerca de 600 kilómetros desde Bedford, en Inglaterra, hasta Glenrothes, en Escocia, donde Rolland trabajaba en un supermercado. Una vez allí, la atacó por la espalda con una botella de vino mientras ella se encontraba desempeñando su labor.

El resultado es un episodio de precipitaciones continuas y muy intensas que llega en el peor momento posible: con el suelo ya completamente saturado.

Los modelos meteorológicos prevén acumulados semanales de entre 100 y 150 mm en amplias zonas, con picos que pueden alcanzar los 300 mm en regiones como Galicia, Extremadura y Andalucía.

Según un medio británico, los visitantes pueden llegar a pagar precios desorbitados por bebidas y entradas a discotecas, lo que ha llevado a muchos a buscar alternativas más económicas sin renunciar al ambiente festivo. Una de estas alternativas es Zrce, en la isla croata de Pag, que se está consolidando como el nuevo epicentro europeo de la fiesta. La playa ofrece festivales internacionales y clubes abiertos las 24 horas, como Papaya, Aquarius, Noa, Kalypso y Euphoria, con DJ de renombre. La gran ventaja de Zrce frente a Ibiza es el coste: vuelos directos desde Reino Unido desde 21 libras, entradas a discotecas gratuitas antes de medianoche o por menos de 10 euros, y bebidas mucho más asequibles.

El caso reciente de una concejala del PP que recorrió 50 km solo para gritar un insulto al presidente del Gobierno evidencia que este tipo de conductas se están naturalizando como si fueran parte de la libertad de expresión o del debate político. Sin embargo, la realidad es que se trata de violencia verbal que degrada la democracia y deshumaniza a los adversarios políticos. El silencio o la tibieza frente a estas acciones contribuyen a que el odio se infiltre en la vida política y social, afectando la convivencia democrática. Además, el programa vincula este fenómeno con otros asuntos de actualidad, como las revelaciones de los 3,5 millones de documentos del caso Epstein y su impacto en figuras políticas y empresariales, y con la regularización masiva de migrantes en España, donde los datos contradicen la idea de un 'efecto llamada' negativo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-del-insulto-y-el-discurso-de-odio-en-la-politica-espanola</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-del-insulto-y-el-discurso-de-odio-en-la-politica-espanola</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rybakina se impone a Sabalenka en el Open de Australia con juego firme y discreto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo relata la final del Open de Australia entre Aryna Sabalenka y Elena Rybakina, destacando la diferencia de estilo entre ambas. Sabalenka, número 1, exhibió su habitual potencia y presencia mediática con un llamativo outfit y joyería, reflejando su carácter explosivo dentro y fuera de la pista. En contraste, Rybakina, número 5, mostró una postura más discreta y sobria, vestida de tonos neutros y sin ostentaciones.

Los correos electrónicos mencionan a una empresaria emiratí, Aziza Al-Ahmadi, y a un individuo identificado como Abdullah Al-Maari, presuntamente residentes en Arabia Saudí.

Las palabras de Feijóo, formuladas en forma de pregunta sobre si el diputado vasco poseía información relativa a los asesinatos de la banda, fueron interpretadas por Matute como el uso del conocido “comodín de ETA” en el debate político.

Maestre denuncia que estas muertes no fueron inevitables ni fruto del caos, sino consecuencia directa de decisiones políticas concretas tomadas por la Consejería de Sanidad madrileña bajo el gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Esta afirmación, que choca con la Constitución estadounidense —que reserva la gestión de las elecciones a los estados y autoridades locales—, se enmarca en su persistente narrativa sobre supuestos fraudes electorales, sin pruebas concluyentes, especialmente respecto a su derrota en 2020 frente a Joe Biden.

Las declaraciones llegan poco después de un allanamiento del FBI en una oficina electoral del condado de Fulton (Georgia), un foco habitual de las teorías de Trump.

Eso es lo que ha ocurrido durante años con los correos electrónicos vinculados a Jeffrey Epstein, difundidos en internet a través de archivos PDF escaneados, documentos de texto e imágenes procedentes de procesos judiciales y divulgaciones oficiales. La dispersión y el formato poco amigable de estos materiales han dificultado su consulta sistemática por parte de periodistas, investigadores y ciudadanos.

Un nuevo proyecto web llamado Jmail propone una solución centrada en la usabilidad. En lugar de presentar los correos como archivos sueltos, la plataforma recrea una interfaz similar a Gmail, organizada en bandejas de entrada y salida, hilos de conversación y un buscador interno. Todo el contenido que muestra procede exclusivamente de material ya público; no añade información nueva ni ofrece acceso a datos privados.

Según el estudio HBSC-2022, que analiza los comportamientos sexuales de jóvenes escolarizados de entre 15 y 18 años, el 34,8 % ha mantenido relaciones sexuales coitales, una cifra similar entre chicos y chicas. Sin embargo, el uso del preservativo ha descendido de forma significativa en las dos últimas décadas: desde 2002 ha caído 18 puntos, situándose en el 65,5 % en 2022.

El descenso es especialmente acusado entre las adolescentes de 15 y 16 años, donde en solo cuatro años el uso del condón se ha reducido casi 16 puntos. Esta tendencia ha ampliado la brecha de género: mientras el 70,6 % de los chicos utilizó preservativo en su última relación sexual, solo lo hizo el 60,8 % de las chicas.

La pieza audiovisual se presenta como una excursión por lo que Abascal define como “el corazón del Pirineo”, con un tono divulgativo y cercano al medio natural.

Durante el recorrido, grabado en un entorno invernal con abundante nieve, Abascal y sus acompañantes avanzan por la montaña mientras comentan aspectos relacionados con la flora y la fauna de la zona. En varios momentos intentan identificar especies de árboles y aves, con dudas entre álamos, abedules, hayas o arces, y mencionan el uso de aplicaciones móviles para ayudar en la identificación.

El comando Txikia excavó un túnel bajo la vía por la que pasaba diariamente el almirante tras asistir a misa y colocó 75 kilos de explosivos que hicieron volar el vehículo Dodge Dart, matando a Carrero, su chófer y su escolta. ETA reivindicó inmediatamente la acción como venganza por ejecuciones de militantes vascos y en pro de la liberación nacional vasca, negando cualquier colaboración externa.

El texto destaca el impacto del magnicidio: desestabilizó el franquismo tardío, facilitó indirectamente la Transición democrática al eliminar a una figura clave del continuismo ultraconservador y evidenció que el régimen no estaba 'atado y bien atado'. Tras el atentado, se nombró a Carlos Arias Navarro como sucesor, lo que intensificó la repres]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-atentado-de-eta-contra-carrero-blanco-y-las-persistentes-teorias-sobre-la-posible-implicacion-de-la-cia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-atentado-de-eta-contra-carrero-blanco-y-las-persistentes-teorias-sobre-la-posible-implicacion-de-la-cia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Onda abre un parque infantil inspirado en la tradición taurina para el ocio familiar]]></title><description><![CDATA[El municipio de Onda ha inaugurado un nuevo parque infantil temático inspirado en la tradición taurina, concebido como un espacio lúdico y seguro destinado al disfrute de niños y niñas. La iniciativa, impulsada por el Ayuntamiento, busca acercar las fiestas y símbolos culturales locales a las nuevas generaciones a través del juego, la convivencia y el respeto, integrando tradición y ocio en un entorno accesible.

Durante el acto inaugural, la alcaldesa de Onda, Carmina Ballester, destacó que este parque pretende mantener viva una parte esencial de la identidad del municipio, fomentando al mismo tiempo valores como la socialización y el uso compartido del espacio público. El parque cuenta con diversos elementos de juego adaptados a edades infantiles, entre los que se incluyen un cadafal con tobogán, una pequeña plaza de toros, barreras, figuras de toro y vaca, así como juegos de muelle anclados al suelo.

El primero garantiza la revalorización de las pensiones y recoge otras medidas vinculadas a la Seguridad Social, como las cuotas de los autónomos o el Ingreso Mínimo Vital. El segundo agrupa el resto del denominado escudo social, que incluye el bono energético, ayudas por la dana, bonificaciones fiscales y la prórroga de la moratoria antidesahucios.

La decisión de dividir el paquete en dos textos responde a las presiones políticas cruzadas dentro del bloque parlamentario que sostiene al Ejecutivo. Tanto el PP como Junts exigían que la subida de las pensiones se aprobara por separado, mientras que las fuerzas de izquierda defendían mantener intacto el conjunto de medidas sociales. El punto más conflictivo ha sido la moratoria de los desahucios, que Junts y el PNV consideran perjudicial para los pequeños propietarios.

La denuncia acusaba al exlíder socialista de delitos de narcotráfico, blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, supuestamente derivados de su relación política y personal con el expresidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro.

El magistrado instructor, Antonio Piña, adoptó esta decisión tras analizar un informe contundente de la Fiscalía Antidroga, que calificó la querella como un conjunto de “conjeturas, suposiciones y deducciones infundadas”. Tanto el juez como el ministerio público subrayan que en todo el escrito de Hazte Oír no aparece ni un solo indicio concreto, dato verificable o prueba que permita sostener las graves acusaciones formuladas contra Zapatero.

Durante su intervención en el World Governments Summit celebrado en Dubái, Sánchez aseguró que España prohibirá el acceso a las redes sociales a los menores de 16 años, obligando a las plataformas a implantar sistemas efectivos de verificación de edad. Esta medida se enmarca en el proyecto de ley de protección de los menores en los entornos digitales, actualmente en tramitación parlamentaria, y sigue la estela de iniciativas similares adoptadas en otros países europeos como Francia o Portugal.

El cambio principal consiste en eximir a los propietarios de una sola vivienda en alquiler —o de dos propiedades cuando una sea la residencia habitual— de la obligación de ofrecer una alternativa habitacional a los inquilinos vulnerables en caso de impago.

Según explica el PNV, esta modificación responde a una reivindicación sostenida por el grupo parlamentario vasco, que considera que la normativa anterior equiparaba injustamente a pequeños arrendadores con grandes tenedores o fondos de inversión. A juicio de la formación, esa equiparación trasladaba una carga económica excesiva a personas que dependen del alquiler de un único piso como complemento de renta o ahorro, obligándolas a asumir largos periodos de impago sin capacidad real de respuesta.

Varios interesados relatan que, al intentar comprar pisos de la urbanización Les Naus, se les exigieron cantidades muy superiores al precio máximo legal, con una parte importante del pago en dinero negro para esquivar la normativa autonómica.

Una de las afectadas explica que contactó con una inmobiliaria tras ver un anuncio en un portal especializado y que le solicitaron 227.000 euros declarados y otros 223.000 en efectivo, una cifra que considera desorbitada. Según su testimonio, desde la propia agencia se normalizó esta práctica con frases como “esto es España”. Otros compradores potenciales confirman experiencias similares, con peticiones de contratos privados y entregas de grandes sumas en metálico antes de la firma oficial.

Sin embargo, esta afirmación es falsa: los extranjeros que obtengan ahora un permiso de residencia deberán esperar cinco años para poder votar, y únicamente podrían ejercer este derecho en elecciones municipales si su país de origen tiene un convenio de reciprocidad con España.

Draghi destacó que en los ámbitos donde la UE ya actúa de forma federalizada —como el comercio, la competencia, el mercado único y la política monetaria— es tratada como una potencia global y logra negociar en igualdad de condiciones, citando acuerdos comerciales exitosos con India, América Latina o el Mercosur.

Además de la multa económica, el regulador ha prohibido a determinadas sociedades del grupo presentarse a licitaciones públicas para el suministro de gasóleo A durante un periodo de seis meses.

Según la CNMC, Repsol, que ostentaba una posición de dominio en el mercado mayorista nacional de combustibles para automoción, incurrió en una práctica de estrechamiento de márgenes.

Por un lado, los mensajes obtenidos de la plataforma de mensajería cifrada SkyECC —desmantelada en 2021 tras una operación policial franco-belga— llegaron a España filtrados por distintas autoridades, sin que ni las defensas ni el propio tribunal tuvieran acceso a los archivos originales.

Según los expertos en seguridad y el proveedor de hosting, el ataque no se originó por vulnerabilidades en el código de Notepad++, sino por un fallo en el servidor que permitió el acceso a credenciales internas. El actor detrás del ataque fue probablemente un grupo patrocinado por el Estado chino, focalizándose específicamente en Notepad++. Tras la detección, el proveedor migró todos los clientes a un nuevo servidor y aplicó mejoras de seguridad, incluyendo la rotación de credenciales y la corrección de vulnerabilidades.

Según el autor, esta lectura geopolítica es en gran medida ilusoria y oculta las verdaderas motivaciones económicas del acuerdo. Las negociaciones, iniciadas en 2007 y retomadas en 2022, responden sobre todo al intento europeo de reproducir el modelo que durante dos décadas vinculó a la UE con China: acceso a un gran mercado en expansión, exportaciones de productos de alta gama y aprovechamiento de mano de obra barata.

Desde esta perspectiva, la India aparece como un sustituto de China tras el agotamiento del llamado “momento chino”, que benefició especialmente al capitalismo alemán pero dejó importantes costes sociales e industriales en otros países europeos.

A lo largo de la narrativa, el protagonista se enfrenta a la disyuntiva de ser genuino o dejarse llevar por las expectativas del público, mientras personajes como 'Judas', que aparenta ser un purista pero en realidad es puro postureo, lo acompañan en este viaje hacia la fama.

Según los últimos datos anunciados por el Carter Center, en 2025 solo se han registrado 10 casos humanos en todo el mundo, la cifra más baja desde que comenzó el programa internacional de erradicación en 1986. De confirmarse estos datos, esta parasitosis podría convertirse en la segunda enfermedad humana erradicada de la historia, tras la viruela.

El gusano de Guinea es un nematodo que se transmite a través del consumo de agua contaminada con pequeños crustáceos que portan sus larvas. Tras infectar a la persona, el parásito migra por el cuerpo y, aproximadamente un año después, emerge lentamente por la piel a través de una ampolla extremadamente dolorosa, normalmente en piernas o pies. El proceso puede prolongarse durante semanas y conlleva un alto riesgo de infecciones secundarias, sepsis y discapacidad temporal o permanente.

La operación, desarrollada este lunes, se ha saldado con al menos seis personas detenidas y varias más investigadas. Entre los arrestados figuran varios trabajadores de la propia estación de ITV y, de forma especialmente relevante, un agente de la Guardia Civil, aunque por el momento no se ha detallado públicamente el grado de implicación de este último en los hechos.

Según la investigación, el entramado certificaba de manera fraudulenta reparaciones que en realidad no se habían llevado a cabo, permitiendo que vehículos en mal estado y con graves carencias técnicas superaran la inspección obligatoria. Esta práctica suponía un riesgo directo para la seguridad vial, al permitir la circulación de coches que no cumplían las condiciones mínimas exigidas para circular por las carreteras.

La actriz y presentadora acudió al programa televisivo ‘¡De viernes!’ para aclarar cómo fue su trato con Epstein y contextualizar una relación que, según sus palabras, se limitó al ámbito personal y de amistad.

Obregón explicó que conoció a Epstein a comienzos de los años ochenta en Nueva York a través de un amigo común, cuando ella residía en la ciudad por motivos de estudios y trabajo. En aquel momento, Epstein era presentado como un empresario atractivo y bien relacionado. La actriz relató que durante ese periodo llegó a alojarse en su casa durante dos semanas, insistiendo en que no mantuvieron una relación sentimental ni sexual.

Se trata de una iniciativa poco habitual en aerolíneas occidentales, pero más alineada con las estrategias de otras grandes compañías del Golfo, como Qatar Airways o las aerolíneas saudíes, que utilizan este tipo de infraestructuras como herramienta clave para atraer y retener talento en un mercado laboral altamente competitivo.

El complejo estará ubicado en el Dubai Investments Park, una zona estratégica próxima tanto al actual aeropuerto internacional de Dubái, donde opera Emirates, como al futuro Al Maktoum International Airport, al que la aerolínea prevé trasladar sus operaciones en los próximos años.

Tradicionalmente centrado en el televisor del salón, el tiempo libre se organizaba alrededor de rutinas familiares y espacios compartidos. Hoy, el ocio se ha desplazado al ámbito digital y personal, principalmente a través de móviles y pantallas individuales. Aunque los españoles siguen disfrutando de entre cuatro y media y seis horas diarias de ocio, su consumo se ha fragmentado en microintervalos llenos de estímulos constantes, desde redes sociales y videojuegos hasta plataformas de streaming como Netflix. Este cambio no solo afecta al entretenimiento pasivo, sino también a la socialización, la identidad y la pertenencia, especialmente entre jóvenes y menores, que dedican gran parte de su tiempo libre a TikTok, YouTube y juegos online.

El precio de la vivienda de segunda mano ha aumentado un 20,4% interanual en enero, el mayor incremento registrado en las dos últimas décadas. Este encarecimiento sitúa el precio medio de venta en 2.897 euros por metro cuadrado, lo que supone que un piso tipo de 80 metros cuadrados alcance un coste aproximado de 231.700 euros, muy cerca de los máximos históricos previos al estallido de la burbuja inmobiliaria de 2007.

La vivienda nueva tampoco ofrece alivio, ya que cerró 2025 con un aumento cercano al 9%, consolidando una tendencia generalizada de subidas en todo el mercado residencial.

Su padre, Antonio Ascari, falleció en 1925 a los 37 años en un accidente durante el Gran Premio de Francia en Montlhéry, cuando Alberto tenía solo siete años. Ciccio, como se le conocía por su complexión robusta, heredó el talento de su progenitor y debutó en el motociclismo en 1936, logrando victorias con marcas como Gilera y Bianchi. En 1940 condujo el primer Ferrari en la Mille Miglia, aunque un fallo mecánico lo retiró pronto.

Tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Ascari brilló en competiciones como el GP de Módena (1947) y se unió a Ferrari, donde ganó los títulos mundiales de Fórmula 1 en 1952 y 1953 con una superioridad aplastante, incluyendo un récord de 75 % de victorias en una temporada que aún se mantiene.

Gorbachov, convencido del ideal comunista y preocupado por la decadencia económica, militar y tecnológica de la URSS, impulsó profundas reformas mediante la Perestroika y la Glasnost. Aunque bienintencionadas, estas políticas precipitaron la desintegración del sistema soviético, la pérdida de sus satélites en Europa del Este y la fragmentación del país en quince repúblicas independientes, con graves consecuencias económicas y sociales que todavía se sienten.

Mucho antes de la llegada de exploradores europeos con cámaras e instrumentos, comunidades como los inuit, los sámi o los chukchi habían desarrollado sociedades complejas adaptadas a un entorno extremo, basadas en la caza, la pesca, la movilidad estacional y un conocimiento profundo del hielo, el clima y los animales.

Uno de los ejes centrales del texto es la figura de William Bradford, pintor y fotógrafo estadounidense que publicó en 1873 la obra “The Arctic Regions”, un volumen monumental financiado en parte por la reina Victoria y editado en una tirada muy limitada.

Los vehículos más modernos alcanzan incluso el 91% de su autonomía tras recorrer 241.000 km, gracias a mejoras en la química de las baterías, sistemas de gestión térmica y estrategias de eficiencia.

La decisión se tomó a finales de 2025 ante la expiración del contrato anterior y la imposibilidad de interrumpir un servicio esencial para miles de personas en situación de dependencia o vulnerabilidad social.

El SAD es uno de los mayores contratos sociales del consistorio. Para el año 2026 cuenta con un presupuesto inicial de 90 millones de euros, pero las cláusulas incluidas permiten duplicar su vigencia durante 2027, elevando la cifra total a 180 millones. Además, se contempla una prórroga extraordinaria de nueve meses que podría añadir otros 40 millones, por lo que el Ayuntamiento ha provisionado hasta 221 millones de euros para cubrir el conjunto del servicio.

Además, el partido morado reclama modificaciones legales para reducir los plazos de acceso a la nacionalidad española, los cuales actualmente son de diez años para la mayoría de los casos, aunque se reducen a dos años para países con convenios de reciprocidad y varios países latinoamericanos. Podemos también exige el cierre de los Centros de Internamiento de Extranjeros (CIE) y el fin de redadas racistas.

Originalmente pensado como un adorno alegre para celebrar el Año del Caballo, el error en la costura de la boca convirtió al 'caballo llorón' en un símbolo inesperado de los trabajadores sobrecargados y poco valorados. Muchos jóvenes empleados en China, que soportan largas jornadas bajo la cultura laboral '996' (de 9 a.m. a 9 p.m., seis días a la semana), se identifican con la expresión del peluche, utilizándolo en memes y publicaciones para expresar su agotamiento y frustración. La tienda de Yiwu que lo fabrica ha visto cómo los pedidos se disparaban, obligando a ampliar la producción, y el juguete ha comenzado a venderse también en otras regiones de Asia, África y Oriente Medio.

La agencia, que recientemente incorporó a 12.000 nuevos agentes, enfrenta problemas administrativos que han llevado a que personal de primera línea recurra a Reddit para relatar sus dificultades. Entre las quejas, destacan la imposibilidad de cubrir gastos médicos para hijos enfermos y la ausencia de los bonos prometidos. Los sueldos, que según el nivel y la experiencia podrían variar entre 51.600 y 84.000 dólares anuales para oficiales de deportación de nivel inicial, incluyen incentivos adicionales, como horas extras, seguros y bonos de firma, muchos de los cuales no se han materializado.

Además, parte del dinero anunciado incluye fondos adeudados de 2025 y la primera cuota de 2026. Por tanto, no se trata de un aporte excepcional del Ejecutivo. La distribución de los $100.810 millones se reparte entre 1.062 cuarteles, unos $95 millones por asociación, un monto insuficiente considerando que un solo traje forestal cuesta más de $5.000.

Según explicó, conoció a Epstein a través de un amigo común que insistió en presentarle al que entonces era considerado un atractivo y exitoso soltero. Obregón relató que llegaron a mantener una relación de amistad cercana y que, en un momento complicado para ella, llegó a vivir dos semanas en su casa tras incendiarse su apartamento.

Según la información facilitada por los servicios de emergencia y recogida por Europa Press, los hechos ocurrieron en torno a las 10.00 horas en una vivienda situada en la calle Constitución.

La víctima fue atacada por dos personas desconocidas que la rociaron con un líquido abrasivo y la golpearon de forma reiterada, causándole fracturas en la mandíbula y en las extremidades superiores, así como quemaduras de segundo y tercer grado en aproximadamente el 40% de su cuerpo.

La receptora, Carme, sufrió una grave necrosis facial provocada por una infección bacteriana que destruyó gran parte de los tejidos de su rostro y le impidió realizar funciones básicas como comer, hablar o respirar con normalidad. Tras años de aislamiento y deterioro físico y emocional, el trasplante supuso para ella una oportunidad real de recuperar calidad de vida.

La intervención, de carácter parcial, ha sido especialmente compleja y ha contado con la participación de cerca de un centenar de profesionales de distintas especialidades médicas.

Aunque la Consejería de Salud había negado deficiencias, los testimonios de varias pacientes de hospitales como el HUCA en Oviedo, Cabueñes en Gijón y Valle del Nalón en Langreo evidencian lo contrario, incluyendo casos de consultas retrasadas meses que derivaron en cirugías posteriores.

A pesar de haber actuado correctamente y llamar al personal para que limpiara el derrame, la empresa la acusó de haber sustraído bienes sin autorización y la despidió por 'causa justificada'.

El caso ha generado polémica y los sindicatos, como la CGIL, han calificado la situación como absurda y desproporcionada, destacando que la trabajadora actuó con total corrección. Se ha iniciado un proceso legal para impugnar el despido, y se espera que la sentencia se dicte a mediados de marzo.

Ventura, que quedó segundo en la primera vuelta con cerca de un cuarto de los votos, ha conseguido en seis años que Chega pase de tener un único diputado a ser la principal fuerza de oposición, gracias a su discurso contra la inmigración, ciertos colectivos minoritarios y la corrupción gubernamental.

Ese día entraron en la cafetería Woolworth’s de Greensboro y se sentaron en una barra reservada exclusivamente a personas blancas, desafiando de forma directa las leyes y normas sociales que sostenían la segregación racial en el sur del país.

La reacción fue inmediata: el personal se negó a atenderlos y algunos clientes los increparon, pero los jóvenes permanecieron sentados de manera pacífica hasta el cierre del local, anunciando que volverían al día siguiente.

Aunque el jugador percibe cada giro como un evento imprevisible, el resultado de las partidas está regido por un diseño algorítmico muy preciso que define pérdidas y ganancias a largo plazo. En ese sistema destacan tres variables clave: el RTP, la volatilidad y la ganancia máxima.

El RTP (Return to Player) indica el porcentaje teórico del dinero apostado que la máquina devuelve a los jugadores tras millones de tiradas. No es una promesa de equilibrio inmediato ni garantiza resultados en sesiones concretas, sino una media estadística a largo plazo. En Europa, los valores habituales oscilan entre el 94 % y el 97 %, mientras que otros mercados fijan porcentajes más bajos como herramienta de control regulatorio.

A los problemas estructurales propios de la actividad se suma una combinación de factores que, según los profesionales, hacen inviable mantener las explotaciones. Entre ellos destaca la lucha constante contra la varroa, un parásito que provoca una elevada mortandad en las colmenas y obliga a dedicar gran parte del esfuerzo a la repoblación en lugar de a la producción de miel o polen.

A esta dificultad sanitaria se añade el impacto del cambio climático, que ha reducido de forma drástica la producción y ha elevado las pérdidas por encima del 40%.

En uno de los mensajes, enviado en mayo de 2017, Summers pregunta por el grado de culpabilidad de Trump y plantea la posibilidad de una ayuda rusa en las elecciones de 2016, una hipótesis que considera plausible aunque no segura. Epstein responde con un comentario despectivo, afirmando que el entorno de Trump no comprende hasta qué punto es 'realmente tonto'.

Otros correos previos, de octubre de 2016, recogen preguntas de Summers sobre supuestos hábitos de consumo de drogas de Trump, a lo que Epstein responde negándolo tajantemente. En julio de 2017, Summers califica a una persona no identificada como mentalmente enferma, y Epstein aclara que no se trata de un amigo suyo.

Situado en la Travessera de Gràcia, el negocio se ha visto obligado a bajar la persiana después de que la propiedad planteara duplicar la renta mensual hasta alcanzar los 3.000 euros, una cifra que la actual responsable del horno considera inasumible.

El cierre fue comunicado a la clientela el pasado viernes por Montse Clos, que llevaba más de dos décadas al frente del establecimiento. Durante este tiempo, el horno no solo ha sido un comercio de proximidad, sino también un actor activo en la vida social y cultural del barrio, participando habitualmente en iniciativas como el concurso de escaparates de Sant Medir. Su desaparición ha generado una fuerte reacción entre vecinos y entidades locales, que lamentan la pérdida de un negocio histórico muy arraigado al tejido comunitario.

La iniciativa conecta las soluciones existentes mediante un hub central de interoperabilidad, que permitirá a los consumidores seguir utilizando sus plataformas habituales mientras los comerciantes podrán aceptar pagos europeos de manera sencilla. La colaboración abarca 13 países europeos, representando aproximadamente el 72% de la población de la UE y Noruega, y está abierta a otros mercados europeos, incluso no pertenecientes al euro.

El documento propone que los trabajadores posean o gestionen al menos un 2 % del capital de las empresas, un umbral que se elevaría hasta el 10 % en el caso de las grandes corporaciones. Además, plantea una mayor presencia de los empleados en los consejos de administración: un tercio de los asientos en empresas de entre 50 y 1.000 trabajadores y hasta la mitad en aquellas que superen ese tamaño.

La vicepresidenta segunda y ministra de Trabajo, Yolanda Díaz, ha anunciado que el Gobierno impulsará una ley basada en estas recomendaciones y abrirá una mesa de diálogo social para su desarrollo.

Las localidades afectadas incluyen Santiago de Compostela, Ourense, Sada, Lugo y Gondomar. En los locales aparecieron carteles acusando al partido de ser un 'partido pirómano' en relación con la gestión de la crisis de incendios que afectó principalmente a las provincias de Ourense y Lugo, donde ardieron unas 170.000 hectáreas, la mayor ola de incendios registrada en Galicia. Los carteles, que no llevan firma de ninguna organización, acusan al PP de implementar políticas que han contribuido a la catástrofe medioambiental y critican su enfoque anticlimático. Aunque el PP ha vinculado estos actos a Galiza Nova, las juventudes del BNG han negado cualquier implicación.

Según el portavoz socialista en el Parlament, Iago Negueruela, el apartamento cuesta alrededor de 160 euros la noche y, con un promedio de 255 días alquilados al año, podría generar unos 38.760 euros de forma irregular. Los socialistas critican que, mientras el PP anuncia restricciones al alquiler vacacional, permite que pisos turísticos plurifamiliares operen sin regulación, agravando el problema del acceso a la vivienda para residentes. Negueruela señala también a la presidenta del Govern, Marga Prohens, por “blanquear” a Airbnb durante su presencia en FITUR, mientras los ciudadanos enfrentan aumentos de alquileres superiores al 100%, lo que obliga a muchos a alquilar habitaciones en lugar de pisos completos.

Los profesionales de cuidados paliativos recomendaron a la familia contar con una persona de apoyo para asistirle en tareas básicas como la higiene, la alimentación o la medicación, ya que su esposa era la única cuidadora permanente.

La solicitud de la ayuda se presentó a finales de noviembre ante los servicios sociales de Leganés.

Según los escritos judiciales, el liderazgo eclesiástico, incluidos familiares directos del acusado, fomentó una cultura de silencio y protección institucional que facilitó los abusos a al menos 11 menores.

Zachary Radcliff, de 30 años, fue apartado de su cargo en octubre de 2024 tras salir a la luz denuncias por abusos contra 10 niños y una niña. Posteriormente, fue enviado a juicio con 60 cargos, entre ellos 17 por conducta sexual criminal en primer grado, delitos que podrían acarrearle cadena perpetua.

El acto se celebrará a las 18:30 horas en el Centro Cívico Julián Besteiro, situado en la Avenida Rey Juan Carlos I, y está concebido como un encuentro abierto entre creadores, público y personas directamente vinculadas al contexto humano de la obra.

El cómic destaca por una narrativa visual intensa que busca interpelar al lector y generar reflexión. A través de la ilustración y el relato gráfico, '7291' propone una aproximación íntima a temas relacionados con la memoria, el testimonio y la justicia social, apostando por una mirada humana que trasciende lo puramente artístico. La imagen promocional del evento refuerza este tono reflexivo y anticipa el enfoque sensible del proyecto.

El eje central del programa lo forman los submarinos S-80, desarrollados por Navantia, que incorporan tecnologías avanzadas como la propulsión independiente del aire, sensores de nueva generación y mayores capacidades de sigilo y autonomía.

El magistrado Antonio Piña, titular del Tribunal Central de Instancia, concluye que los hechos denunciados no presentan relevancia penal suficiente para iniciar un procedimiento judicial.

Según el auto judicial, la querella se apoya fundamentalmente en informaciones procedentes de fuentes abiertas y artículos periodísticos, sin aportar indicios racionales de criminalidad ni hechos concretos que vinculen a Zapatero con los delitos imputados. El juez subraya que no se puede confundir la sospecha, la creencia personal o la opinión popular con la existencia de hechos delictivos probados, requisito imprescindible para abrir una causa penal.

A principios de noviembre de 2025, soldados israelíes colocaron un aviso en el recinto deportivo anunciando su derribo, alegando que está ubicado en terreno militar y carece de los permisos necesarios. Sin embargo, las autoridades locales aseguran que el terreno está arrendado desde hace dos décadas al Patriarcado armenio de Jerusalén.

El campo, en uso desde hace siete años, es el único espacio abierto de ocio del campamento y da servicio a más de 250 niños y jóvenes de entre 6 y 19 años, incluidos equipos femeninos y varias jugadoras que forman parte de la selección nacional palestina. Para una población de más de 7.200 personas hacinadas en apenas 0,071 kilómetros cuadrados, este espacio cumple una función esencial no solo deportiva, sino también social y psicológica.

Feijóo ha insistido en que Mazón actuó conforme a la información de la que disponía en ese momento y ha señalado directamente al Gobierno central y a los organismos estatales como responsables de no haber facilitado datos suficientes y precisos sobre la magnitud del episodio meteorológico.

Según el dirigente popular, la delegada del Gobierno indicó que el fenómeno se desplazaba hacia Albacete y desde el Ejecutivo central se transmitió que no se esperaba una situación especialmente grave.

La pareja de Ayuso ha solicitado al Tribunal Supremo que García Ortiz abone 64.778 euros correspondientes a los honorarios de su abogado durante la tramitación de la causa, cantidad que multiplica por cuatro la sanción económica que ya había sido impuesta por el tribunal. El Supremo condenó previamente a García Ortiz a dos años de inhabilitación para ejercer en la Fiscalía y a una multa de 7.200 euros junto a la obligación de indemnizar con 10.000 euros a Alberto González Amador, debido a la filtración de un correo sobre fraude fiscal de un comisionista.

Rufián ha acusado a Feijóo de difundir varias 'mentiras flagrantes' en su comparecencia y ha ido desgranándolas una a una ante los miembros de la comisión.

Según Rufián, una de las principales falsedades consiste en afirmar que la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar no emitió avisos previos al desastre.

Lejos de ser un acto de desesperación, esta técnica requería un control absoluto del aparato y un profundo conocimiento de la aerodinámica. Existen varias modalidades de tarán: el impacto con la hélice, que busca destruir la cola del enemigo; el tarán de ala, donde se golpea el ala o superficies de control; el uso del tren de aterrizaje para dañar al adversario sin comprometer el fuselaje propio; y la embestida de fuselaje, último recurso extremadamente peligroso. Históricamente, pilotos como Pyotr Nesterov, Alexander Kazakov, Viktor Talalikhin, Yekaterina Zelenko, Amet-Khan Sultan y otros llevaron a cabo estas maniobras en conflictos del siglo XX, desde la Primera Guerra Mundial hasta la Guerra Fría, demostrando audacia y precisión excepcionales.

Con una pensión mensual cercana a los 2.000 euros, Miguel Ángel vivía de forma independiente hasta que la subida sostenida de los precios del alquiler hizo inviable mantener su vivienda en solitario.

Según explica, hace tres años pagaba 660 euros por un piso situado en la periferia de la ciudad, una cantidad que suponía aproximadamente un tercio de sus ingresos y que podía asumir sin grandes dificultades. Sin embargo, en ese periodo el alquiler se incrementó alrededor de un 23%, alcanzando los 830 euros mensuales. Este aumento provocó que el gasto en vivienda pasara a representar casi la mitad de su pensión, una proporción que compromete seriamente su estabilidad económica.

El líder del Partido Popular evitó asumir responsabilidades políticas en relación con sus comunicaciones con el presidente valenciano, Carlos Mazón, y centró gran parte de sus respuestas en criticar al Gobierno central y a la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar. Esta estrategia provocó el malestar de varios diputados y, de forma destacada, la intervención reiterada de la presidenta de la comisión, Carmen Martínez.

El momento más tenso se produjo durante el intercambio con el diputado de EH Bildu, Oskar Matute. Ante una pregunta directa sobre si había amparado la actuación del presidente autonómico durante la tragedia, Feijóo desvió la respuesta hacia cuestiones ajenas a la DANA, introduciendo referencias a ETA y vinculando a Matute con el entorno de la izquierda abertzale.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la mañana del sábado 31 de enero y han generado una fuerte reacción social en una ciudad especialmente sensible a las cuestiones de convivencia y diversidad cultural.

Según el testimonio difundido públicamente en nombre del agente afectado, el guardia civil se encontraba desayunando con su familia cuando varios policías nacionales, sentados en una mesa cercana, comenzaron a proferir insultos en voz alta. Entre las expresiones denunciadas figuran calificativos racistas y deshumanizantes como 'mono' y 'chimpancé', además de una amenaza explícita de agresión física.

El llamado “Great Healthcare Plan” se reduce a un PDF de apenas dos páginas y carece de medidas concretas capaces de abordar los problemas estructurales de la sanidad estadounidense, un sector que consume cerca del 17% del PIB. Según el autor, el plan se limita a reciclar ideas clásicas del ideario republicano que ya han demostrado ser ineficaces o impopulares.

La propuesta se apoya en tres pilares principales. El primero es la reducción del precio de los medicamentos mediante la figura de la “nación más favorecida”, una fórmula que pretende igualar los precios estadounidenses a los de otros países. El problema es que el Estado federal no compra directamente los fármacos y el sistema está plagado de intermediarios privados, por lo que la medida resulta inaplicable sin una reforma profunda del merc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más de un centenar de mujeres andaluzas reclaman indemnización tras fallos en los cribados de cáncer de mama]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 101 mujeres han presentado reclamaciones patrimoniales ante el Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS) tras desarrollar cáncer de mama debido a fallos en los cribados sanitarios de Andalucía.

La asociación Amama cifra en hasta 338 el número de mujeres afectadas, incluyendo una víctima que ha fallecido. El origen del problema está vinculado a la externalización del servicio y la informatización del sistema, que sustituyó el seguimiento manual y la comunicación directa con las pacientes.

Uno de los datos más alarmantes es la situación de la infancia: uno de cada tres menores vive en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social, y más de dos millones de niños crecen en entornos sin las condiciones mínimas para su desarrollo.

Según relata, la clave está en unas condiciones laborales reguladas y en una remuneración que permite vivir con dignidad del trabajo. En el país nórdico, un camarero puede percibir alrededor de 3.000 euros netos mensuales, a lo que se suman horas extraordinarias pagadas de forma obligatoria y, en muchos casos, la comida incluida durante la jornada laboral.

Sáez destaca que la jornada semanal estándar en Noruega es de 37,5 horas, inferior a las habituales en España, y que existe un respeto real por los descansos y la conciliación entre vida personal y profesional.

Daniel comenzó a vapear en sexto de primaria, en pleno auge de los cigarrillos electrónicos, atraído por su fácil acceso, los sabores dulces y la normalización de su consumo en entornos escolares y sociales. Lo que empezó como algo puntual terminó convirtiéndose en una adicción diaria que llegó a alcanzar un vaper al día, equivalente a unas 700 caladas o a fumar alrededor de 35 cigarrillos.

Con el paso del tiempo, Daniel empezó a notar graves problemas respiratorios: dificultad para respirar al hacer ejercicio, episodios nocturnos de asfixia y una sensación constante de falta de aire, incluso en reposo. Tras acudir al médico, fue diagnosticado con un edema pulmonar incipiente, una afección seria provocada por el vapeo que le llevó a temer por su vida y a replantearse su relación con la salud.

En una entrevista concedida al semanario francés Le Journal du Dimanche, Aznar considera que esta posición transmite una imagen de “sectarismo inútil” y de incomprensión del contexto internacional, especialmente ante los socios de la Alianza Atlántica. Según el exlíder del PP, negarse a cumplir un acuerdo firmado por el resto de países aliados debilita la credibilidad de España y la sitúa en una posición aislada dentro del bloque occidental.

Aznar va más allá del debate presupuestario y califica a Sánchez como un “populista radical”, al que asocia con modelos políticos latinoamericanos como el kirchnerismo. En su diagnóstico, el actual presidente del Gobierno se apoya en alianzas que considera perjudiciales para la estabilidad institucional, mencionando a partidos independentistas, a la izquierda ra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aznar-critica-la-negativa-del-gobierno-de-sanchez-a-elevar-el-gasto-militar-al-5-del-pib</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aznar-critica-la-negativa-del-gobierno-de-sanchez-a-elevar-el-gasto-militar-al-5-del-pib</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Confirmado el colapso del vórtice polar: posibles olas de frío en latitudes medias]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los principales centros meteorológicos mundiales han confirmado un evento de Calentamiento Estratosférico Súbito (CES) que provoca el colapso del vórtice polar estratosférico en el hemisferio norte. Este fenómeno implica un aumento abrupto de las temperaturas en la estratosfera, alterando los patrones climáticos habituales en Europa, Norteamérica y Asia. El vórtice polar actúa normalmente como una barrera que mantiene el aire frío en el Ártico, y su colapso puede debilitar el Jet Stream, permitiendo que el aire polar se desplace hacia el sur y el aire cálido ascienda hacia el norte. Existen dos formas de colapso: desplazamiento, que provoca frío localizado, y división, que puede generar olas de frío generalizadas, como ocurrió en 2018 con la conocida “Bestia del Este”. Tras un CES, los efectos en la superficie no son inmediatos, apareciendo entre dos y cuatro semanas después.

A partir del caso del cómico Quequé y la cancelación de la gira del espectáculo 'Hora Treintaypico', el texto expone cómo sectores de extrema derecha utilizan la violencia verbal y las amenazas físicas para intentar silenciar a comunicadores críticos o vinculados a la izquierda.

El autor subraya que ya no se trata de debates sobre el mal gusto, la sensibilidad o la crítica legítima a un chiste o a un discurso, sino de una estrategia deliberada de intimidación. Amenazas como llamamientos al asesinato o a agresiones directas cruzan una línea peligrosa que afecta a la libertad de expresión y a la seguridad personal. Este tipo de violencia no puede justificarse bajo el argumento de la ofensa, ya que el humor, por definición, es contextual, mutable y sujeto a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-de-las-amenazas-para-silenciar-la-expresion-publica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-de-las-amenazas-para-silenciar-la-expresion-publica</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 13:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Red Política de Valores reúne en Bruselas a dirigentes y organizaciones de la ultraderecha internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La ultraderecha internacional prepara una nueva demostración de fuerza política e ideológica en el corazón de las instituciones europeas.

En los tres años de legislatura, Feijóo ha interrogado en 39 ocasiones al presidente Pedro Sánchez sin dedicar ni una sola pregunta de forma central al estado del sistema ferroviario en España.

Según el estudio realizado por Público, las referencias a los trenes han sido escasas y siempre secundarias. En total, solo aparecen cuatro menciones tangenciales al ferrocarril, realizadas en 2025, y siempre integradas dentro de críticas más amplias sobre impuestos, gestión económica o funcionamiento general del Estado. En ningún caso el transporte ferroviario fue el eje principal de sus intervenciones.

Este dato contrasta con la dureza del discurso del líder del PP tras los recientes accidentes ferroviarios, en los que han fallecido varias personas.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la tarde del 31 de enero en el parque de Josep Serra Martí, una zona frecuentada por vecinos y jóvenes del barrio.

Según la información confirmada por fuentes cercanas a la investigación, los agresores se aproximaron a las víctimas con la intención de sustraerles los patinetes eléctricos que utilizaban. Durante el asalto, emplearon machetes para intimidar y agredir a los menores, provocándoles heridas de consideración. Ambos jóvenes tuvieron que ser trasladados a un centro hospitalario para recibir atención médica urgente. Uno de ellos ya ha recibido el alta hospitalaria, aunque necesitó hasta 15 grapas en la espalda a consecuencia de las lesiones sufridas.

Sin embargo, la planificación del transporte público, especialmente del Metro, está generando una clara desigualdad entre los nuevos barrios del norte y los del sur y sureste de la capital. Mientras desarrollos como Valdebebas o Madrid Nuevo Norte acumulan entre tres y cinco estaciones proyectadas, otros barrios recientes como El Cañaveral siguen sin una estación propia y dependen de conexiones más lejanas o de autobuses.

Valdebebas, con unos 30.000 habitantes y grandes equipamientos como la Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid o el hospital Zendal, contará con varias paradas y una conexión directa con el aeropuerto.

El informe, firmado por el jefe de Servicio de Gestión Presupuestaria, subraya que el volumen de gasto comprometido obligará a adoptar medidas de priorización del gasto público en futuros ejercicios.

Esta medida ha generado un fuerte rechazo entre agricultores y pescadores españoles, que denuncian una situación de competencia desleal.

A partir de una anécdota histórica del rey godo Teodorico, que castigó la falta de principios de un ministro incapaz de ser fiel ni a su dios, la autora traza un paralelismo con reinas y consortes contemporáneas que renunciaron a sus creencias por conveniencia política y matrimonial.

Concostrina analiza varios casos: desde Charlene de Mónaco y su conversión al catolicismo, pasando por Mary de Dinamarca y otras consortes que cambiaron de confesión como trámite administrativo, hasta el ejemplo español, donde la religión fue durante décadas un requisito político de primer orden.

Aunque en los medios se presentan como casos aislados —por ejemplo, empleados despedidos por comerse un producto destinado a la basura—, el texto sostiene que estas situaciones son solo la excusa final de una estrategia planificada.

Según el artículo, las empresas esperan a que el trabajador cometa una falta menor o fabrican acusaciones de bajo rendimiento para justificar un despido disciplinario inmediato, sin preaviso ni indemnización. Si el trabajador no demanda, la empresa consigue un despido gratuito.

Según Pappé, el Estado israelí no puede considerarse una democracia, ya que mantiene un sistema de apartheid que niega derechos civiles y humanos a la población palestina desde 1948 y, especialmente, desde la ocupación iniciada en 1967. Para el historiador, la imagen democrática de Israel es una construcción ideológica que no resiste un análisis riguroso.

Pappé describe una profunda fractura interna entre dos proyectos de país: el denominado “Estado de Judea”, representado por la extrema derecha religiosa y nacionalista aliada a Netanyahu, y el “Estado de Israel”, vinculado a sectores laicos y liberales.

Frente a las imágenes habituales de proyectos urbanos —calles impecables, cielos azules eternos, zonas verdes exuberantes y personas permanentemente felices—, Antirender propone una visión mucho más cercana a lo que suele ocurrir cuando esas obras se materializan en el mundo real.

El funcionamiento es sencillo: el usuario sube un render arquitectónico y, tras una espera de entre 30 y 60 segundos, la IA genera una versión alternativa que introduce los elementos normalmente ausentes en las presentaciones comerciales.

Este sistema de venta directa, oficializado por Jaume I en 1238, permite a los pequeños agricultores ofrecer frutas y verduras frescas y de temporada. Según el concejal de Comercio y Mercados, Santiago Ballester, la ordenanza busca cumplir diez objetivos, entre ellos la reubicación de la 'tira de comptar' del mercado del Cabanyal para evitar competencia desleal con los puestos permanentes del mercado. La oposición, especialmente Compromís, ha criticado duramente la medida, considerándola un ataque a la identidad valenciana y a las tradiciones agrícolas locales. Por su parte, la Unió Llauradora i Ramadera señala que esta decisión puede afectar la venta de proximidad y la sostenibilidad del modelo agroecológico en l'Horta.

A través de ejemplos concretos como Mammee Bay o Roaring River, el reportaje muestra cómo terrenos costeros han sido vendidos a promotores privados, en muchos casos extranjeros, para la construcción de resorts y complejos residenciales de lujo. Estas operaciones han levantado muros físicos y legales que impiden a pescadores y familias locales acceder al mar, afectando directamente a sus medios de vida y a su relación cultural con el entorno natural.

El texto subraya que solo el 0,6 % de los más de mil kilómetros de costa de Jamaica es de acceso público, una cifra especialmente llamativa en un país cuya economía depende en gran medida del turismo de sol y playa.

La candidata favorita, Laura Fernández, representante del oficialismo, lidera las encuestas con opciones reales de ganar en primera vuelta y obtener además mayoría parlamentaria. Su proyecto político se inspira abiertamente en el modelo de seguridad impulsado por el presidente salvadoreño Nayib Bukele, basado en la concentración de poder, el endurecimiento penal y el uso recurrente de estados de excepción.

El auge de este discurso se explica en gran medida por el incremento de la violencia vinculada al crimen organizado. Costa Rica se ha convertido en un país de tránsito clave para el narcotráfico y ha visto emerger organizaciones criminales de alcance internacional, lo que ha disparado los homicidios y la sensación de inseguridad.

Según ha revelado el medio de investigación ProPública, los agentes son Jesús Ochoa, miembro de la Patrulla Fronteriza, y Raymundo Gutiérrez, de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP), ambos destinados habitualmente en el sur de Texas. El caso ha generado una fuerte ola de indignación social y ha intensificado las protestas en diversas ciudades del país.

Pretti es la segunda persona que muere en Mineápolis en enero a manos de agentes federales, tras el fallecimiento de Renee Good el 7 de enero, lo que ha elevado la presión política y social sobre el Gobierno federal.

Tras los accidentes mortales en Adamuz (Córdoba) y Gelida (Barcelona) en enero de 2026, la capacidad de vigilancia de la red ha vuelto a estar en el centro del debate. La principal hipótesis sobre el accidente de Adamuz apunta a la rotura de una soldadura en el carril, lo que subraya la necesidad de revisiones periódicas y efectivas. Según el Ministerio de Transportes, España cuenta con nueve trenes auscultadores en servicio, tres de Renfe y seis de Adif, además de otros vehículos de empresas privadas. Sin embargo, el Sindicato Ferroviario considera que la flota actual es insuficiente, señalando que algunas líneas, como el núcleo de cercanías de Sevilla, llevan más de dos años sin auscultación.

Su enfoque atrevido y provocador la convirtió en un referente mediático y un símbolo de la libertad de prensa recién instaurada en España. La publicación destacó por entrevistar a figuras políticas y culturales, como Adolfo Suárez, y por cubrir escándalos y crímenes que marcaron época, incluyendo el asesinato de los marqueses de Urquijo y la documentación del linchamiento de dos cabos británicos por el IRA. Además, Interviú innovó en la representación de la mujer en los medios, publicando fotografías semidesnudas de celebridades que generaron debate sobre la sexualidad y los roles de género.

En una entrevista concedida en Andorra, país en el que reside actualmente, Mur admite que “muy probablemente” hubo negligencias en la gestión de la crisis sanitaria y vincula la falta de atención directa en las residencias a la escasez de profesionales disponibles en aquel momento.

Según sus explicaciones, durante los días más críticos de marzo de 2020 la atención primaria madrileña sufrió miles de bajas por contagios de covid-19, a lo que se sumó el cierre de 37 servicios de urgencias de atención primaria (SUAP).

Aunque el dólar sigue siendo moneda de reserva, la creciente desconfianza en la sostenibilidad de la deuda estadounidense impulsa a bancos centrales y gobiernos a reforzar sus reservas en metales preciosos. Este fenómeno recuerda la decadencia de antiguas potencias, como Francia y Reino Unido tras el fiasco del Canal de Suez en 1956, y se refleja en la política exterior agresiva de Washington en múltiples frentes, desde Venezuela hasta Cuba. La globalización ha dado lugar a nuevas potencias económicas y tecnológicas, especialmente en Asia, mientras que los intentos de EEUU de mantener su dominio comercial y militar muestran signos de micromilitarismo internacional y de defensiva ante la pérdida de influencia.

En su mensaje, la usuaria insinuaba que, mientras AEMET aseguraba que no se estaba produciendo una situación meteorológica extrema, las imágenes del Niágara congelado demostraban lo contrario. Sin embargo, la publicación omitía un dato esencial: las cataratas del Niágara no se encuentran en territorio español, sino en la frontera entre Canadá y Estados Unidos, a miles de kilómetros de distancia y bajo condiciones climáticas completamente distintas.

La urbanización, levantada en las décadas de 1960 y 1970 sobre dunas y en una zona de alta erosión natural, ignoró la dinámica litoral y eliminó las barreras naturales que permitían a la playa regenerarse tras los temporales. Durante años, la anchura del arenal ocultó el riesgo, pero la pérdida progresiva de arena ha dejado viviendas, paseos marítimos y chiringuitos directamente expuestos al mar.

Las borrascas de 2026 no han creado el problema, sino que han acelerado un proceso anunciado desde hace décadas.

El reportaje se centra en los llamados “long stayers”, personas que llevan al menos tres años en prisión preventiva, algunos incluso más de una década, pese a que la Constitución de Estados Unidos y la legislación de California garantizan el derecho a un juicio rápido.

A través de casos concretos como los de Vincent Bell, Montrail Brackens y Marquez Harrison, el artículo muestra cómo los retrasos se acumulan por continuas prórrogas, falta de jueces, agendas saturadas, escasez de recursos y una dinámica institucional que normaliza aplazar juicios indefinidamente. Aunque los acusados han invocado repetidamente su derecho a un juicio rápido, los tribunales suelen aceptar las solicitudes de aplazamiento de la fiscalía, incluso cuando los retrasos se prolongan durante años.

La autora reflexiona sobre cómo, para muchas madres en contextos de violencia extrema, la muerte llega a percibirse como una forma de descanso ante la imposibilidad de proteger a sus hijos.

El relato se desplaza después a los hermanos de Abdolah, ya en Madrid, mostrando cómo el trauma no se limita a la pérdida o a la enfermedad, sino que se infiltra en gestos cotidianos. Wissem, inquieto y ansioso, y Youssef, el mayor, cargan con cicatrices visibles e invisibles.

Los sistemas de recomendación crean burbujas de opinión que refuerzan creencias existentes, dificultando la exposición a información diversa. Las investigaciones muestran que empresas como Meta generan miles de millones con anuncios fraudulentos y contenidos engañosos, conscientes de su impacto pero priorizando sus beneficios económicos. Este fenómeno también se extiende a contenidos generados por inteligencia artificial, cuyo etiquetado obligatorio aún no se aplica correctamente, evidenciando decisiones políticas y económicas más que limitaciones técnicas.

Aunque en la mayoría de casos la infección es leve o asintomática, T. gondii es capaz de persistir en el organismo y afectar el cerebro de quienes lo portan. En animales como roedores o lobos, se ha observado que la presencia del parásito modifica comportamientos: por ejemplo, en ratones reduce el miedo a los gatos, facilitando así la transmisión del parásito a su hospedador definitivo. Estudios científicos sugieren que en humanos la infección podría estar relacionada con cambios sutiles en la personalidad, tendencia a comportamientos de riesgo o variaciones en neurotransmisores como la dopamina y hormonas como la testosterona. La comunidad científica todavía debate el impacto real de estos efectos, y se necesitan más investigaciones para entender si estas alteraciones son estadísticamente relevantes o simplemente correlacio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-parasito-toxoplasma-gondii-esta-muy-extendido-y-puede-influir-en-el-comportamiento-humano</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-parasito-toxoplasma-gondii-esta-muy-extendido-y-puede-influir-en-el-comportamiento-humano</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno promete revalorizar las pensiones tras el rechazo del decreto y busca apoyos para un nuevo texto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha reafirmado su compromiso de revalorizar las pensiones conforme al IPC tras el rechazo en el Congreso del decreto ley conocido como ‘escudo social’, que fue tumbado por los votos en contra de PP, Vox y Junts.

El decreto rechazado incluía, además de la revalorización de las pensiones, medidas como la limitación de desahucios para personas en situación de vulnerabilidad, el bono social eléctrico, el aumento del Ingreso Mínimo Vital y ayudas extraordinarias a ayuntamientos afectados por la DANA en Valencia.

En términos absolutos, Cataluña es la comunidad con el mayor presupuesto asignado y la segunda con mayor volumen total de inversión ejecutada, con cerca de 2.852 millones de euros invertidos de los más de 7.500 millones previstos.

El texto explica que esta práctica, conocida como “doxing” en el lenguaje común, es presentada por estos grupos como una forma de rendición de cuentas comunitaria frente a la violencia del Estado, no como un intento de incitar al acoso.

Una vez en el domicilio, fingía salir a buscar una botella de vino y, al abrir la puerta, otros dos hombres encapuchados accedían al interior.

El autor la sitúa dentro de la sección 'Canciones con historia', dedicada a rescatar composiciones clave en la evolución de la canción de autor, subrayando la enorme influencia que Yupanqui ejerció sobre varias generaciones de cantautores, especialmente en las décadas de 1960 y 1970.

La canción es presentada como un referente artístico y ético que marcó a figuras como Carlos Cano, Aute, Silvio Rodríguez o Mikel Laboa. Este último relata cómo descubrió la obra de Yupanqui en 1955 a través de un disco recibido desde Burdeos y cómo «Preguntitas sobre Dios» le impactó por su sensibilidad y su carácter radicalmente crítico en un contexto social dominado por el silencio y el miedo.

Estos satélites, desarrollados por Hughes y basados en plataformas cilíndricas como las HS-308/HS-318, operaban en órbitas elípticas altamente excéntricas tipo Molniya, con apogeo sobre el hemisferio norte, lo que les permitía interceptar señales de radares de alerta temprana soviéticos y comunicaciones por microondas durante largos periodos sobre territorio enemigo.

A diferencia de los satélites COMINT como Canyon (órbita cuasigeoestacionaria) o Rhyolite/Aquacade (geoestacionaria), los Jumpseat combinaban capacidades de interceptación de señales desde una posición más cercana y dinámica.

Las piezas, pertenecientes a la realeza del antiguo reino polaco-lituano, fueron descubiertas tras una inspección endoscópica que permitió localizar una cavidad secreta tras una pared de la cripta. En su interior aparecieron coronas, cetros, anillos y medallones envueltos en un periódico fechado en septiembre de 1939, en los primeros días de la invasión nazi de Polonia.

El origen del ocultamiento se remonta a 1931, cuando una inundación dejó al descubierto varios sarcófagos reales en la catedral.

El hallazgo se apoya en datos obtenidos mediante satélites y sensores de humedad del suelo, que muestran una capacidad extraordinaria de retención de agua y una persistencia notable de acuíferos superficiales en el noroeste peninsular.

Este comportamiento no se explica únicamente por la frecuencia de las lluvias, sino por una combinación de factores físicos y climáticos: la interacción del relieve gallego con las masas de aire atlánticas, la estructura geológica de los suelos y la dinámica atmosférica asociada al Atlántico Norte. Gracias a ello, montes y valles mantienen ciclos biológicos activos incluso en periodos sin precipitaciones, algo cada vez menos común en otras regiones europeas sometidas a estrés hídrico.

El fiscal adjunto Todd Blanche anunció que esta publicación concluye el proceso de revisión para garantizar transparencia, aunque se excluyeron o redactaron materiales sensibles como pornografía infantil, imágenes de abuso, lesiones o muerte para proteger a las víctimas y no perjudicar investigaciones en curso. Los archivos revelan correos y conexiones de Epstein con figuras como el príncipe Andrew (con quien intercambió mensajes en 2010 ofreciendo presentaciones), Donald Trump (mencionado cientos de veces, aunque niega conocimiento de delitos), Elon Musk (emails de 2012 sobre fiestas en la isla) y alusiones no verificadas a Bill Gates.

El experto cubano Jorge Piñón, del Instituto de Energía de la Universidad de Texas, advierte que si en las próximas seis a ocho semanas no llega petróleo o combustibles desde proveedores como Venezuela, México o Rusia, el país podría sufrir apagones generalizados y paralización de sectores clave. La isla necesita aproximadamente 110.000 barriles diarios, de los cuales solo 40.000 provienen de su producción interna, lo que hace que dependa en gran medida de las importaciones. Históricamente, Venezuela fue el principal suministrador, pero su producción se ha desplomado, y otros proveedores como México y Rusia aportan cantidades insuficientes.

Lejos de ser una impresión subjetiva, diversos estudios científicos indican que los gatos domésticos han desarrollado estrategias concretas para influir en el comportamiento humano. No actúan solo por instinto, sino que observan, aprenden y ajustan su conducta según la persona con la que interactúan.

Investigaciones de la Universidad de Cornell muestran que los gatos utilizan distintos tipos de maullidos dependiendo del contexto y del interlocutor humano. A diferencia de lo que ocurre entre ellos, los gatos emplean la vocalización principalmente con las personas, afinando sonidos que generan respuestas concretas como atención o alimento. Los maullidos agudos o intermitentes, similares al llanto de un bebé, activan mecanismos automáticos en el cerebro humano, lo que aumenta su eficacia.

Según el Gobierno israelí, la exigencia de estas listas responde a motivos de seguridad y a la necesidad de evitar que la cobertura humanitaria sea utilizada para actividades hostiles o vinculadas al terrorismo. El ministro Amichai Chikli acusó a MSF de falta de transparencia y de actuar por intereses ajenos a la seguridad. Desde el ministerio aseguran que la información solicitada se usaría únicamente con fines administrativos internos y no sería compartida con terceros.

Rehmet, veterano militar y líder sindical, se presentó como una alternativa centrada en los derechos laborales, el apoyo a los veteranos y la defensa de servicios públicos básicos.

A través de la Nouvelle Droite, estos movimientos han ganado terreno en países como Italia, Estados Unidos y Rusia, utilizando la pobreza, la ansiedad y la rabia popular para ganar apoyo. El análisis aborda cómo estos movimientos están desmantelando progresivamente las democracias y los derechos humanos. Además, Delle Donne explica el rol de los tecnocapitalistas, la influencia de los grandes millonarios y cómo las ideas ultraderechistas han sido absorbidas incluso por sectores políticos que históricamente las rechazaban.

El caso ha puesto el foco en el decreto aprobado por el Consell de Carlos Mazón el 10 de diciembre de 2024, que modificó de forma sustancial las condiciones de acceso a este tipo de viviendas. La nueva normativa elevó el límite de renta de 46.800 a 54.600 euros anuales, con posibilidad de alcanzar hasta los 66.360 euros si se cumplían determinados requisitos, así como el precio máximo del metro cuadrado, que pasó a 2.400 euros.

Gracias a estos cambios, perfiles con ingresos elevados, como una concejala de Urbanismo con un sueldo cercano a los 59.000 euros anuales, pudieron acceder a viviendas protegidas con precios muy por debajo del mercado.

El artista se encontraba ingresado desde hacía un par de días en el Hospital Universitario La Fe, centro en el que ya había sido tratado anteriormente por problemas respiratorios. Su muerte pone fin a la trayectoria de una de las figuras más reconocibles del humor popular español de las décadas de los setenta y ochenta.

Nacido en Zaragoza el 14 de enero de 1945, Fernando Esteso Allué creció en el seno de una familia vinculada a la jota, lo que marcó desde muy temprano su vocación artística. Con apenas seis años debutó sobre los escenarios como “El Niño de la Jota” y, a partir de ahí, se formó en el teatro de variedades y la revista, un entorno que le permitió desarrollar una notable versatilidad como cantante, actor y humorista. Esa base escénica sería clave para su posterior éxito en cine y televisión.

La decisión se produce en un contexto de fuerte tensión social y política por las redadas migratorias impulsadas por el Gobierno federal en el estado de Minesota, que han sido rechazadas por autoridades locales y han provocado movilizaciones masivas en las últimas semanas.

Según explicó el propio Trump a través de la red social Truth, las fuerzas federales no intervendrán en manifestaciones ni disturbios salvo que los gobiernos estatales o municipales soliciten expresamente su ayuda. Con esta orden, el Ejecutivo traslada la responsabilidad principal del mantenimiento del orden público a las autoridades locales y estatales, aunque mantiene el despliegue federal para la protección de edificios e instalaciones del Gobierno central.

Su análisis se apoya en el fuerte aumento del precio del oro y la plata, que interpreta como una señal de desconfianza global hacia el dólar y de un repunte inflacionario más profundo de lo que reflejan las cifras oficiales.

Schiff sostiene que los bancos centrales están incrementando sus reservas de oro y reduciendo su exposición al dólar y a los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, lo que, a su juicio, anticipa una crisis de deuda soberana y un debilitamiento del estatus del dólar como moneda de reserva mundial. En su intervención, afirma que la economía de Estados Unidos depende en exceso del consumo y del crédito, así como de la financiación externa, y que este modelo se vuelve insostenible si el resto del mundo deja de respaldar al dólar.

Este tipo de escritura, conocida también como 'blackletter', se asoció con los movimientos nacionalistas de la derecha, a pesar de su origen medieval y su adopción por diversas culturas de Europa. La lucha entre los estilos de escritura gótica y romana refleja la tensión entre la modernidad y el pasado, y cómo los nazis utilizaron esta caligrafía para promover su ideología de pureza germánica.

Acusado de manipular la información sobre el fraude fiscal de la familia Ayuso, su influencia en los medios y la política es indiscutible. A pesar de los escándalos, sigue en su puesto sin que la oposición logre que rinda cuentas. Rodríguez, con un salario de 100.000 euros, controla una vasta red de relaciones y recursos, incluidos pagos millonarios en publicidad institucional que, según sus críticos, compra la voluntad de los medios. Su figura se mantiene intocable, respaldada por Ayuso, quien le permite actuar con total libertad mientras desplaza a sus enemigos dentro del PP.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miguel-angel-rodriguez-sigue-impune-mientras-concentra-poder-en-la-comunidad-de-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miguel-angel-rodriguez-sigue-impune-mientras-concentra-poder-en-la-comunidad-de-madrid</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El empleo público en España alcanza su nivel más bajo en 16 años, mientras crece el empleo privado]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 2025, el empleo público en España cayó por debajo del 16%, su nivel más bajo en 16 años. Este descenso se debe a la aceleración del empleo privado y la desaceleración del empleo público. Desde 2019, la ocupación en el sector público ha aumentado un 10,1%, frente al 12,8% del sector privado. A pesar de las convocatorias récord para el empleo público, el número de trabajadores en este sector ha disminuido en 2025, debido a que muchas de estas ofertas son de sustitución. A nivel regional, Madrid ha registrado una reducción en el empleo público, mientras que en otras comunidades como Extremadura el empleo público sigue siendo fundamental para la economía local. En general, el mercado laboral español ha mostrado una fuerte recuperación, con un crecimiento sostenido del empleo privado que ya supera al público, lo que contradice la idea de que el empleo público es el motor principal del mercado laboral.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-empleo-publico-en-espana-alcanza-su-nivel-mas-bajo-en-16-anos-mientras-crece-el-empleo-privado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-empleo-publico-en-espana-alcanza-su-nivel-mas-bajo-en-16-anos-mientras-crece-el-empleo-privado</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 09:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un juez federal ordena liberar a un niño de 5 años y a su padre detenidos por ICE en Texas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un juez federal de Estados Unidos ha ordenado la liberación de Liam Conejo Ramos, un niño de 5 años, y de su padre, que permanecían detenidos en un centro residencial familiar del sur de Texas tras ser arrestados por agentes de inmigración. Ambos fueron detenidos en la puerta de su vivienda en un suburbio de Minneapolis y trasladados a más de 2.000 kilómetros de distancia, donde han permanecido retenidos durante más de una semana mientras avanzaba su caso migratorio.

En una resolución especialmente dura, el juez Fred Biery criticó con severidad la actuación del Gobierno estadounidense, al que acusó de aplicar de forma incompetente políticas migratorias basadas en cuotas de deportación, incluso cuando ello implica causar daño psicológico a menores. El magistrado recurrió a referencias históricas como la Declaración de Independencia y las advertencias de los padres fundadores para denunciar lo que considera un comportamiento autoritario y contrario al Estado de derecho.

En una comparecencia oficial, la portavoz del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Rusia, María Zajárova, afirmó que Moscú considera insuficiente y poco creíble cualquier investigación que limite las responsabilidades a un solo actor y reclamó un proceso exhaustivo, imparcial y verdaderamente transparente.

Zajárova subrayó que, a juicio de Rusia, el ataque contra una infraestructura energética estratégica de esta magnitud solo pudo llevarse a cabo con capacidades técnicas, logísticas y de inteligencia que van más allá de un grupo reducido o de un único país. En este sentido, reiteró que Moscú no descarta la implicación de otros Estados o actores internacionales y exigió que todas las hipótesis sean analizadas sin exclusiones políticas previas.

Huerta Chuma, que ha vivido en EE. UU. durante más de 20 años, fue perseguido por ICE, quienes lo acusaban de ser un criminal. Según Huerta Chuma, la confrontación fue rápida, sin que Pretti intentara agredir a los agentes, quienes le dispararon sin provocación. A pesar de la versión inicial del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), que insinuó que Pretti intentó atacar a los agentes, un informe preliminar contradice esa afirmación. Huerta Chuma ha quedado devastado por la muerte de Pretti, pues no pudo intervenir y se siente culpable por no haber evitado la tragedia.

La inflamación provocada por la periodontitis podría ser un factor clave, ya que las bacterias de la boca pueden entrar en el torrente sanguíneo y favorecer la acumulación de grasa en las arterias, lo que incrementa las probabilidades de sufrir infartos o ictus. Además, la microbiota intestinal también juega un papel importante en esta relación, ya que ciertos metabolitos presentes en el intestino pueden influir en el sistema cardiovascular. La prevención, como mantener una correcta higiene bucal y una dieta saludable, es fundamental para reducir los riesgos de enfermedades tanto dentales como cardiovasculares.

Esto ha generado controversia por posibles violaciones de derechos y perfil racial. Se menciona un vídeo viral de Ramón Menera, ciudadano estadounidense detenido por su acento. Analistas como Yamila Pino y Roger Senserrich destacan 'grises legales' en las políticas de Trump, incluyendo entradas en domicilios con órdenes administrativas (cuestionadas por violar la Cuarta Enmienda), reducción de formación de agentes, duplicación de efectivos hasta 22.000 y reclutamiento masivo.

Por un lado, el país mantiene una legislación de inmigración extremadamente restrictiva que dificulta la regularización de los inmigrantes pobres; por otro, su economía depende de forma esencial de esa misma mano de obra barata para sostener sectores clave como la agricultura, los servicios domésticos o el mantenimiento básico. La solución racional —facilitar la regularización— es descartada deliberadamente, optándose en su lugar por una tolerancia informal que permite disponer de trabajadores en situación de vulnerabilidad permanente, altamente rentables para los empleadores.

El texto analiza cómo esta hipocresía se traduce en una tensión social y política: los inmigrantes son percibidos como necesarios pero indeseables, útiles pero molestos.

En una entrevista reciente, el artista destacó que la hostilidad percibida hacia China es más un reflejo de la incapacidad de Occidente para competir con el país asiático que una amenaza real de hostilidad. Ai argumenta que, históricamente, fue el Imperio Británico el que invadió China, pero hoy en día, China ha logrado posicionarse como una potencia global mediante el trabajo arduo de su población, mientras que Occidente, más relajado en su enfoque laboral, ha comenzado a perder terreno. Además, señaló que, a pesar de que Occidente se beneficia de productos como el iPhone, la balanza económica favorece a China, que ha experimentado un rápido crecimiento en las últimas décadas.

El proyecto, desarrollado por una cooperativa privada tras la subasta del suelo municipal entre 2018 y 2022, ha situado en el centro del debate a familiares de cargos públicos, funcionarios municipales y profesionales vinculados al sector inmobiliario que resultaron compradores de estas viviendas.

La polémica se intensificó tras conocerse que la entonces concejala de Urbanismo, familiares directos de la jefa del área municipal de Contratación y un arquitecto municipal figuraban entre los socios cooperativistas. La situación derivó en la dimisión de la edil de Urbanismo y de una alta responsable municipal, así como en peticiones de explicaciones por parte de PSOE, Compromís y Sumar, este último con una denuncia ante la Fiscalía Anticorrupción.

La GKS subraya que esta lucha no solo se enfrenta al fascismo, sino también a la defensa de los derechos de la clase trabajadora, la militarización y los recortes de libertades.

Los jugadores tienen que usar una variedad de habilidades limitadas, como cavar, construir escaleras o hacer que los lemmings usen paracaídas. El reto es gestionar bien estas habilidades para superar los niveles, ya que cada vez se presentan desafíos más difíciles. A medida que avanzan los niveles, los obstáculos aumentan, poniendo a prueba la estrategia y la creatividad del jugador. El control se realiza únicamente con el ratón, y cada fase superada permite al jugador obtener un código para continuar desde allí.

En la entrevista, Portero explica que este libro fue escrito en un momento vital extremadamente oscuro, durante su proceso de transición, cuando no esperaba sobrevivir a lo que estaba escribiendo.

El texto subraya la dimensión vengativa de su gobierno, tanto contra antiguos adversarios políticos como mediante el indulto o la recompensa a aliados implicados en prácticas delictivas.

En política interior, Bassets describe un endurecimiento extremo: militarización de la gestión migratoria, discurso xenófobo y racista, y una ofensiva cultural contra lo que el trumpismo denomina políticas “woke”.

Más allá del impacto visual de las fotografías, los archivos incluyen correos electrónicos que comprometen aún más la figura del duque de York.

Aunque estas acciones se realizaron antes de que se conocieran públicamente los escándalos de Epstein, la noticia ha generado un debate intenso en redes sociales, especialmente en X, sobre la cobertura mediática desigual según la ideología política. Muchos usuarios critican que la aparición de Aznar ha recibido poca atención mediática en comparación con lo que ocurriría si se tratase de figuras políticas de izquierdas, como Pedro Sánchez o Pablo Iglesias.

Algunos miembros de la comunidad islámica local solicitaron que se retirara el objeto, considerándolo de mal gusto y potencialmente ofensivo para los musulmanes. Sin embargo, no existe ninguna norma legal que prohíba su exposición, y el Ayuntamiento no ha emitido ningún requerimiento oficial. La iniciativa ha dividido opiniones: mientras algunos defienden la libertad comercial y la tradición cultural italiana, otros consideran que los espacios públicos deberían evitar símbolos que puedan herir sensibilidades religiosas. Incluso algunos empleados musulmanes del local han mostrado su apoyo a mantener la figura, argumentando que forma parte de la identidad del comercio y no resulta ofensiva. El caso refleja la tensión entre respeto a distintas sensibilidades culturales y la protección de libertades individuales y com]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-padua-por-un-muneco-de-cerdo-en-la-vitrina-de-un-comercio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-padua-por-un-muneco-de-cerdo-en-la-vitrina-de-un-comercio</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ocho meses de prisión y prohibición de tener animales por un grave caso de maltrato en Riós]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un juzgado de lo Penal de Ourense ha condenado a José P. F., de 77 años, por un grave delito de maltrato animal cometido en su domicilio de Castrelo de Abaixo, en el municipio ourensano de Riós. El acusado reconoció los hechos y aceptó una pena de ocho meses de prisión, además de dos años de inhabilitación para la tenencia de animales, evitando así la celebración del juicio oral. La pena de cárcel queda suspendida durante dos años con la condición de que no vuelva a delinquir.

La investigación, llevada a cabo por la Guardia Civil, describió una conducta reiterada y extremadamente cruel hacia los animales con los que convivía. Según los informes policiales y la acusación, el hombre golpeaba, pateaba y agredía de forma habitual e injustificada a gatos, un perro y gallinas. Entre los hechos probados figura que llegó a sacar un ojo a un gato tras golpearlo violentamente, que rociaba al perro con insecticida directamente en los ojos y que utilizaba un palo con una punta para pincharle el h]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ocho-meses-de-prision-y-prohibicion-de-tener-animales-por-un-grave-caso-de-maltrato-en-rios</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ocho-meses-de-prision-y-prohibicion-de-tener-animales-por-un-grave-caso-de-maltrato-en-rios</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crisis humanitaria en Gaza: decenas de bebés mueren por frío y condiciones insalubres en refugios temporales]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Gaza, la situación humanitaria continúa deteriorándose tras la ofensiva israelí de octubre de 2023. Las restricciones en el acceso a refugios adecuados y medicamentos han dejado a cientos de miles de personas desplazadas viviendo en tiendas de campaña y estructuras temporales, expuestas a frío extremo, humedad y falta de higiene básica. Este invierno, al menos diez bebés menores de un año han muerto por hipotermia, elevando a más de dos docenas las víctimas infantiles desde el inicio del conflicto. Los expertos médicos han acuñado el término “síndrome de la tienda mojada” para describir las enfermedades y complicaciones derivadas de estas condiciones extremas, que afectan principalmente a niños, ancianos, embarazadas y enfermos crónicos. La falta de acceso a medicación esencial, como inhaladores y analgésicos, agrava la crisis sanitaria, mientras que los hospitales locales luchan por atender complicaciones respiratorias y brotes de gripe.

El autismo es una condición del neurodesarrollo de origen neurobiológico y genético que acompaña a la persona durante toda su vida, y no existe evidencia que indique que pueda ser causado o revertido mediante vacunas o tratamientos alternativos. Estas teorías pseudocientíficas se originan en un estudio fraudulento de 1998 de Andrew Wakefield, ya retirado y desacreditado, que provocó décadas de desinformación con consecuencias negativas.

Según el escritor español Santiago Posteguillo, la fascinación por César reside en que poseía cualidades ausentes en los políticos actuales, especialmente la capacidad de cumplir sus promesas. Su última obra, 'Los tres mundos', cierra la trilogía dedicada a su vida, abordando sus campañas militares en la Galia, Britania y Germania, y su influencia política en Roma junto a Pompeyo y Craso. Posteguillo destaca la complejidad del personaje: si bien se le conoce como dictador, era generoso con sus enemigos y tenía una vida privada significativa, marcada por pérdidas personales. Además, César combinaba el arte de la guerra con la oratoria y la cultura, algo poco frecuente en líderes contemporáneos. El autor subraya que César entendía la importancia de comunicar y controlar el relato, anticipándose a conceptos similares al periodismo moderno.

La iniciativa responde a una demanda histórica de los vecinos del sur de la región, que reclaman una mejora sustancial en las conexiones de transporte público entre ambos municipios y con el resto del área metropolitana madrileña.

Actualmente, la línea 10 finaliza su recorrido en la estación de Puerta del Sur, situada en Alcorcón. El proyecto planteado propone prolongar el trazado desde ese punto con el objetivo de integrar nuevos barrios en la red ferroviaria. En concreto, la moción contempla la creación de una nueva estación en el Ensanche Sur de Alcorcón y otra parada en el barrio de Villafontana, ya en Móstoles, antes de enlazar con la estación existente de Manuela Malasaña.

El detonante más reciente llega desde Francia, donde algunos trenes de alta velocidad han habilitado vagones sin niños menores de 12 años, una medida que recuerda al coche en silencio del AVE español, donde no se permite viajar a menores de 14 años ni a mascotas.

A través de ejemplos concretos, el reportaje analiza hasta qué punto estas decisiones responden a una discriminación hacia los niños o, por el contrario, a una falta de control y educación por parte de algunos padres. Restauradores, hoteleros y responsables de negocios turísticos explican que, en muchos casos, no se trata de rechazar a los menores, sino de garantizar una convivencia mínima en espacios que no están pensados para el ruido, el juego o la supervisión constante.

La vivienda pertenece a la Venerable Orden Tercera de San Francisco de Asís (VOT), una entidad religiosa con un amplio patrimonio inmobiliario que, según denuncian las activistas, ha actuado durante años como un gran tenedor más.

La práctica religiosa también ha disminuido de forma notable, especialmente tras la pandemia de COVID-19, y solo el 18,7 % de los encuestados se considera creyente practicante, mientras que la mayoría de los creyentes se declaran no practicantes.

Los inmigrantes de países como Marruecos, Colombia y Argelia presentan tasas de cotización muy bajas, con algunos casos cercanos al 30%.

El origen del problema se sitúa en 1921, cuando el ingeniero Thomas Midgley, trabajando para General Motors, descubrió que añadir tetraetilo de plomo a la gasolina evitaba el llamado ‘golpeo del motor’, un fallo común en los primeros motores de combustión. Este hallazgo permitió mejorar el rendimiento de los vehículos y aceleró la expansión del automóvil, pero tuvo un coste humano y ambiental gigantesco.

A pesar de que la toxicidad del plomo era conocida desde la Antigüedad, las empresas implicadas —General Motors, Exxon y DuPont— impulsaron su uso mediante campañas de marketing que ocultaban el riesgo, rebautizando el aditivo como “Etil”. Incluso el propio Midgley llegó a inhalar el gas en público para tranquilizar a la opinión pública.

El asentamiento, perteneciente al pueblo íbero de los sedetanos y destruido violentamente durante las guerras sertorianas (76-72 a.C.), ofrece una imagen excepcional de cómo la escritura formaba parte de la vida cotidiana y no era un recurso exclusivo de las élites.

Las inscripciones aparecen mayoritariamente sobre cerámica: platos, cuencos, tapaderas, pesas y ánforas. En la vajilla de barniz negro importada de Italia, considerada un bien de prestigio, predominan grafitos breves y discretos, a menudo una sola letra, probablemente usados para identificar la propiedad sin dañar la estética del objeto.

Los bombardeos se produjeron en varias partes de la Franja, como el norte y el sur, y uno de los ataques involucró un dron que mató a un padre y sus hijos en Jan Yunis. En el norte de Gaza, otro bombardeo acabó con la vida de una madre y tres de sus hijos. Estos ataques se dan a pesar de la existencia de un alto el fuego que había entrado en vigor en octubre de 2025, y a pesar de que la violencia parecía haberse calmado temporalmente. Con esta nueva tragedia, la cifra de palestinos muertos desde el alto el fuego supera ya los 500, incluyendo más de cien niños. Estos ataques se suman a más de mil incidentes desde el inicio de la tregua y demuestran la falta de respeto por los acuerdos de alto el fuego por parte de Israel. Además, el conflicto ha causado una situación humanitaria crítica en Gaza, que sufre de una gran escasez de alimentos ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-mata-a-12-palestinos-en-gaza-tras-el-alto-el-fuego-incluida-una-familia-entera</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-mata-a-12-palestinos-en-gaza-tras-el-alto-el-fuego-incluida-una-familia-entera</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europa Laica critica la celebración de un funeral oficial católico tras la tragedia de Adamuz]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tras la tragedia ocurrida en Adamuz, Europa Laica ha mostrado sus condolencias a las familias afectadas pero ha criticado duramente que las autoridades públicas hayan optado por un funeral religioso católico como acto oficial.

Además, señala que un acto oficial de este tipo excluye a ciudadanos de otras creencias o sin ellas, y convierte un momento de duelo colectivo en un evento religioso institucional, lo que consideran un retroceso en la convivencia democrática. Europa Laica insiste en que las ceremonias privadas son legítimas según las creencias de cada familia, pero que los homenajes promovidos por el sector público deben ser exclusivamente laicos, garantizando la neutralidad y pluralidad.

Aunque el presidente ha insinuado que las ‘midterms’ de noviembre serían innecesarias o fraudulentas si los demócratas ganan, no existe ningún precedente ni mecanismo legal que le permita cancelarlas. La Constitución otorga a los estados la principal autoridad electoral y fija fechas concretas tanto para los comicios como para la toma de posesión del nuevo Congreso, lo que reduce de forma drástica el margen de maniobra presidencial.

El texto repasa las hipótesis más extremas, como la declaración de la ley marcial o el uso de la Ley de Insurrección, y concluye que, además de dudosas desde el punto de vista legal, resultarían impracticables a nivel logístico en un país donde votan más de cien millones de personas.

Las principales aseguradoras de salud han iniciado una corrección de márgenes que se traduce en subidas generalizadas de las primas, con incrementos que oscilan entre el 12% y el 20% en las renovaciones anuales. Estas subidas superan ampliamente la inflación general y se justifican, según el sector, por el aumento de la llamada inflación médica, que ya alcanza el 8,4% debido al encarecimiento de tratamientos avanzados, especialmente oncológicos, y a la actualización de tarifas de los grandes grupos hospitalarios.

Sin embargo, el aspecto que más malestar está generando entre los asegurados no es solo el encarecimiento de las pólizas, sino el uso creciente de la cláusula de no renovación por siniestralidad. Muchas compañías están optando por no prorrogar los contratos de clientes que presentan enfermedades crónicas, patologías previas o un elevado uso del seguro, una práctica legal pero controvertida.

A su juicio, el principal error progresista ha sido no combatir con suficiente eficacia el discurso de la extrema derecha que culpa a la inmigración del deterioro de los servicios públicos, cuando —sostiene— los verdaderos responsables son las políticas fiscales y de privatización impulsadas por los gobiernos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Bergerot señala directamente a los grandes patrimonios y a los millonarios que, según afirma, han encontrado en Madrid un auténtico paraíso fiscal gracias a la supresión y rebaja de impuestos autonómicos, lo que ha supuesto dejar de recaudar miles de millones de euros al año.

Según una nueva estadística experimental del Banco de España, el 10% de los hogares con mayor riqueza concentra ya el 42% del valor total de la vivienda residencial, lo que equivale a unos 2,6 billones de euros. En contraste, la mitad más pobre de la población apenas acumula el 12,5% de ese valor, alrededor de 776.000 millones de euros. Esta brecha no es coyuntural, sino el resultado de una tendencia sostenida que se ha intensificado con el paso del tiempo.

Los datos, correspondientes a la primera mitad de 2025, muestran que desde 2011 la concentración de la riqueza inmobiliaria ha aumentado de forma clara. En aquel año, el 10% más rico poseía el 34,3% del valor de las viviendas, mientras que el 50% más pobre alcanzaba el 20,6%.

Según recoge elEconomista a partir de análisis de expertos citados por Bloomberg, las políticas de control migratorio aplicadas por Donald Trump desde el inicio de su segundo mandato estarían reduciendo de forma notable la aportación de la inmigración al crecimiento poblacional. Las últimas proyecciones oficiales del censo, publicadas en 2023, situaban la primera caída de población en torno a 2081, pero algunos analistas consideran que ese escenario podría adelantarse de manera significativa, incluso a 2026 en el escenario más extremo.

El factor clave es que la inmigración neta ha sido durante décadas el principal motor del crecimiento demográfico de EEUU, compensando la baja natalidad y el envejecimiento de la población nativa. Si esa inmigración deja de equilibrar más muertes y menos nacimientos, el país podría entrar en una fase de estancamiento o retroceso poblacional simila]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-politicas-migratorias-de-trump-podrian-acelerar-el-estancamiento-o-la-caida-demografica-en-eeuu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-politicas-migratorias-de-trump-podrian-acelerar-el-estancamiento-o-la-caida-demografica-en-eeuu</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cantabria inicia la privatización de servicios sanitarios a Hospital Santa Clotilde antes de completar sus dotaciones]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Hospital Santa Clotilde de Santander, gestionado por la Orden Hospitalaria de San Juan de Dios, se ha convertido en el centro de la polémica tras la firma de un convenio con el Servicio Cántabro de Salud por el que recibirá 256 millones de euros durante los próximos 16 años para prestar servicios sanitarios.

Este desplome se produjo tras la publicación de sus resultados trimestrales, que mostraron un gasto récord de 37.500 millones de dólares en inteligencia artificial, mientras que su unidad de computación en la nube, Azure, experimentó una desaceleración en su crecimiento. La noticia generó preocupación entre los inversores sobre la rentabilidad de las inversiones masivas en IA realizadas por las grandes tecnológicas. Este movimiento bursátil ha tenido un efecto contagio en otras compañías, con pérdidas significativas para Alphabet y Nvidia, aunque Alphabet logró recuperarse parcialmente al cerrar con un ligero aumento.

El accidente se produjo en plena temporada de lluvias, cuando la inestabilidad del terreno aumenta y los deslizamientos de tierra son más probables. De acuerdo con un portavoz del gobernador designado por los rebeldes en la zona, entre las víctimas hay mineros artesanales, así como mujeres y niños que se encontraban en el lugar. Algunas personas pudieron ser rescatadas con vida, aunque varias sufrieron heridas graves y al menos una veintena estaba siendo atendida en centros sanitarios cercanos.

Rubaya es un enclave minero de gran relevancia, ya que produce alrededor del 15% del coltán mundial.

Las Médulas, declaradas Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO, combinan un enorme valor histórico, arqueológico y paisajístico, por lo que la magnitud del incendio generó una fuerte preocupación social e institucional.

Según el estudio, el fuego afectó principalmente a la vegetación superficial y a determinadas zonas del suelo, pero no produjo una degradación estructural profunda que impida la regeneración natural. Los investigadores señalan que especies vegetales autóctonas de la zona están adaptadas a episodios de incendios y pueden rebrotar con relativa rapidez si se dan las condiciones adecuadas de protección y manejo del terreno.

Fanon decidió transformar su intervención en la lectura de un manifiesto crítico y abandonar el escenario sin aceptar preguntas, gesto que fue recibido con aplausos por parte del público.

En su texto y en posteriores declaraciones a EL PAÍS, Fanon sostiene que Machado representa una expresión contemporánea del fascismo, al que vincula con el colonialismo, la supremacía blanca y la extrema derecha internacional.

Esta interpretación se recoge en la consulta vinculante V1261-25, de 9 de julio de 2025, que analiza el caso de un matrimonio de más de 65 años que desea donar el pleno dominio de su vivienda habitual a sus descendientes.

Con carácter general, la donación de un inmueble supone una alteración del patrimonio del donante y puede generar una ganancia o pérdida patrimonial que, normalmente, debe declararse en el IRPF. Sin embargo, la normativa fiscal contempla una exención específica para las transmisiones de la vivienda habitual realizadas por contribuyentes mayores de 65 años.

Sin embargo, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) mantiene que el invierno 2025-2026 tiene altas probabilidades de ser más cálido de lo normal y, hasta la fecha, no ha registrado ninguna ola de frío oficial. Esta aparente contradicción se explica por la diferencia entre la percepción cotidiana del tiempo y los criterios climatológicos con los que se elaboran los pronósticos estacionales.

La previsión de AEMET no afirmaba que no fuera a hacer frío en ningún momento, sino que asignaba entre un 60 % y un 70 % de probabilidad a que la temperatura media del trimestre (diciembre, enero y febrero) estuviera por encima de la media histórica. Estos pronósticos son probabilísticos y se refieren al conjunto del periodo, no a episodios concretos de pocos días.

Durante años, la investigación se centró en cómo el cerebro influía en el aparato digestivo, sobre todo en situaciones de estrés. Sin embargo, la neurociencia actual está demostrando que el flujo de información también va en sentido contrario: lo que ocurre en el intestino condiciona de forma directa la actividad cerebral y, en última instancia, nuestra conducta y bienestar emocional.

Castellanos destaca el papel del eje intestino-cerebro y de una región cerebral clave, la ínsula, donde se integran las señales internas del cuerpo. En esta zona se representa no solo el estado físico interno, sino también aspectos ligados a la identidad personal. Desde esta perspectiva, el 'yo' no se entiende sin el cuerpo, lo que rompe con la tradicional separación entre mente y organismo.

Esta idea, defendida por algunos físicos y filósofos de la ciencia, surge al intentar reconciliar dos de los grandes pilares de la física moderna: la relatividad general, que describe el comportamiento del espacio-tiempo a gran escala, y la mecánica cuántica, que rige el mundo subatómico.

En ciertos modelos teóricos, especialmente en propuestas de gravedad cuántica, el tiempo deja de aparecer como una variable básica. En su lugar, el universo se describe mediante relaciones entre estados físicos, sin una evolución temporal clara.

Según la información difundida por la agencia EFE y recogida por Infobae, los archivos incluyen un pago de 1.050 dólares registrado el 17 de octubre de 2003 a nombre de José María Aznar. El abono fue realizado por Epstein a Shoppers Travel Inc., una agencia que el financiero utilizaba de forma habitual para gestionar vuelos y desplazamientos de personas de su entorno profesional.

La documentación desclasificada también hace referencia a dos envíos postales realizados entre 2003 y 2004 por Epstein y su entonces pareja, Ghislaine Maxwell, dirigidos al matrimonio Aznar. El primero fue enviado en septiembre de 2003 desde las oficinas de Epstein en Nueva York y entregado mediante FedEx en el Palacio de la Moncloa, cuando Aznar ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentos-desclasificados-de-epstein-recogen-un-pago-y-envios-postales-relacionados-con-jose-maria-aznar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentos-desclasificados-de-epstein-recogen-un-pago-y-envios-postales-relacionados-con-jose-maria-aznar</guid><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desarticulado un grupo criminal itinerante acusado de varios hurtos en bancos de Málaga y otras ciudades]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha desarticulado un grupo criminal itinerante formado por dos células que presuntamente cometían hurtos en entidades bancarias de distintas provincias españolas, entre ellas Málaga. La operación se ha saldado con la detención de cuatro personas en Madrid, ciudad donde el grupo tenía su centro logístico y desde la que planificaban los desplazamientos y repartían funciones antes de actuar en otras comunidades autónomas.

La investigación comenzó en enero tras dos hurtos cometidos en oficinas bancarias de Sevilla y Málaga, en los que los sospechosos lograron hacerse con más de 100.000 euros. En uno de los casos sustrajeron directamente el cajetín registrador y en otro aprovecharon una maniobra de distracción: un empleado salió de la sucursal para ayudar a una persona que fingía tener la tarjeta atascada, momento en el que robaron una elevada cantidad de dinero que había quedado sobre la mesa.

Uno de los episodios más extraordinarios de su historia tuvo lugar en noviembre de 1971, cuando Alvechurch y Oxford City, dos equipos semiprofesionales, disputaron la eliminatoria más larga jamás vista en el torneo. El enfrentamiento necesitó seis partidos de desempate y un total de 660 minutos de juego para resolverse.

La serie comenzó con un empate 2-2 en el campo del Alvechurch y continuó con sucesivos empates en distintos estadios de las Midlands, incluyendo White House Ground, Manor Ground, St. Andrew’s y finalmente Villa Park. Los jugadores compaginaban el fútbol con sus trabajos diarios en fábricas, escuelas o en la construcción, lo que añadía un componente de sacrificio y desgaste físico.

El Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica plantea esta medida apoyándose en informes científicos y en recomendaciones internacionales que alertan del desplome de la población de anguila, estimado en hasta un 98% en los últimos 50 años. La propuesta deberá contar con el respaldo de todas las comunidades autónomas, ya que la pesca de angula se regula a nivel regional, y será debatida en una reunión prevista para el 17 de febrero.

Aunque el pacto tiene un claro impacto comercial —reducción de aranceles, apertura de mercados y normas concretas y exigibles—, su verdadero significado reside en el contexto político internacional: refleja una creciente voluntad de las grandes economías de reducir su dependencia de Estados Unidos.

Krugman sostiene que este giro es consecuencia directa de la política comercial y exterior errática de la Administración Trump, basada en una visión de suma cero del comercio internacional y en el uso de los aranceles como herramienta de presión. Frente a ello, la UE e India entienden el libre comercio como una relación mutuamente beneficiosa entre dos economías de enorme tamaño y carácter complementario.

Su muerte se produjo mientras permanecía ingresado a la espera de una intervención quirúrgica, tras varias semanas en las que su estado de salud había sido delicado. La noticia ha causado un notable impacto en la escena musical andaluza y especialmente en el entorno del flamenco-rock, donde su aportación fue muy valorada.

Davile está considerado una de las piezas importantes en el desarrollo de la llamada cultura garrapatera, un estilo nacido en Jerez de la Frontera que mezcla flamenco, rumba, rock y una lírica de inspiración callejera. Durante los años noventa formó parte del proyecto Palocortao junto a Diego Pozo, etapa que sería decisiva en su trayectoria musical. Posteriormente mantuvo una estrecha relación creativa con el grupo Los Delinqüentes, para quienes trabajó como letrista y colaborador.

La intervención policial se inició cuando una patrulla observó a un joven circulando por la acera con un patinete eléctrico que carecía del sistema de alumbrado obligatorio. Al darle el alto para proceder a su identificación, los agentes localizaron un cuchillo oculto en la manga de la prenda que vestía el individuo, por lo que el arma fue intervenida de inmediato por motivos de seguridad.

Aunque el acuerdo establecía explícitamente que el asesoramiento sería gratuito y sin contraprestación económica, la Comisión Investigadora del Congreso detectó movimientos financieros sospechosos ocurridos el mismo día de la firma. Dos billeteras digitales atribuidas a Davis transfirieron un total de 1.014.000 dólares en USDC a un intermediario jubilado, quien derivó esos fondos a una presunta “cueva cripto” en menos de tres horas.

Redgrave, ya entonces una actriz consagrada, había defendido públicamente la causa palestina y mantenido contactos con la OLP, lo que provocó protestas y tensiones previas a la gala, especialmente por parte de la Liga de la Defensa Judía.

La noche de la ceremonia, celebrada en el Dorothy Chandler Pavilion de Los Ángeles, la actriz confirmó que no pensaba autocensurarse. Tras agradecer el premio, dedicó el Oscar a quienes lucharon contra el fascismo y denunció lo que calificó como presiones e intimidaciones de un “pequeño grupo de sionistas rufianes”. Sus palabras generaron una reacción inmediata y dividida en la sala, marcando un antes y un después en la relación entre política y espectáculo en Hollywood.

Esta medida impactará en los precios finales de la nafta y el gasoil. Según la normativa, se trata de una actualización que forma parte de un esquema de ajustes periódicos vinculado a la evolución de la inflación, medido por el Índice de Precios al Consumidor (IPC) del Indec.

En el caso de las naftas, el incremento será de 16,773 pesos por litro en el impuesto sobre los combustibles líquidos y de 1,027 pesos en el gravamen al dióxido de carbono. Para el gasoil, la suba será de 14,372 pesos por litro en el impuesto general, 7,782 pesos en la alícuota diferencial aplicada en regiones como la Patagonia y otras zonas del interior, y 1,638 pesos por litro en el impuesto al CO₂.

En ese contexto, su administración planteó a Mercedes-Benz la posibilidad de trasladar su sede central desde Alemania a territorio estadounidense. La propuesta incluía incentivos fiscales y otras ventajas económicas con la idea de “americanizar” la marca y aumentar la presencia de empresas globales con base en EE. UU.

Según explicó Ola Källenius, consejero delegado de Mercedes-Benz, en una entrevista con el medio alemán The Pioneer, la iniciativa fue trasladada formalmente por el entonces secretario de Comercio, Howard Lutnick. Sin embargo, la compañía ni siquiera llegó a estudiar seriamente la opción. La dirección de Mercedes consideró que su identidad histórica y cultural está profundamente ligada a Alemania, país donde nació la marca y donde mantiene su núcleo tecnológico y de decisión.

El joven escritor David Uclés, autor del exitoso libro 'La península de las casas vacías' y reciente ganador del Premio Nadal, rechazó participar en el evento al considerar que el título equiparaba a ambos bandos de la Guerra Civil y diluía la responsabilidad del golpe de Estado franquista, además de objetar la presencia de figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros. Tras su retirada, otros participantes como Antonio Maíllo, María Márquez y la historiadora Zira Box también se bajaron, lo que llevó a la Fundación Cajasol a aplazar el ciclo hasta el otoño.

Las propias comunicaciones del FBI señalaban que muchas de esas informaciones eran denuncias sin corroborar, en algunos casos de segunda mano, y que su existencia no implicaba que fueran creíbles ni que hubieran sido verificadas.

Juan Gascón, candidato de IU y coordinador autonómico, ha afirmado que el proceso de negociación se vio obstaculizado por cambios constantes en las condiciones de Podemos, la falta de reuniones presenciales y demandas que consideraban imposibles, como la supuesta exigencia de abandonar el Gobierno de España para facilitar primarias conjuntas. Por su parte, Podemos niega estas acusaciones y asegura que lo que buscaban eran movimientos que redujeran la subordinación de IU al PSOE. Las conversaciones, lideradas principalmente por Pablo Fernández, secretario de Organización estatal de Podemos, se desarrollaron mayoritariamente por vía telemática, lo que, según IU, complicó alcanzar acuerdos.

La movilización se desarrolló en un contexto de fuerte tensión social tras semanas de operaciones migratorias intensivas en Minnesota, enmarcadas en la llamada Operación Metro Surge.

May, de 78 años, explicó que, en el hipotético caso de que Queen retomara los conciertos en el futuro, Estados Unidos probablemente no figuraría entre los destinos elegidos. El músico lamentó especialmente esta situación, ya que considera que la banda creció artísticamente en América y mantiene un profundo vínculo con el público estadounidense.

Entre las acusaciones figuran el uso reiterado de cuentas oficiales israelíes en redes sociales para lanzar insultos directos contra el presidente Cyril Ramaphosa, así como la omisión intencionada de notificar visitas de altos cargos israelíes al país, lo que se considera un abuso del privilegio diplomático y una infracción clara de la Convención de Viena sobre Relaciones Diplomáticas.

Como represalia, Estados Unidos retirará la certificación de todos los aviones canadienses, incluidos los fabricados por Bombardier, principal fabricante de Canadá. La amenaza de Trump se publicó en su red social Truth Social y se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de tensiones comerciales, ya que la semana pasada advirtió con aranceles del 100% si Canadá firmaba acuerdos con China.

A pesar de que la compañía superó las expectativas de ingresos y beneficios, los mercados han reaccionado con fuerte desconfianza ante el elevado gasto de capital dirigido a infraestructura de inteligencia artificial y el crecimiento más lento de su división de nube, Azure. Las acciones llegaron a caer cerca del 10-12%, borrando cientos de miles de millones de dólares de capitalización bursátil, convirtiéndose en uno de los mayores retrocesos en valor en un solo día en la historia reciente de la empresa. La razón principal detrás de esta reacción negativa es la percepción de que la estrategia agresiva de inversión en IA —incluyendo hardware especializado y dependencia de OpenAI— todavía no está generando retornos claros a corto plazo y presiona los márgenes de beneficio.

Correos electrónicos de 2012 y 2013 muestran intercambios entre Musk y Epstein, así como con Lesley Groff, asistente de Epstein, en los que Musk pregunta sobre fechas y logística para visitar Little St. James. En los mensajes, Musk menciona que viajaría con Talulah Riley, su entonces pareja, y consulta cuándo sería la 'fiesta más salvaje' en la isla. A pesar de estos intercambios, Musk ha declarado públicamente que nunca visitó la isla y que nunca ha sido acusado formalmente de ningún delito relacionado con Epstein. Los correos se produjeron años después de que Epstein fuera condenado en 2008 por delitos sexuales y asegurara un acuerdo favorable que le evitó cargos federales por tráfico sexual. Además, otros correos indican que el hermano de Mus]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/correos-muestran-interes-de-elon-musk-por-visitar-la-isla-privada-de-jeffrey-epstein</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/correos-muestran-interes-de-elon-musk-por-visitar-la-isla-privada-de-jeffrey-epstein</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 22:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España atrae a científicos internacionales procedentes de EEUU mediante el programa ATRAE]]></title><description><![CDATA[España ha reforzado su apuesta por la atracción de talento científico internacional con la tercera edición del programa ATRAE, impulsado por el Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades. Esta convocatoria ha permitido incorporar a 37 investigadores de alto nivel procedentes de distintos países, más de la mitad de ellos vinculados hasta ahora a centros de investigación de Estados Unidos. El contexto político y científico estadounidense, marcado por recortes presupuestarios, censura académica y la eliminación de programas relacionados con la diversidad y el cambio climático durante la Administración Trump, ha provocado un aumento significativo del interés por trasladarse a otros países.

Según los datos oficiales, más de 250 científicos se presentaron a esta edición del programa, con una presencia inédita de candidatos procedentes de EEUU.

Profesores como Eugenia G., nacida y trabajando en Madrid, han tenido que mudarse a localidades cercanas en Valladolid debido a los altos precios del alquiler, lo que les obliga a desplazarse varias horas al día para llegar a sus centros educativos. Esta situación también afecta a interinos, que reciben sueldos insuficientes para cubrir los gastos de vivir en Madrid y a menudo deben compartir piso en condiciones precarias o regresar a sus ciudades de origen. La consecuencia es un creciente éxodo de docentes, lo que deja cientos de plazas sin cubrir y dificulta la estabilidad educativa. Los sindicatos reclaman un complemento de capitalidad similar al de otras grandes ciudades europeas para compensar la diferencia de coste de vida y garantizar que los profesores puedan residir en la capital sin perder poder adquisi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-elevado-coste-de-la-vivienda-obliga-a-muchos-profesores-a-vivir-fuera-de-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-elevado-coste-de-la-vivienda-obliga-a-muchos-profesores-a-vivir-fuera-de-madrid</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La escasez de combustible colapsa la recogida de basura en La Habana y agrava los riesgos sanitarios]]></title><description><![CDATA[La acumulación de basura en La Habana se ha convertido en un problema cotidiano y visible para miles de vecinos, que conviven con montones de residuos en aceras y calzadas. Según relatan residentes de zonas como Centro Habana, la recogida es cada vez más irregular y los desperdicios permanecen días o semanas sin retirarse, generando malos olores y la proliferación de insectos y gusanos. Muchos ciudadanos atribuyen la situación a la falta de combustible para los camiones recolectores y a averías en los vehículos disponibles. 

El Gobierno cubano había anunciado meses atrás una campaña para mejorar la limpieza urbana, presentándola como un punto de inflexión, pero los resultados no se perciben en numerosos barrios.

O’Hara se ganó el cariño de varias generaciones por su versatilidad interpretativa, destacando especialmente por su papel de Moira Rose en la serie 'Schitt’s Creek', que le valió un premio Emmy y un amplio reconocimiento crítico. Antes de eso, había comenzado su carrera en la televisión canadiense con el programa de comedia Second City Television (SCTV), donde también recibió premios por su trabajo humorístico. En cine, participó en títulos emblemáticos como 'Beetlejuice' y su secuela de 2024, así como en películas familiares inolvidables como 'Mi pobre angelito', donde interpretó a la madre del personaje de Macaulay Culkin.

La acusación se centra en que el sitio habría scrapeado ilegalmente 86 millones de archivos de audio y 256 millones de filas de metadatos de pistas musicales de Spotify, lo que representaría casi la totalidad de las grabaciones sonoras comerciales disponibles en el mundo. Según la demanda, presentada el 26 de diciembre de 2025 y desvelada el 16 de enero de 2026, esto equivaldría a unos 151.000 dólares por archivo en daños estatutarios por infracción de derechos de autor.

En ellos, Epstein acusa a Bill Gates de haber contraído una enfermedad de transmisión sexual tras mantener relaciones con 'chicas rusas' y de haberle pedido antibióticos para administrárselos de forma secreta a su entonces esposa, Melinda Gates, sin que ella lo supiera. Estos mensajes forman parte de borradores aparentemente destinados a Boris Nikolic, exasesor de Gates en su fundación, en los que se menciona el fin de la amistad de seis años entre Epstein y Gates, y se alegan otras conductas cuestionables como facilitar encuentros con mujeres casadas o proporcionar Adderall sin prescripción.

La iniciativa implica su inclusión en el Listado de Especies Silvestres en Régimen de Protección Especial y afectaría tanto al ejemplar adulto como a su cría, la angula, cuyo consumo sigue siendo habitual en determinadas zonas de España.

La medida responde a los últimos informes científicos, que describen una situación crítica para la especie. La anguila se encuentra fuera de los límites biológicos de seguridad, con una tendencia regresiva sostenida y un acusado descenso de sus poblaciones desde las décadas de 1970 y 1980. La escasez en los ríos y estuarios, unida a la presión pesquera, la fragmentación de los ecosistemas fluviales y otros factores ambientales, sitúan a la especie al borde de la desaparición.

El menor, que solía usar esa línea para volver a casa, tenía billetes de un carnet anterior de 2,50 euros que ya no eran válidos con las nuevas tarifas, que pueden llegar a 10 euros.

Tras ser obligado a bajar, el niño tuvo que recorrer a pie unos 6 kilómetros de noche, con nieve y temperaturas de alrededor de tres grados bajo cero. Según relata, llegó a casa tras unas dos horas caminando, con síntomas de principio de hipotermia. Su madre afirma que presentaba los labios morados, la ropa mojada y dificultades para hablar, y que su temperatura corporal llegó a 35 grados, algo que respaldan con un certificado médico.

Aunque en 2013 John Kerry había proclamado simbólicamente la muerte de esta doctrina, expertos consultados por la BBC sostienen que nunca desapareció realmente y que hoy vuelve con un tono más explícito y menos disfrazado de valores universales.

El texto explica que la Doctrina Monroe, formulada en 1823 bajo el lema “América para los americanos”, nació para frenar la recolonización europea tras las independencias latinoamericanas.

Tras su liberación, inició un largo proceso judicial para reclamar una indemnización por los daños morales y económicos sufridos, solicitando un total de 217.033 euros. El Ministerio de Justicia denegó inicialmente la petición en 2016, decisión confirmada por la Audiencia Nacional en 2017. Sin embargo, el Tribunal Constitucional estimó su recurso de amparo en 2019 y ordenó revisar el caso respetando los derechos a la igualdad y la presunción de inocencia.

En 2022, el Ministerio reconoció una indemnización de 17.300 euros únicamente por daño moral.

Los hechos se remontan al 18 de enero, cuando Lemon acudió a la iglesia Cities Church, en St. Paul, para documentar una protesta relacionada con las políticas migratorias, el papel del ICE y el asesinato de Renee Good, ocurrido días antes. En ese templo ejerce como pastor un funcionario local del propio ICE, circunstancia que había generado una fuerte contestación social.

Aunque Lemon fue arrestado en Los Ángeles, donde se encontraba cubriendo la entrega de los premios Grammy, su abogado, Abbe Lowell, sostiene que el periodista actuaba exclusivamente en el ejercicio de su labor profesional y no tenía ninguna vinculación con el grupo que interrumpió el servicio religioso. De hecho, un juez había rechazado previamente la solicitud de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detencion-del-periodista-don-lemon-tras-cubrir-una-protesta-contra-el-ice-en-una-iglesia-de-minnesota</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detencion-del-periodista-don-lemon-tras-cubrir-una-protesta-contra-el-ice-en-una-iglesia-de-minnesota</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Presentación de la red 'Danon Eskola Publikoa' en Busturia para defender la escuela pública en Urdaibai ante el descenso demográfico]]></title><description><![CDATA[El sábado 31 de enero de 2026 se presentó en la Ekoetxea de Busturia la plataforma 'Danon Eskola Publikoa', una red comarcal que une a 26 centros educativos públicos de nueve municipios de la zona de Urdaibai y Busturialdea (desde Bermeo hasta Gernika y Zornotza). Impulsada por trece asociaciones de familias y AMPAs, con el respaldo de los propios centros, equipos directivos, ayuntamientos y más de 700 docentes, representa a unas 4.000 familias y 5.000 alumnos. Su objetivo principal es coordinar esfuerzos locales para fortalecer la educación pública, compartir recursos, dar visibilidad a las escuelas pequeñas y defenderla frente a los retos actuales, especialmente el invierno demográfico que provoca cierres de líneas y fusiones.

Las portavoces, como Eider Bilbao (directora de Bermeoko Herri Eskola) y Nahia Idoiaga (profesora en la UPV/EHU y madre de alumnado), denuncian que los ajustes por la caída de la natalidad no se aplican de forma equitativa y benefician a la red concertada, que]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-de-la-red-danon-eskola-publikoa-en-busturia-para-defender-la-escuela-publica-en-urdaibai-ante-el-descenso-demografico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-de-la-red-danon-eskola-publikoa-en-busturia-para-defender-la-escuela-publica-en-urdaibai-ante-el-descenso-demografico</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Por qué el trumpismo ha evolucionado hacia un modelo de gobierno claramente fascista]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Jonathan Rauch sostiene que, tras años evitando el término por su uso abusivo y su definición imprecisa, ya no es posible esquivar la palabra “fascismo” para describir el modelo de gobierno de Donald Trump en su segundo mandato. El autor parte de una posición inicialmente prudente: durante años consideró que Trump encajaba mejor en el patrimonialismo, una forma de gobernar basada en tratar el Estado como propiedad personal y exigir lealtad al líder. Sin embargo, Rauch argumenta que ese diagnóstico se ha quedado corto ante la deriva ideológica, represiva y sistemática del trumpismo reciente.

El texto enumera una constelación de rasgos característicos del fascismo contemporáneo que, en conjunto, dibujan un patrón coherente. Entre ellos destaca la demolición deliberada de normas democráticas y de la decencia cívica, el uso performativo y propagandístico de la violencia, y la glorificación del poder y la fuerza como principios políticos.

Esta normativa establece que todos los centros deberán contar con al menos 4.500 estudiantes, una oferta académica amplia y variada, y un profesorado del cual el 75% resida en España o Europa. Además, introduce nuevas exigencias administrativas destinadas a asegurar estándares mínimos de calidad. Cinco universidades —la española Universidad de las Hespérides y cuatro centros extranjeros (CIS, Schiller, Saint Louis y Francisco Marroquín)— habían presentado un recurso pidiendo que se suspendieran algunas disposiciones del decreto, alegando que las nuevas obligaciones limitarían su capacidad de competir y que el plazo para adaptarse era insuficiente.

El autor utiliza este suceso para cuestionar no solo la gestión sanitaria, sino también la manera en que los medios y la sociedad jerarquizan las muertes según su relevancia informativa.

El texto sostiene que a la sanidad pública no se le exige la inmortalidad, sino una atención de calidad y, llegado el momento, una muerte digna. En el caso relatado, ninguna de las dos cosas se cumplió. La gerencia sanitaria se disculpó alegando una situación puntual de sobrecarga asistencial y afirmó que el fallecimiento era “probablemente inevitable”, una expresión que el autor critica por considerarla una forma de diluir responsabilidades.

El autor sostiene que no basta con atribuir este fenómeno a la ignorancia o a la manipulación puntual, sino que hay que entenderlo como resultado de una estrategia cultural y comunicativa sostenida en el tiempo. La ultraderecha, explica, ha sabido disputar la hegemonía cultural utilizando un nuevo lenguaje y adaptándose a las reglas del juego democrático para presentar sus ideas como una opción política legítima más.

Según el texto, estas fuerzas políticas logran conectar con emociones profundas como el miedo, la ansiedad o la sensación de pérdida de estatus, ofreciendo “lugares seguros” simbólicos: identidad nacional, tradición, religión, roles de género o pertenencia cultural. Estos elementos proporcionan sensación de orden y comunidad en contextos de incertidumbre económica y social.

No obstante, la resolución municipal reconoció que el comportamiento del portavoz fue inapropiado. Abascal envió un mensaje directo a Pons instándole a no dimitir, dejando claro que solo él podría pedirlo.

Sin embargo, el texto recuerda que el mismo partido bloqueó sistemáticamente, durante su etapa en el Gobierno y en oposición en Galicia y el Congreso, cualquier comisión similar para el accidente de Angrois en 2013, que dejó 80 muertos cerca de Santiago de Compostela.

Según la carta, esta reedición no incorpora revisiones de fondo ni dialoga con investigaciones posteriores que habrían cuestionado sus conclusiones.

Los firmantes sostienen que existe abundante documentación y testimonios que contradicen el relato tradicional sobre los hechos de Bellver y la muerte del anarquista Antonio Martín Escudero. Afirman que no hubo una batalla abierta, sino una emboscada con motivaciones políticas, y acusan a Solé i Sabaté de citar documentos sin analizarlos en profundidad cuando estos ponen en duda su versión.

Tizona Comunicación SL fue fundada en 2018 por Gabriel Ariza, hijo de Julio Ariza, conocido empresario de medios y creador de Intereconomía.

La rectificación llegó de la mano de Alma Ezcurra, vicesecretaria de Coordinación Sectorial del PP y eurodiputada, durante una entrevista en Radio Nacional de España.

Este incremento eleva el SMI hasta los 1.424 euros brutos mensuales en 12 pagas, lo que equivale aproximadamente a 1.221 euros en 14 pagas y a unos 17.094 euros brutos anuales. La decisión descarta una propuesta alternativa de subida mayor, del 4,7 %, que habría implicado la obligación de tributar por IRPF.

En el caso de las empleadas de hogar, el nuevo SMI servirá como base para recalcular salarios mensuales, sueldos por horas y cotizaciones, especialmente relevantes en un sector donde abundan los contratos a tiempo parcial. Aunque el salario mínimo seguirá exento de IRPF para quienes solo perciban esa renta, Hacienda recomienda presentar la Declaración de la Renta si ha habido retenciones, ya que podrían existir devoluciones o deducciones aplicables a rentas bajas.

El hecho ocurrió tras una operación de ICE en Minneapolis el 9 de enero, en la que cuatro miembros de la tribu fueron detenidos inicialmente; uno fue liberado y los otros tres permanecieron en el centro de Fort Snelling. Líderes tribales, encabezados por el presidente Frank Star Comes Out, han calificado la detención de ilegal, argumentando que estos individuos son ciudadanos estadounidenses por ley y miembros de la nación Oglala Sioux por tratado, por lo que no deberían estar sujetos a medidas de control migratorio. La tribu ha exigido su liberación inmediata y ha negado haber firmado ningún acuerdo de inmigración con ICE, mientras reclama información sobre la base legal de las detenciones.

La Comisión de Garantía y Evaluación de Catalunya aprobó su solicitud en julio de 2024 y fijó la fecha para el 2 de agosto de ese año, pero el procedimiento quedó paralizado por un recurso judicial presentado por su padre, representado por la organización Abogados Cristianos. Tras varios litigios, el Tribunal Supremo ha desestimado el recurso del padre al considerar que carece de interés casacional objetivo, ya que las pruebas médicas y periciales ya fueron valoradas en instancias anteriores. Tres tribunales han avalado la capacidad de Noelia para decidir y el cumplimiento de los requisitos legales.

De forma similar, las grasas presentes en el aceite de oliva y la leche forman micelas que facilitan la disolución y el transporte de vitaminas liposolubles (A, D, E y K), que de otro modo pasarían sin absorberse. El profesor David Julian McClements explica que muchos nutrientes quedan atrapados en la matriz alimentaria y requieren masticación o grasa para liberarse y absorberse adecuadamente. Esto es especialmente relevante para personas con problemas de malabsorción, como enfermedad celíaca, Crohn o pancreatitis.

La citación estaba fijada para las 13:00 horas, pero el artista no acudió y justificó su ausencia alegando retrasos ferroviarios desde Madrid, pese a que las incidencias en el servicio eran conocidas con antelación.

La demanda se produce tras la publicación de un primer testimonio anónimo de violencia sexual difundido por Fallarás y la posterior aparición de numerosos relatos similares en distintos espacios digitales. Hasta 80 mujeres han denunciado episodios de abusos y violencia sexual que atribuyen al artista, describiendo patrones repetidos de abuso de poder en contextos vinculados a su entorno profesional.

Destacan dos casos principales: una factura de 411.400 euros a través de Publick Worldwide SL (empresa de la que tomó control en 2019) durante las elecciones generales, y otra de 320.000 euros como autónomo en las europeas de 2024, ambas sin especificar los trabajos ante el Tribunal de Cuentas.

El autor sostiene que miles de ancianos murieron sin recibir atención sanitaria adecuada como consecuencia de unos protocolos que impedían su derivación a hospitales públicos, mientras que quienes disponían de seguros privados sí podían acceder a atención médica. Esta diferencia de trato es presentada como uno de los episodios más graves y éticamente reprochables de la crisis sanitaria.

El texto hace referencia al documental “7291”, de Juanjo Castro, que recoge testimonios directos sobre lo ocurrido en las residencias madrileñas y que, según el autor, evidencia la magnitud del abandono sufrido por los mayores.

El autor critica la romantización de los crímenes coloniales a través de la industria del entretenimiento, como Hollywood, que convirtió en epopeyas heroicas episodios de violencia, racismo y explotación, citando películas como 'Lawrence de Arabia', 'Zulú' o 'Victoria y Abdul'. Destaca el orgullo persistente en Reino Unido por su pasado imperial, respaldado por encuestas y libros que lo presentan como motor de progreso, pese a su legado de conflictos en excolonias.

Poch describe el imperio británico como una dictadura militar con represión constante, deportaciones masivas (162.000 convictos a Australia entre 1788 y 1868) y masacres a poblaciones indígenas.

Esta iniciativa surge en un contexto marcado por la presidencia de Donald Trump, la amenaza de una guerra comercial y las advertencias de informes clave elaborados por Mario Draghi y Enrico Letta sobre la debilidad estructural del mercado de capitales europeo.

Uno de los principales problemas detectados es que los hogares europeos mantienen una parte muy elevada de su riqueza en depósitos y efectivo, con baja rentabilidad, mientras que la inversión en renta variable es reducida en comparación con Estados Unidos. Aunque las familias de la UE ahorran más en términos absolutos, esos recursos no se traducen en mayor riqueza ni en un impulso suficiente a la economía productiva europea.

Tras su integración en Mediaset, la cadena perdió gradualmente esa identidad alternativa para adoptar un enfoque más conservador, comercial y orientado a audiencias amplias, similar al de Telecinco. El autor critica especialmente el actual dominio en la parrilla de Iker Jiménez y Nacho Abad, que juntos ocupan más de veinte horas semanales con programas como 'Horizonte', 'En boca de todos' y 'Código 10'. Describe a ambos presentadores como poco moderados, populistas y demagógicos, que utilizan un discurso enfadado y simplista para atraer a un público predispuesto a teorías conspirativas, alarmismo y posturas de ultraderecha.

El acto, solicitado por la presidenta regional Isabel Díaz Ayuso al Arzobispado de Madrid, fue cuestionado por sectores que lo interpretaron como un gesto de protagonismo institucional y por el contraste con la ausencia de homenajes similares a otras tragedias, como las muertes en residencias durante la pandemia.

Tras el funeral, las redes sociales recuperaron antiguos vídeos de Ayuso, especialmente una intervención en el programa ‘El gato al agua’, en la que afirmaba explícitamente no ser creyente.

Para lograrlo, se propone el uso de sistemas automáticos capaces de analizar textos, imágenes y archivos.

El principal punto de fricción es el método técnico necesario para aplicar estas medidas.

Según la Ordenanza de Movilidad de Madrid, los vehículos que no superan los 40 km/h no requieren permisos especiales, lo que ha permitido su expansión sin controles estrictos. Esto genera ventajas para los operadores (flexibilidad y atractivo turístico), pero también conflictos: los taxistas denuncian competencia desleal, los vecinos se quejan por congestión, aparcamientos irregulares y conductas irresponsables en zonas peatonales o semáforos.

Los trabajadores han colocado barricadas de neumáticos en los accesos y han intensificado las protestas con hogueras, bengalas, tracas, gritos y lanzamiento de huevos y harina, especialmente contra los directivos que entran o salen de la planta. Estos directivos acceden en convoyes de coches protegidos por antidisturbios y Guardia Civil debido a la alta tensión registrada en esos momentos. La huelga responde a un Expediente de Regulación de Empleo (ERE) propuesto por la empresa, que implica la supresión de 96 puestos de trabajo y afecta potencialmente a 184 personas (casi la mitad de los 368 empleados directos), mediante recolocaciones, jubilaciones anticipadas y otras medidas en el marco de un Plan de Eficiencia y Competitividad para 2026-2027, justificado por la compañía por]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/huelga-en-la-fabrica-de-ence-en-navia-tension-con-barricadas-y-proteccion-policial-a-directivos-durante-el-ere</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/huelga-en-la-fabrica-de-ence-en-navia-tension-con-barricadas-y-proteccion-policial-a-directivos-durante-el-ere</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las residencias denuncian que el nuevo decreto madrileño de dependencia aumenta la burocracia y dificulta el acceso a derechos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Plataforma por la Dignidad de las Personas Mayores en las Residencias (Pladigmare) ha presentado alegaciones contra el nuevo decreto del Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid que modifica el acceso y el procedimiento del Sistema para la Autonomía y Atención a la Dependencia (SAAD). Según la asociación, la norma, impulsada por el Ejecutivo de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, lejos de simplificar trámites y mejorar la atención, introduce más burocracia y genera situaciones que consideran injustas y deshumanizadoras para las personas dependientes y sus familias.

Uno de los aspectos más criticados es la introducción del silencio administrativo negativo. El decreto establece que, si no hay una resolución expresa en seis meses, la solicitud se considerará desestimada. Pladigmare advierte de que esta medida puede dejar sin derechos a miles de personas mayores, ya que la Comunidad de Madrid tarda actualmente una media de 221 días en reconocer el grado de dependencia y 364 días en conceder la prestación, se]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-residencias-denuncian-que-el-nuevo-decreto-madrileno-de-dependencia-aumenta-la-burocracia-y-dificulta-el-acceso-a-derechos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-residencias-denuncian-que-el-nuevo-decreto-madrileno-de-dependencia-aumenta-la-burocracia-y-dificulta-el-acceso-a-derechos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Hospital de Sant Pau de Barcelona sigue sin realizar abortos pese a la ley catalana]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Hospital de Sant Pau de Barcelona no practica abortos desde 2012 debido a presiones religiosas, a pesar de que la ley catalana permite la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo de forma legal y gratuita desde 2010.

Aunque el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, a través de Barcelona en Comú, presentó en 2025 una proposición para garantizar el derecho al aborto en Sant Pau, la medida implementada consiste únicamente en derivaciones a otros centros, como el hospital Dos de Maig, lo que para las activistas representa una solución insuficiente y parcial.

Según la dirección europea de la compañía, la reflexión se encuentra en una etapa inicial y forma parte de un proyecto de transformación de las funciones de soporte. Entre las opciones planteadas figura la creación de un hub de servicios empresariales en India y el refuerzo del centro de excelencia que el grupo ya opera en Polonia.

La aplicación no es completamente nativa, ya que se trata de la versión web empaquetada mediante Electron u otra tecnología similar, un enfoque que puede generar debate, pero cuyo impacto práctico resulta positivo.

La principal ventaja frente a la versión web es el acceso real a las prestaciones avanzadas de GeForce Now. Con la aplicación oficial, los usuarios pueden alcanzar mayores tasas de bits, resoluciones mucho más altas y tasas de refresco significativamente superiores.

Esta medida, aunque prevista desde hace tiempo debido a la antigüedad y baja eficiencia del modelo, se ha acelerado tras el accidente del vuelo 2976 en Louisville el pasado 4 de noviembre. A raíz de este incidente, la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA) de Estados Unidos ordenó la inmovilización de todos los MD-11 y DC-10, sus predecesores. La retirada supondrá para UPS una amortización de 137 millones de dólares después de impuestos y costeará la formación de tripulaciones y personal de mantenimiento en otros modelos o, en algunos casos, despedir empleados.

Estas cifras se refieren a muertes directas por ataques militares y no incluyen desaparecidos bajo los escombros ni fallecimientos derivados de hambre, frío, enfermedades o el colapso del sistema sanitario. Hasta ahora, las autoridades israelíes habían desacreditado estos datos, calificándolos de propaganda, aunque organismos internacionales y expertos independientes habían considerado que el sistema de registro gazatí era metodológicamente sólido.

En este último ámbito, las detenciones bajaron un 35% respecto al año anterior, lo que apunta a una reducción relevante en ese tipo de criminalidad.

El documento, solicitado por Vox a la Consejería de Interior del Gobierno de Navarra, indica que dos tercios de los delitos registrados en la Comunidad Foral son cometidos por personas extranjeras. También destaca un aumento de detenidos de nacionalidad extranjera, con especial presencia de personas procedentes de Marruecos y, en menor medida, de Argelia, Rumanía, Colombia y Perú. Aun así, España continúa siendo el país con mayor número de detenidos en términos absolutos, con 199, aunque esta cifra supone un 15% menos que en 2024.

El autor denuncia cómo esta práctica degrada el debate público en España, fomentando la polarización y erosionando la confianza en los medios. Se mencionan ejemplos de programas de tertulia donde se emplean metáforas bélicas para describir enfrentamientos verbales, lo que contribuye a un clima de confrontación constante.

Sánchez replicó con ironía: 'Marte puede esperar.

El saldo negativo de la balanza comercial creció un 94,6 % hasta situarse en 56.800 millones de dólares, lo que supone la mayor variación desde marzo de 1992. Este deterioro se explica principalmente por el incremento de las importaciones, que subieron un 5 % hasta 348.900 millones de dólares.

Dentro de las compras al exterior, destacó el aumento de las importaciones de bienes, especialmente las de bienes de capital, que alcanzaron un máximo histórico tras incrementarse en 7.400 millones de dólares.

Según explicó en Córdoba, cerrar los centros educativos cada vez que se activa una alerta de este nivel supondría, en la práctica, clausurar colegios “todos los días”, algo incompatible con la prestación de un servicio público esencial como es la educación.

Castillo subrayó que las decisiones sobre cierres se toman valorando el riesgo real para el alumnado y el personal educativo, y no únicamente la existencia de una alerta meteorológica. En este sentido, recordó que durante el episodio más reciente se cerraron de manera preventiva 779 centros educativos en Andalucía, especialmente en las provincias de Almería, Málaga y Cádiz, precisamente allí donde l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-junta-defiende-mantener-abiertos-los-colegios-ante-alertas-naranjas-si-no-existe-riesgo-real</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-junta-defiende-mantener-abiertos-los-colegios-ante-alertas-naranjas-si-no-existe-riesgo-real</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El jefe de diseño de Audi critica el exceso de pantallas táctiles y apuesta por recuperar botones físicos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El jefe de diseño de Audi, Massimo Frascella, ha declarado en una entrevista a Top Gear que las grandes pantallas táctiles no ofrecen la mejor experiencia en los coches, calificándolas como 'tecnología por meter tecnología'. Frascella enfatiza la importancia de la tactilidad y aboga por una combinación equilibrada entre elementos analógicos y digitales para mejorar la percepción de calidad. Señala que incluir pantallas excesivas puede generar una sensación de calidad barata, algo que los clientes han criticado en redes sociales respecto a modelos recientes de la marca, como aquellos con acabados en negro piano y múltiples pantallas. El directivo menciona el Audi Concept C, presentado el año pasado, como una referencia clave para los futuros diseños, donde las pantallas se integran de forma más discreta (por ejemplo, pudiendo ocultarse) y se recuperan controles físicos precisos, incluyendo el característico 'clic de Audi' y materiales metálicos.

El asesor jurídico del grupo, Jeff Rath, afirmó que se reunieron con «personas de muy alto nivel» y que algunos asistentes abandonaban las reuniones para ir directamente a la Oficina Oval. El grupo separatista se muestra muy optimista y asegura que Estados Unidos está «muy entusiasmado» con la idea de una Alberta independiente. Planean solicitar en una próxima reunión una línea de crédito de 500.000 millones de dólares para preparar la hipotética independencia.

Esta cifra supone un descenso respecto al 40 % de septiembre y al 38 % de agosto anteriores. La desaprobación de su gestión alcanza el 61 %. Además, el 50 % de los encuestados considera que las acciones de su Administración han sido peores de lo esperado, frente a solo el 21 % que opina que han sido mejores. El apoyo a sus políticas también ha disminuido: únicamente el 27 % respalda todas o la mayoría, mientras que el 52 % apoya pocas o ninguna. La caída en el respaldo proviene exclusivamente de los republicanos, donde el apoyo a sus planes ha bajado del 67 % al 56 %.

El cambio se realizará de forma progresiva y está previsto que la nueva plataforma, denominada Visio, esté plenamente implantada en todos los departamentos gubernamentales en 2027.

La decisión se enmarca en la estrategia francesa de reforzar la soberanía digital y reducir la dependencia de proveedores tecnológicos extranjeros, especialmente de Estados Unidos.

Garzón sostiene que el mundo se encamina hacia un escenario de creciente violencia e injusticia si se mantienen los actuales patrones de producción y consumo, dominados por una lógica de competencia por recursos cada vez más escasos.

Según el economista, la política exterior de potencias como Estados Unidos no puede entenderse solo desde la personalidad de líderes como Donald Trump, sino desde factores estructurales ligados a la necesidad de asegurar el acceso a recursos estratégicos como minerales críticos o combustibles fósiles.

El acto fue promovido por la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, quien lo justificó como un homenaje compartido por todos los españoles, argumentando que el dolor era nacional y no solo andaluz, pese a que la mayoría de las víctimas procedían de Huelva. Ayuso solicitó al Arzobispado de Madrid la celebración de esta eucaristía para mostrar solidaridad y acompañamiento a las familias.

En este contexto surgen iniciativas inmobiliarias que buscan ofrecer alquileres más bajos a cambio de reducir el tamaño de las viviendas. Una de estas propuestas es el modelo de los llamados minipisos, impulsado por el inversor inmobiliario Quique Escrivá, de 47 años, propietario de 20 viviendas de pequeño formato y actualmente en proceso de construcción de otras nueve más.

Estas viviendas, con superficies que oscilan entre los 25 y los 40 metros cuadrados, están diseñadas para una sola persona y priorizan el aprovechamiento del espacio frente a la amplitud. Según Escrivá, los alquileres se sitúan entre los 400 y los 500 euros mensuales, un precio que equipara al coste de una habitación en zonas céntricas de grandes ciudades como Valencia o Madrid, pero ofreciendo un espacio independiente.

La denuncia sostiene que las promesas de la plataforma, según las cuales nadie salvo emisor y receptor puede leer los mensajes, serían engañosas. Según la demanda, supuestos denunciantes internos afirman que empleados de Meta podrían solicitar acceso a mensajes de WhatsApp mediante sistemas internos y, una vez aprobado, visualizar contenidos casi en tiempo real y también históricos, sin un paso adicional de descifrado.

Meta ha rechazado tajantemente estas acusaciones. Un portavoz declaró que cualquier afirmación de que los mensajes de WhatsApp no están cifrados es falsa y absurda, y recordó que la aplicación utiliza desde hace años el protocolo Signal para su cifrado de extremo a extremo.

Su nombre suele relacionarse con la purificación y con la lactancia de las ovejas, un signo claro de renovación y de retorno de la vida a los campos. En las sociedades celtas, Imbolc estaba profundamente ligada a los ciclos de la naturaleza y a la observación del entorno, que guiaban tanto la economía rural como la espiritualidad.

Uno de los elementos centrales de Imbolc era el culto a Brigid, diosa asociada al fuego, la poesía, la curación y la fertilidad. Durante esta festividad se encendían hogueras y velas como símbolos de luz creciente, protección y limpieza espiritual. También eran habituales los rituales de purificación del hogar y de las personas, así como las peticiones de prosperidad para la nueva temporada agrícola.

La renta media ha alcanzado máximos históricos que chocan directamente con el nivel de solvencia de los hogares.

Los indicadores de esfuerzo financiero sitúan el gasto en vivienda por encima del 40 % de los ingresos netos en grandes capitales como Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia y Málaga, muy por encima del 30 % recomendado por organismos reguladores y el Banco de España.

Según los datos del Observatorio Galego da Vivenda presentados por la alcaldesa Inés Rey en Radio Coruña, esta evolución contrasta con el alza continuada en otras ciudades gallegas como Vigo o Pontevedra. Lejos de contraerse, el mercado ha mostrado dinamismo: en el último año se firmaron casi cien contratos más y en enero se registraron 421 nuevos contratos, liderando Galicia. La alcaldesa atribuye este resultado a medidas como desgravaciones fiscales para propietarios, mayor control de viviendas turísticas y un índice de referencia de precios que informa a los inquilinos.

Hasta ahora, cuando un festivo caía en sábado, muchos empleados con jornada de lunes a viernes lo perdían de facto. Sin embargo, el Alto Tribunal establece que los festivos y los descansos semanales son derechos distintos y no pueden solaparse sin compensación, ya que eso generaría un agravio comparativo entre trabajadores con diferentes turnos.

Según el artículo 37 del Estatuto de los Trabajadores, los festivos tienen carácter retribuido y no recuperable. Además, el Real Decreto 2001/1983 señala que, si por razones técnicas u organizativas no puede disfrutarse un festivo o descanso semanal, la empresa debe compensarlo económicamente —con un incremento mínimo del 75%— o con descanso alternativo. La sentencia parte de una demanda sindical contra una empresa textil que consideraba como “disfrutado” un festivo que coincidía con el dí]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-supremo-fija-que-los-festivos-que-coincidan-con-el-dia-libre-deben-compensarse-con-otro-descanso</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-supremo-fija-que-los-festivos-que-coincidan-con-el-dia-libre-deben-compensarse-con-otro-descanso</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El FBI incauta papeletas y registros electorales de las elecciones de 2020 en Fulton County]]></title><description><![CDATA[Agentes del FBI llevaron a cabo el miércoles un registro en el almacén del Centro de Operaciones Electorales del condado de Fulton, Georgia, bajo una orden judicial que autorizaba la incautación de todas las papeletas físicas de las elecciones de 2020, las imágenes de las papeletas y los registros de votantes del condado. Este condado, que incluye gran parte de la ciudad de Atlanta, fue un foco de las acusaciones infundadas de Donald Trump sobre un supuesto fraude electoral en 2020. Autoridades locales y miembros de la junta electoral han asegurado que las elecciones fueron transparentes, precisas y auditadas, y han expresado su preocupación sobre la seguridad de las papeletas tras la intervención del FBI. Líderes políticos reaccionaron de manera polarizada: mientras el Partido Republicano de Georgia celebró la acción, figuras demócratas y expertos en derechos electorales la calificaron de intento de socavar la confianza en las elecciones y atacar un bastión democrático.

Esta subida supone un aumento de 37 euros mensuales respecto a los 1.184 euros actuales, equivalente a 518 euros más al año. La medida beneficiará aproximadamente a 2,5 millones de trabajadores y se aplicará con efectos retroactivos desde el 1 de enero de 2026. Además, se mantiene la exención en el IRPF para quienes cobran el SMI.

El pacto se ha cerrado sin la participación de las patronales CEOE y Cepyme, que han rechazado tanto la subida como la ayuda fiscal propuesta por el Gobierno (una deducción en el Impuesto de Sociedades condicionada al aumento de salarios por encima del SMI). Las organizaciones empresariales han criticado duramente la decisión y han anunciado posibles recursos judiciales, especialmente por el compromiso de reformar la norma]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gobierno-y-sindicatos-pactan-subir-el-smi-un-3-1-hasta-1-221-euros-en-2026-sin-acuerdo-con-la-patronal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gobierno-y-sindicatos-pactan-subir-el-smi-un-3-1-hasta-1-221-euros-en-2026-sin-acuerdo-con-la-patronal</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La psicología explica por qué los finales felices de los 80 y 90 distorsionaron nuestra idea de la felicidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[La psicología contemporánea señala que muchas personas que crecieron durante las décadas de 1980 y 1990 interiorizaron una visión poco realista de la felicidad, fuertemente influida por relatos culturales basados en finales felices. Películas infantiles, cuentos clásicos y comedias románticas transmitieron de forma reiterada la idea de que alcanzar determinados hitos —como encontrar el amor, formar una familia o lograr estabilidad económica— garantizaba una felicidad permanente.

El profesor Tal Ben-Shahar, experto en psicología positiva de la Universidad de Harvard, denomina a esta creencia “la falacia de la llegada”. Se trata de una distorsión cognitiva que lleva a pensar que el malestar desaparecerá una vez alcanzado un objetivo concreto. Según este enfoque, la felicidad se concibe erróneamente como un punto de llegada definitivo, cuando en realidad es un estado emocional cambiante y condicionado por múltiples factores biológicos y psicológicos.

Diversos estudios respaldan esta ide]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-psicologia-explica-por-que-los-finales-felices-de-los-80-y-90-distorsionaron-nuestra-idea-de-la-felicidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-psicologia-explica-por-que-los-finales-felices-de-los-80-y-90-distorsionaron-nuestra-idea-de-la-felicidad</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Archivada la causa contra el jesuita Francesc Peris por prescripción de los delitos de abusos sexuales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El exprofesor jesuita Francesc Peris no será juzgado en España por los presuntos abusos sexuales cometidos contra menores durante décadas, después de que la Fiscalía haya determinado que los delitos han prescrito. El juzgado había abierto diligencias a raíz de dos denuncias presentadas por exalumnos del colegio Casp de Barcelona, relativas a hechos ocurridos en 1999 y 2004, al considerar inicialmente que podían ser perseguidos penalmente. Sin embargo, el Ministerio Público concluyó que los hechos más recientes ya no son legalmente perseguibles, lo que anticipa el archivo definitivo también del resto de denuncias.

Con esta decisión judicial se cierra la última vía para sentar en el banquillo a Peris, a quien las víctimas describen como una persona manipuladora y con un comportamiento abusivo reiterado. Según los testimonios recopilados, las agresiones habrían afectado a un número indeterminado de niños y niñas tanto en centros educativos de Barcelona como en Cochabamba, Bolivia.

La ceremonia estuvo presidida por el obispo de Huelva, Santiago Gómez Sierra, y contó con la asistencia de los Reyes de España, así como de autoridades locales, autonómicas y representantes del Gobierno.

Durante el desarrollo del acto, los informativos de la Cadena SER emitieron una conexión en directo para informar sobre la entrada del cortejo litúrgico. En ese contexto, una locutora protagonizó un lapsus verbal al anunciar erróneamente que “sus majestades los Reyes Magos aún no han entrado”, cuando en realidad se refería a los Reyes de España. El error, emitido en el informativo de las 18:00 horas, fue rápidamente identificado como una confusión involuntaria propia de las retransmisiones en directo.
