Serving as U.S. Vice President under George W. Bush, Cheney played a central role in the post-9/11 'war on terror,' promoting the Iraq War under claims of weapons of mass destruction and alleged links to Al Qaeda, both of which were unfounded. Earlier, as Secretary of Defense and a congressman, he supported controversial military actions in Panama, Iraq, and Nicaragua, often defending or downplaying human rights violations. Cheney also endorsed programs of domestic and international surveillance, indefinite detention, and torture, citing the president's authority. Critics accuse him of facilitating civilian casualties, authoritarian policies, and global instability. Cheney's tenure at Halliburton and his role in the Project for a New American Century illustrate his continued influence on U.S. foreign policy and milita]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-analysis-of-dick-cheney-s-political-career-and-controversial-legacy</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-analysis-of-dick-cheney-s-political-career-and-controversial-legacy</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 02:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tensions Rise Amid U.S. Naval Movements Near Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article from MPR21 portrays escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela, describing an atmosphere of psychological warfare rather than an imminent military confrontation. It reports that President Nicolás Maduro celebrated his 63rd birthday while a U.S. naval fleet, led by the aircraft carrier Gerald R. Ford, was deployed in the Caribbean, allegedly ready for a new phase of operations. The piece suggests that Washington’s actions are intended to intimidate Caracas and emphasizes that the U.S. government, under Trump, is considering several tactical options, ranging from targeted strikes on supposed 'terrorist' or 'narcotrafficker' sites to full-scale intervention—though the latter is viewed as unlikely. The article cites sources like Reuters and The New York Times, noting secret negotiations between both governments. It also accuses the U.S. of hypocrisy, arguing that its imperial behavior prevents equal negotiations. Meanwhile, right-wing U.S. congresswoman María S]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-rise-amid-u-s-naval-movements-near-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-rise-amid-u-s-naval-movements-near-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 02:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Economic Constraints Are Forcing an End to the War in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article discusses how economic factors are central to the continuation and eventual end of wars, particularly the Ukraine conflict. It argues that Ukraine cannot win the war against Russia because Europe can no longer finance it. Many European Union countries have accumulated excessive deficits and debts. The IMF warns that skyrocketing public debt is forcing European governments to reconsider labor rights and social benefits, pushing them towards drastic cuts. Despite announced general strikes in countries like Portugal, Belgium, and France, the article suggests these may be insufficient, especially as unions allegedly conceal the financial burden of European rearmament from workers. The article highlights the doubling of Europe's debt-to-GDP ratio, with several large economies like Spain, Italy, and France exceeding 100%. The US also faces an enormous national debt, surpassing its GDP, with China reducing its holdings of US Treasury bonds, signaling shifting global financial pow]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/economic-constraints-are-forcing-an-end-to-the-war-in-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/economic-constraints-are-forcing-an-end-to-the-war-in-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 22:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Thirteen Dead and Multiple Injured in Major Residential Fire in Hong Kong’s Tai Po District]]></title><description><![CDATA[A devastating fire broke out on Wednesday in the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Hong Kong’s Tai Po district, resulting in at least 13 fatalities, including a firefighter, and leaving more than 15 people critically injured. According to authorities, the blaze began in one of the residential blocks before spreading rapidly across bamboo scaffolding that connected seven of the estate’s eight buildings. Thick plumes of smoke filled the air as flames engulfed multiple floors, trapping numerous residents inside their homes. Police reported receiving several emergency calls from individuals unable to escape, including cases of unconscious residents suffering from severe burns.

Fire services initially classified the blaze as a No. 1 alarm incident, but it quickly escalated to No. 4 by mid-afternoon and ultimately reached the highest severity level, No. 5, by early evening. Video footage from the scene showed scaffolding and green mesh burning intensely, with debris falling to the ground as ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/thirteen-dead-and-multiple-injured-in-major-residential-fire-in-hong-kong-s-tai-po-district</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/thirteen-dead-and-multiple-injured-in-major-residential-fire-in-hong-kong-s-tai-po-district</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 18:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Campaign to Restore Bathroom Doors in Hotels to Protect Guest Privacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[A traveler, frustrated by frequent encounters with hotels that lack proper bathroom doors or have glass doors that don't provide privacy, has created the website BringBackDoors.com to address this issue. The site provides a searchable database of hotels confirmed to have bathroom doors that close fully and are not made of glass, allowing travelers to find accommodations that guarantee privacy. The campaign involves publicly naming and shaming hotels that eliminate or compromise bathroom doors in the name of aesthetics or cost savings. The movement highlights a growing trend among hotels, including some luxury ones, to remove traditional bathroom doors as a design choice intended to save space or enhance the look of rooms, often sacrificing guest dignity and comfort. Travelers are encouraged to report hotels with inadequate bathroom doors by emailing or sending photos via social media for inclusion on the site's list.

The decision, made in September, follows the European Commission's proposal to suspend the trade-related elements of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Although the retailer’s stock of Israeli products has been limited—primarily excluding fresh fruit and vegetables—some items, such as home carbonation devices, will continue to be sold until current inventory is depleted. Nina Elomaa, the Chief Sustainability Officer of S Group, emphasized that the company is actively monitoring peace negotiations and EU policies, and will adjust its decision as necessary. The S Group operates several well-known retail chains in Finland, including S-Market, Prisma, Varuboden, Sokos, Alepa, and Sale, and currently holds a 49% market share in the Finnish grocery sector.

Many were detained during a February 2024 raid on Nasser Hospital in Gaza and face extremely harsh imprisonment conditions such as physical violence, medical neglect, and starvation. Detained doctors, including senior specialists and hospital directors, remain cut off from regular family contact and legal visits are infrequent. Their families endure extreme hardship, with many displaced and struggling to support themselves as Gaza's healthcare system collapses. The detained doctors are accused of no wrongdoing and were primarily providing medical care without discrimination. Reports highlight severe weight loss, skin diseases like scabies, and psychological trauma among detainees. Despite advocacy and public attention, few have been released. The ongoing detention of healthcare workers severely undermines Gaza’s healthcare capacity dur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eighty-palestinian-medical-workers-including-doctors-held-without-charge-in-israeli-prisons-amid-gaza-conflict</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eighty-palestinian-medical-workers-including-doctors-held-without-charge-in-israeli-prisons-amid-gaza-conflict</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[European Space Agency Receives Historic Funding Boost for Space Defense Programs]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Space Agency (ESA) has secured a landmark budget increase for its space defense initiatives, receiving €22.1 billion from its member states for its 2026-2028 program. This marks the first time in ESA’s 50-year history that the agency has received more than it initially requested. ESA will continue its work on satellite technologies, including the Ariane 6 launch vehicle and the development of a new optical military intelligence network. The new funding will also support the modernization of Kourou’s spaceport in French Guiana and the deployment of low-orbit telecommunications satellites. The European nations contributing the most to ESA’s budget are Germany, France, and Italy, with Spain increasing its share significantly. Notably, Canada has also raised its contribution by 400%. Despite these large contributions, the specifics of the European strategy remain undefined, with member states still unsure of how the funds will be allocated.

The spacecraft docked at the Rassvet module just three hours later using a fast two-orbit approach. This marked the 11th Soyuz launch of 2025 and the 74th Soyuz flight to the ISS. Notably, the rocket featured artwork from children with cancer from 50 Russian cities and 14 countries. Following the launch, it was reported that the mobile platform 8U216 of the PU-6 pad, used for inspecting the rocket and installing ignition devices, detached and fell into the pad pit. This incident is unprecedented and significant because Baikonur's other Soyuz pad, PU-1, has been inactive since 2019, making PU-6 the only available pad for Soyuz crewed and Progress cargo missions.

It argues that despite three decades of climate conferences since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, global CO₂ emissions have continued to rise significantly—by about 65 percent. The text highlights the gap between political promises and real-world actions, noting that agreements such as the 1997 Kyoto Protocol failed to achieve their targeted reductions because commitments were rarely met or enforced. According to the article, global demand for fossil fuels continues to increase despite projections from institutions like the International Energy Agency that expected an imminent decline. Fossil fuels still supply the vast majority of the world's energy needs, around 87 percent, and renewable energy sources, although expanding, do not yet replace conventional energy but rather complement it.

Attacks on major ports and refineries, such as in Novorossiysk and Ryazan, severely disrupt oil flows. Sanctions by the US against major Russian companies like Lukoil and Rosneft have further complicated matters, leading to halted purchases from important buyers like China and India. The economic impact is evident, with oil-export revenues falling drastically, contributing to a major budget deficit of over $70 billion for Russia in 2025. The low crude prices, forced discounts, and extended tanker routes to markets increase the economic strain. Domestic borrowing to cover budget gaps is weakening the Russian economy, while the need to repair and defend oil infrastructure adds further financial burdens. This erosion in Russia’s oil income severely limits its financial capacity to sustain the war effort or pursue military actions in Europe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/deep-decline-in-russian-oil-revenues-amid-sanctions-and-ukrainian-attacks</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/deep-decline-in-russian-oil-revenues-amid-sanctions-and-ukrainian-attacks</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[DOGE staff fear prosecution after Musk's departure and lack of support]]></title><description><![CDATA[Employees and former staff of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are reportedly growing anxious about the possibility of criminal charges against them, following their work in reducing government programs and jobs. The concern stems from Elon Musk’s sudden departure from Washington, D.C., after an acrimonious split with Donald Trump, leaving the DOGE employees without the political protection they once had. The staff had relied on Musk as their protector, believing he could secure a presidential pardon if needed, especially after the Department's controversial actions. However, after Musk’s departure, they have become increasingly exposed to public scrutiny and potential investigations. Some DOGE workers have left, citing exhaustion and disillusionment over the loss of political support. This growing unease has led to internal discussions about the need for personal legal representation, as it seems Musk will no longer act as their advocate in case of legal troubles.

Lynch was interested in acquiring the NordStream pipeline, which had faced legal challenges after the operator's bankruptcy. By May 2025, a Swiss court approved the sale, and Pyrit Energy AG, led by Ralph Niemeyer, presented the highest bid for the acquisition. Despite the pipeline being out of service, interest in it has surged, with Pyrit seeking approval from the European Union to transport Russian gas, despite sanctions on such imports. The situation was further complicated when the German police issued arrest warrants for Ukrainian operatives linked to the sabotage of the pipeline. Former Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Chaputowicz suggested that improved U.S.-Russia relations could lead to the pipeline's reconstruction, with Europeans buying the gas. Stephen Lynch, a close ally of Donald Trump, has paid off the NordStream operators' debts and is now seeking to acquire it, with plans that might block Chinese access to]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-shows-interest-in-acquiring-nordstream-pipeline-amid-geopolitical-tensions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-shows-interest-in-acquiring-nordstream-pipeline-amid-geopolitical-tensions</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 13:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EDF Abandons Plan to Recycle Uranium Without Russian Assistance]]></title><description><![CDATA[French energy company EDF has abandoned its efforts to recycle spent nuclear fuel without relying on Russia. The project aimed to replace Russian imports by using a plant in the United Kingdom, owned by Westinghouse, to partially reprocess uranium from French nuclear reactors. However, the UK government reserved the facility for military use and imposed excessive financial requirements, making the project unviable. EDF also explored domestic alternatives with Orano, a major French nuclear company, but the Tricastin plant can only process natural uranium, and building a new facility would cost several billion euros without economic justification. As a result, EDF continues its partnership with Russian company Rosatom, whose facilities are currently the only ones in the world capable of converting reprocessed uranium for reuse in reactors. This contract, initially signed in 2018 and valid until 2031, supplies fuel to two reactors at the Cruas nuclear plant and remains unaffected by Europ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/edf-abandons-plan-to-recycle-uranium-without-russian-assistance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/edf-abandons-plan-to-recycle-uranium-without-russian-assistance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Court Reviews Appeal Against Government Ban on Palestine Action]]></title><description><![CDATA[A British court has begun examining an appeal against the Labour government's decision to designate the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The July designation led to more than 2,000 arrests of individuals who expressed support for the group, provoking strong criticism both domestically and internationally. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Council of Europe have described the measure as disproportionate, sparking debate in the United Kingdom about the balance between national security and the protection of fundamental rights. 

Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori is challenging the ruling, which places the group on the same level as organizations such as Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and the IRA. During the first day of the hearing, the defense argued that the ban contradicts the UK's longstanding tradition of defending civil disobedience within democratic frameworks.

Originally opened as Vernon Valley Summer Park in 1978, it expanded rapidly with attractions like alpine slides, water slides, go-karts, and wave pools. The park earned a reputation for reckless design and minimal safety oversight, with teenage staff and visitors frequently navigating hazardous conditions. Notable rides included the Cannonball Loop, a vertical loop waterslide that caused multiple injuries and was quickly closed, and the Tidal Wave Pool, where drownings and frequent rescues earned it the nickname 'The Grave Pool.' Other attractions such as the Alpine Slide, Roaring Rapids, and Tarzan Swing contributed to the park's perilous reputation, sometimes resulting in severe injuries or fatalities. Despite its dangers, Action Park became a cultural touchstone for the region, with visitors recalling the thrill and chaos as a formative childhood experience. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-history-and-legacy-of-action-park-america-s-infamous-amusement-park</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-history-and-legacy-of-action-park-america-s-infamous-amusement-park</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 07:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Italy Approves New Law Classifying Femicide as a Crime Punishable by Life Imprisonment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Italy's parliament has passed a significant new law that formally introduces femicide into the country's criminal code and establishes life imprisonment as its maximum penalty. The vote, which took place on the United Nations’ International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, received broad bipartisan support, with 237 lawmakers voting in favor. The legislation was championed by the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni and comes in response to a growing number of high-profile cases of lethal and non-lethal violence against women, which have sparked national debate about entrenched gender inequality and cultural attitudes in Italy.

The new law strengthens punitive measures for gender-based violence, expanding enforcement in cases of stalking, revenge pornography, and other offenses often preceding more severe aggression.

The launch, conducted via the Long March CZ-2F/Y Y22 rocket from Jiuquan Space Center, represents China's 75th orbital launch of 2025. Shenzhou 22 followed a fast two-orbit rendezvous profile, docking with the Tianhe module of the Chinese Space Station just under four hours after liftoff. The spacecraft carries 600 kg of supplies for the three astronauts aboard Shenzhou 21 and ensures a safe return vehicle in case of emergencies. The decision to launch Shenzhou 22 followed the discovery of triangular cracks in the outermost layer of Shenzhou 20's window during pre-return inspections. Simulations indicated a high risk that these cracks could expand during reentry, compromising the capsule's pressurization despite backup safety layers. The emergency mission, named TGYJ-1 (Tiangong Emergency 1), was prepare]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shenzhou-22-uncrewed-spacecraft-launched-to-replace-damaged-shenzhou-20</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shenzhou-22-uncrewed-spacecraft-launched-to-replace-damaged-shenzhou-20</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 20:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China Emerges as the Leading Global Creditor with Focus on High-Income Countries and Strategic Technologies]]></title><description><![CDATA[China has become the largest global creditor, with public banks issuing a total of $2.2 trillion in loans and grants worldwide since 2000, according to research by AidData. Contrary to common perceptions, most Chinese lending is directed toward high-income countries rather than developing nations. The United States has been the largest recipient, receiving over $200 billion, which has funded cash flow for major companies including Amazon, Tesla, Ford, Boeing, and Disney. Chinese loans also support critical infrastructure projects such as LNG facilities in Texas and Louisiana, data centers in Virginia, and major airports in Los Angeles and New York. European countries have also benefited, with Germany and the UK being major recipients.

They began a coordinated hunger strike on 2 November 2025 to protest their prolonged pre-trial detention and the UK government's handling of arms production linked to the conflict in Gaza. Four of them were involved in a 2024 break-in at an Elbit Systems factory in Filton, where they damaged property and spray-painted equipment as part of an anti-arms-trade protest. The two others were arrested during a 2025 action at RAF Brize Norton. None face terrorism charges, but the article argues that they are being held under counter-terrorism powers following the government’s proscription of Palestine Action.

Unlike hard drives that store data magnetically, SSDs store information by modifying electrical charges in NAND flash cells. This data can degrade over time if the drive is left unpowered. Consumer-grade SSDs, which typically use QLC or TLC NAND, can lose data after 1 to 3 years without power, while higher-end MLC and SLC NAND can last longer. Temperature, NAND quality, and voltage loss are factors that affect data retention. Despite this, most users do not need to worry, as primary SSDs in active use rarely sit unpowered for extended periods. However, for long-term storage or archival purposes, relying solely on SSDs is risky. Experts recommend maintaining backups using multiple storage methods, following the 3-2-1 rule: three copies of data on at least two different media, with one copy off-site.

Over the last 25 years, these banks have provided around $200 billion in loans to American businesses, many of which were kept secret by using shell companies based in offshore locations like the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and Delaware. A significant portion of this lending has been used by Chinese companies to acquire stakes in crucial US industries, especially those in national security and high-tech sectors, such as robotics, biotechnology, and semiconductors. This hidden financial network, which spans across many developed nations, including US allies like the UK and Germany, is part of China’s broader strategy to secure critical technologies.

The incident took place between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., with ground-based weapons used in an attempt to bring down the drones. However, the drones left the area and were not recovered. This event is one of several recent drone sightings near sensitive locations in the region, including the port area of Terneuzen, NATO command center in Brunssum, Maastricht Aachen Airport, and Schiphol. Similar drone incidents have also been reported in Germany and Belgium. Drone use is banned over airports and military bases in the Netherlands for security and flight safety reasons. The rising number of unexplained drone sightings has been described as worrying by the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, with investigations ongoing.

Israeli tanks entered the area, trapping dozens of families in Gaza's eastern neighborhoods, particularly around Al Shaaf, Al Nazzaz, and Bagdad streets. The military then installed concrete barriers, pushing the boundary further into Gaza. This action is seen as an expansion of Israeli-controlled territory, aligning with the Trump administration's ceasefire plan. Many families caught in the area remain unaccounted for, while heavy bombing struck the region during and after the shift. Local sources report that the situation is growing increasingly dangerous. The Palestinian government press office condemned this as a grave violation of the ceasefire, citing over 400 breaches since it began. These violations have led to over 300 Palestinian deaths and hundreds of injuries.

The plan emphasizes a central role for the United States, which would oversee the rebuilding process and benefit from a significant share of the profits. This includes the establishment of a dedicated investment fund financed by seized Russian assets, potentially amounting to 100 billion euros. The plan focuses on infrastructure, housing, and industrial recovery, with priority given to U.S. companies that could earn up to 50% of the profits. This approach seeks to build a lasting economic relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. beyond the current military aid. The plan also suggests major territorial concessions by Ukraine and promises that the country will not join NATO. These proposals, however, have generated controversy, as they were developed without consultation with Ukraine or the European Union, despite their direct involvem]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-peace-plan-for-ukraine-economic-strategy-and-u-s-dominance-in-reconstruction</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-peace-plan-for-ukraine-economic-strategy-and-u-s-dominance-in-reconstruction</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Plans to Deploy Non-Combat Troops in Ukraine Post-Conflict]]></title><description><![CDATA[The UK government has devised a plan to send non-combat troops to Ukraine after the conflict ends, according to British Defense Secretary John Healy, as reported by Bloomberg. These troops, stationed away from the frontlines, would serve a symbolic and logistical role in supporting Ukraine's military, focusing on training Ukrainian soldiers and conducting support operations like air patrols, maritime missions, and demining operations in the Black Sea. The mission’s initial cost is projected to exceed £100 million. However, recent developments suggest a shift in international dynamics. The United States has presented a peace agreement draft with Russia, which includes significant territorial concessions and restrictions on foreign military presence in Ukraine. This proposal, reportedly made without consulting European allies, also recognizes Russian sovereignty over Crimea and Donbas.

The tensions were exacerbated during her brief meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 31, at the APEC summit in South Korea. On November 7, an opposition lawmaker in Japan pressed Takaichi on what actions in the Taiwan Strait would justify military intervention by Japan. Her response signaled a stronger stance on security, particularly regarding a possible crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing swiftly responded on November 16, warning Japan of severe consequences if it intervenes militarily in the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese government outlined three key risks: heightened security hostility, the exposure of Japan to potential conflict, and a renewed international backlash against Japan’s militaristic comments, which could undermine post-World War II peace efforts.

This project, costing 12 million pesos, is part of the broader rehabilitation of the boulevard, which handles over 50,000 vehicles daily. The traffic lights adjust the green light duration based on traffic flow and communicate with each other to synchronize their cycles, promoting a 'green wave' that allows vehicles to pass through multiple intersections without stopping. The system is designed for speeds of up to 50 km/h and aims to improve travel times by 15-20%.

The plan includes a full and unconditional non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine, and Europe, along with NATO’s commitment not to expand further. Ukraine is to remain non-aligned with NATO, and its military will be capped at 600,000 personnel. In exchange, Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees. The plan also suggests economic incentives, including the establishment of a Ukrainian Development Fund, investments in high-growth industries, and the reconstruction of war-torn areas. Moreover, it proposes the gradual lifting of sanctions on Russia and invites the country to rejoin the global economy, including the G8. An international economic package will be established for Ukraine’s recovery, with substantial contributions from the U.S. and Europe.

Although ICE claims its operations target illegal immigrants with criminal histories, reports indicate that Native individuals, including members of the Navajo and Mescalero tribes, have been detained due to assumptions made about their ethnicity and appearance. Many ICE officers are reportedly unaware of the unique status of Native Americans as U.S. citizens. In response, Native tribes are urging the Trump Administration to direct ICE to accept Tribal IDs as proof of citizenship, especially for those who may lack other documentation such as birth certificates. Experts advise Native individuals to carry both their Tribal ID and state identification to avoid confusion.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, emphasized that any successful peace plan must be supported by both Ukraine and Europe, warning that rewarding aggression would lead to further Russian expansion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha criticized the proposal as an attempt to appease Russia, which he believes would only lead to more war. The timing of the proposal is also problematic, as Ukraine is dealing with internal corruption scandals and increased Russian military pressure.

The survey, titled 'Slums' in the MRU photo library, consisted of 106 6x6cm negatives. These images were taken in collaboration with Father Michel Quoist, a sociologist who had previously researched the same area for his doctoral thesis. The photographs depict the difficult conditions faced by the residents, highlighting the cramped and dilapidated housing, as well as everyday moments such as children playing and women washing clothes in communal spaces. The images offer a sobering glimpse into post-war French society, where many lived in poverty amidst the reconstruction period.

The goal is to reduce the time it takes for military personnel and equipment to cross borders, with a target of just three days in peacetime and six hours in emergencies. Currently, moving troops and equipment, such as from the western to the eastern EU, can take months due to inadequate infrastructure. Apostolos Tzitzikostas, EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport, has warned that Europe's roads, railways, and bridges are ill-prepared for large-scale military deployments in the event of a conflict, particularly with Russia.

The draft removes explicit requirements for data registration, but a loophole mandates service providers like email and messaging platforms to take 'appropriate risk mitigation measures,' which could include recording all private messages, even from encrypted services. This raises concerns about privacy, with critics fearing an increase in 'false positives' that could target innocent citizens.

Desde la llegada del primer iPhone en 2008, los precios de los smartphones de marcas líderes como Apple y Samsung han aumentado más rápido que los salarios, alcanzando en 2025 niveles que suponen entre el 57% y el 62% del salario mediano. Marcas chinas como Xiaomi han ofrecido alternativas más económicas, que apenas requieren entre el 12% y el 14% del sueldo mensual, acercando los smartphones de gama media a un público más amplio. La estrategia de las marcas de posicionarse en la gama alta y la inclusión de tecnologías avanzadas, junto con los costes de fabricación, I+D y logística, han contribuido al incremento de precios. La polarización del mercado se refleja en que los modelos más caros, como el Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design, alcanzan los 3.499 euros, mientras que otros como el Redmi Note 14 se mantienen accesibles.

La renuncia se produce tras una investigación de la Oficina Nacional Anticorrupción de Ucrania (NABU) que vincula a Yermak con una trama de sobornos en la empresa estatal de energía nuclear Energoatom, conocida como 'caso Midas'. Según la investigación, la red habría blanqueado al menos 100 millones de dólares mediante el cobro de comisiones ilegales a empresas contratistas, en connivencia con altos funcionarios, entre ellos los ministros de Energía y Justicia. El presunto cerebro de la operación sería el empresario Timur Mindich, antiguo socio de Zelenski, que ha huido del país. Las filtraciones apuntan a que Yermak, apodado 'Alí Babá' por los investigadores, habría recibido beneficios directos de la red.

Aunque Vilaplana aseguró en su declaración que no prestó atención a las llamadas y mensajes de Mazón, la magistrada considera “altamente improbable” que no escuchara parte de las conversaciones, dado el reducido tamaño del reservado del restaurante El Ventorro, de unos 16 metros cuadrados. La periodista ha cambiado varias veces la versión sobre sus movimientos esa tarde, incluyendo la hora de salida y un paseo hasta el aparcamiento junto a Mazón. La jueza también rechaza investigar a Vilaplana por falso testimonio, recordando que para ello es necesario contar con una verdad procesalmente establecida.

Microsoft ha reconocido públicamente que múltiples componentes esenciales, como el menú de inicio, la barra de tareas y el explorador de archivos, presentan fallos estructurales generalizados que afectan gravemente la experiencia del usuario. Estos problemas tienen su origen en la corrupción de los paquetes XAML, que coordinan la interfaz gráfica, y provocan bloqueos frecuentes de procesos críticos del sistema. Los fallos comenzaron a manifestarse tras las actualizaciones acumulativas de julio de 2025 y afectan a las versiones 24H2 y 25H2 de Windows 11, incluso en instalaciones nuevas, descartando problemas de configuraciones antiguas. Microsoft ofrece un parche temporal mediante un script de PowerShell, aunque esta solución resulta poco práctica para usuarios sin conocimientos técnicos.

Los actos vandálicos, registrados durante los últimos dos años, ascienden a un perjuicio económico de más de 550.000 euros. La policía catalana detuvo a once personas por 34 delitos que suman 99.043 euros en daños, mientras que la Policía Nacional arrestó a nueve más por 94 delitos con un coste de 455.660 euros. Los investigadores destacan además el impacto medioambiental de estos actos, dado que la limpieza de grafitis requiere productos químicos y lavados a presión que aumentan el consumo de agua y energía. Los grafiteros accedían a las estaciones por zonas no habilitadas y cambiaban horarios y días para evitar ser capturados, firmando sus obras con seudónimos o “tags”.

La obra combina rigor histórico con narrativa ágil, explorando la evasión de capitales, la actuación de la policía y los jueces, y las repercusiones internacionales del caso, incluyendo España, Suiza y Estados Unidos. Faes destaca la complejidad de los personajes y la interacción entre poder político y económico en los siglos XIX y XX, abordando dilemas morales y decisiones políticas cruciales en la época. El historiador subraya la importancia de investigar a fondo en archivos y fuentes, evitando simplificaciones y reduccionismos, y ofrece un relato que contextualiza la modernización de la policía franquista, la diplomacia suiza y los circuitos financieros internacionales.

'Usted ha dicho que Rusia debería pagar por la reconstrucción de Ucrania, ¿cree que Israel debería pagar por la reconstrucción de Gaza?', le preguntó Intxaurrondo. Kallas respondió invocando el derecho internacional: 'Quien causa los daños tiene que compensar esos daños'.

Junto a Fede Valverde, creó una sincronía que desmontó la teoría de que las estrellas complican la labor del entrenador, demostrando que el buen juego surge de planteamientos tácticos acertados y de mantener a los jugadores clave en el campo.

Más tarde, el bloque fue vendido a tres compañías con sede en Barcelona. En 2023, el Ayuntamiento de València, gobernado por PP y Vox, aprobó una licencia de cambio de uso del inmueble de residencial a hotelero, a pesar de que aún quedaban cuatro viviendas habitadas. Después de insistentes reclamaciones vecinales, la licencia hotelera caducó y fue anulada, aunque el consistorio otorgó una nueva para una reforma integral del edificio. Los residentes sospechan que esta remodelación busca, de facto, reactivar el plan turístico a medio plazo, ya que los apartamentos reformados podrían alquilarse por más ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vecinos-de-la-finca-groga-frenan-la-conversion-hotelera-y-defienden-su-derecho-a-permanecer-en-el-barrio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vecinos-de-la-finca-groga-frenan-la-conversion-hotelera-y-defienden-su-derecho-a-permanecer-en-el-barrio</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 17:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Albacete declara a Pedro Sánchez persona non grata con apoyo de PP y Vox]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Albacete aprobó el jueves pasado una moción que declara al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, persona non grata en la ciudad y le pide la dimisión. La iniciativa la presentó el concejal no adscrito José Ramón Conesa, expulsado de Vox en 2024 por abstenerse en la votación de los presupuestos municipales. Conesa justificó su propuesta acusando a Sánchez de pactar con 'los asesinos y herederos de ETA', de inutilidad en la gestión de la pandemia y la DANA, y de corrupción crónica. Durante su intervención en el pleno, lució una insignia con la bandera franquista en la solapa y gemelos con el yugo y las flechas de Falange Española, símbolos preconstitucionales que generaron polémica. La moción contó con los votos a favor del PP y Vox, pese a que Conesa ya no milita en este último partido.

En la Península y Baleares, predominó inicialmente un patrón de altas presiones que mantuvo condiciones estables hasta el jueves, seguido de un cambio hacia una depresión británica a final de semana. Esto dividió la semana en una fase seca inicial y otra más húmeda con tormentas significativas, destacando episodios intensos en Valladolid, Navarra y Cataluña. Las precipitaciones provocaron inundaciones, cortes de carreteras y evacuaciones, incluyendo un trágico accidente en la riera de Sant Quintí de Mediona (Barcelona). Las temperaturas máximas fueron superiores a lo habitual, con anomalías positivas especialmente en el sur y el este peninsular, y en Canarias donde se superaron los 40 °C en Gran Canaria.

Yermak ha declarado que está colaborando plenamente con las autoridades, aunque aún se desconoce si será formalmente investigado. El caso Midas se centra en grabaciones de Timur Mindich, socio de Zelenski en la productora Kvartal 95, que sugieren desvíos de fondos en varios ministerios, especialmente en Energía, con pérdidas estimadas en más de 85 millones de euros.

Con el apoyo a Nasry Asfura, candidato del Partido Nacional y vinculado a casos de narcotráfico, Trump busca influir en el resultado electoral de un país en el que su apuesta por Asfura ha sido criticada. Trump ya había usado una estrategia similar en Argentina al respaldar al conservador Javier Milei, pero en el caso de Honduras su apoyo se ha sumado a una campaña en la que el liberal Salvador Nasralla lideraba las encuestas. La intervención de Trump ha puesto en duda el apoyo de los votantes indecisos, mientras que Asfura ha agradecido públicamente la intervención de Washington. En el otro extremo, Rixi Moncada, la candidata oficialista, se ha distanciado de las acusaciones de ser comunista, una etiqueta que se le ha asignado por su cercanía a los gobiernos de izquierda latinoamericanos.

A los ocho años sufrió abusos sexuales por parte de un religioso marista mientras acudía a catequesis en el colegio La Inmaculada de Valladolid, en 1974. Según relata, el agresor empezó a acosarla desde el primer día y la culpabilizó de los hechos, provocándole una profunda vergüenza y miedo. Durante años vivió atrapada en el trauma, con episodios de amnesia, sentimientos de culpa y pensamientos suicidas en la adolescencia. No fue hasta los cuarenta cuando comprendió que no tenía ninguna responsabilidad en lo sucedido. Tras un largo proceso de terapia, Paula colabora hoy con la Asociación Nacional Infancia Robada (ANIR) para apoyar a otras víctimas.

Las indagaciones señalan como responsable de organizar estos llamados “safaris humanos” a Jovica Stanisic, entonces jefe de la Dirección de Seguridad del Estado de Serbia. Distintas fuentes judiciales y periodísticas revelan que Stanisic no solo era un alto cargo bajo el régimen de Slobodan Milosevic, sino también un agente de la CIA estadounidense, reclutado en 1991 por el agente William Lofgren. Según documentos clasificados presentados en su juicio, Stanisic colaboró con la inteligencia de Estados Unidos proporcionando información sobre el régimen serbio, localizando fosas comunes y ayudando en operaciones de liberación de rehenes de la OTAN. A pesar de ese vínculo, fue condenado en 2021 a 15 años de prisión por crímenes de guerra en Bosnia y Herzegovina.

En el norte, el gobierno islandés ha elevado el posible colapso de la Circulación de Retorno Meridional del Atlántico (AMOC) a la categoría de asunto de seguridad nacional. Esta corriente oceánica es clave en la regulación climática global, y su debilitamiento podría causar un enfriamiento severo en el norte de Europa mientras el resto del planeta continúa calentándose. Investigadores como Stefan Rahmstorf consideran el debilitamiento de la AMOC una evidencia irrefutable y advierten de que su colapso podría ocurrir en este siglo, generando episodios meteorológicos extremos sin precedentes en Europa.

La infraestructura de protección infantil en las islas está saturada, con cerca de 6,000 menores no acompañados alojados en centros. Investigaciones policiales recientes han llevado a la detención de once personas implicadas en estas redes, que utilizaban documentos falsificados y transporte no detectado para movilizar a las víctimas.

Se manifiesta en una disminución considerable en la atención, dificultad para realizar tareas complejas, pérdida de memoria a corto plazo y un pensamiento simplificado. Esta condición, alimentada por la adicción al uso constante de dispositivos móviles, afecta la salud mental y contribuye a la disminución de la capacidad crítica y al aumento del anti-intelectualismo. Además, el 'brain rot' sirve al capitalismo como una herramienta para alienar a la población, transformando a las personas en meros consumidores cuyo sentido de identidad se basa en lo que compran o consumen, reforzando así el vínculo entre identidad personal y consumo.

Según sus declaraciones a Newsweek, se prevé que los precios de las viviendas se reduzcan hasta en un 50 % en los próximos años, empezando a caer con fuerza el año que viene. Wright señala que esta tendencia se debe principalmente al aumento del inventario, la disminución de la demanda y el estancamiento de la accesibilidad, ya que los altos costes de las hipotecas, los impuestos y los seguros continúan excluyendo a millones de estadounidenses del mercado inmobiliario. 

Los datos recientes respaldan esta visión pesimista: más de la mitad de las viviendas del país perdieron valor durante el último año, el mayor descenso desde 2012. Aunque el crecimiento de precios se ha ralentizado, muchas propiedades siguen muy por encima de los niveles anteriores a la pandemia.

Además, los gastos anuales de mantenimiento, seguro y otros servicios específicos suman entre 1.500 y 2.500 euros. Comparando con diferentes opciones de vacaciones, se estima que con el precio de compra de una camper (40.000 euros) se podrían financiar 40 a 57 años de vacaciones mochileras en Europa, de 14 a 7 años en hoteles de lujo en Bali, y entre 32 y 14 años en alojamientos de Airbnb en España.

La historia se centra en los esfuerzos desesperados de los voluntarios de la Media Luna Roja, quienes intentaron salvar a Hind, mientras las autoridades israelíes bloqueaban el acceso de la ayuda. La directora evita mostrar violencia explícita, enfocándose en las voces y emociones de los involucrados. La película se ha convertido en un símbolo de denuncia y es un llamado a la justicia por los crímenes de guerra perpetrados durante la invasión. A través de este trabajo, Ben Hania busca incomodar al espectador, confrontándolo con la realidad del sufrimiento infantil en Gaza. El caso ha generado gran repercusión internacional, co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-conmovedora-pelicula-sobre-el-asesinato-de-hind-rajab-en-gaza-denuncia-la-tragedia-de-la-infancia-palestina</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-conmovedora-pelicula-sobre-el-asesinato-de-hind-rajab-en-gaza-denuncia-la-tragedia-de-la-infancia-palestina</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gemma Nierga reivindica la diversidad e inclusividad en los Premios Ondas 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[En la gala de Premios Ondas 2025, la periodista Gemma Nierga recibió el galardón al Mejor Programa de Proximidad por su espacio Café de Ideas (Ràdio 4). Durante su discurso de aceptación combinó saludo al equipo, agradecimientos y una reflexión cargada connotaciones sociales: bromeó sobre la reacción de sus hijos al premio y manifestó su orgullo por el trabajo del equipo. Dirigió unas palabras también hacia periodistas que atraviesan incertidumbres laborales, animándoles a persistir y recordándoles que este Ondas demuestra que “se puede volver a empezar”. Pero lo más significativo vino al final: en un alegato antirracista, Nierga expresó su deseo de que en el futuro los premiados tengan nombres como Salma, Usman o Mohamed, como símbolo de una sociedad más inclusiva y diversa, donde triunfen quienes muchos quieren expulsar. Esa declaración fue recibida con fuertes aplausos en el auditorio y marca un gesto claro de respaldo a la inmigración y la convivencia, además de un rechazo a discur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gemma-nierga-reivindica-la-diversidad-e-inclusividad-en-los-premios-ondas-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gemma-nierga-reivindica-la-diversidad-e-inclusividad-en-los-premios-ondas-2025</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un tribunal reconoce el derecho de familias musulmanas en Mallorca a que sus hijos reciban clases de religión islámica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Baleares (TSJB) ha reconocido el derecho de cinco madres musulmanas en Mallorca a que sus hijos puedan recibir clases de religión islámica en sus colegios, incluso en centros de ideario católico. La sentencia responde a la demanda de una madre de origen magrebí, llamada Yamira (nombre ficticio), que tras un año de silencio administrativo por parte de la Consejería de Educación decidió acudir a los tribunales. El TSJB considera que la negativa o falta de respuesta vulnera el artículo 27.3 de la Constitución Española, que garantiza a los padres el derecho a que sus hijos reciban formación religiosa y moral conforme a sus convicciones. Según J. Nur Bió, portavoz de la Asociación Musulmana de las Islas Baleares (AMMU), cada vez hay más familias en las islas que reclaman este tipo de docencia, amparadas por la legislación y por los acuerdos entre el Estado y la Comisión Islámica de España.

Aunque el dictador lideró una dictadura sangrienta que dejó miles de muertos, muchas personas, sobre todo jóvenes, tienen una visión distorsionada de su impacto positivo en la historia del país. La educación sobre la dictadura franquista ha sido deficiente, lo que contribuye a una falta de conciencia sobre los horrores de esa época. En la actualidad, muchos jóvenes piensan que Franco fue beneficioso para España, sin entender las consecuencias de su régimen autoritario, represivo y violento. El historiador Giles Tremlett alerta sobre esta tendencia y subraya la importancia de romper el silencio en torno a la dictadura y enseñar la verdadera historia a las nuevas generaciones. A pesar de los avances democráticos, aún existen narrativas que intentan justificar o incluso venerar a Franco, lo que subraya la necesidad de una educación más profunda sobre el franquismo y su legado de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vision-de-franco-en-espana-una-falta-de-conocimiento-historico-que-pone-en-riesgo-el-futuro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vision-de-franco-en-espana-una-falta-de-conocimiento-historico-que-pone-en-riesgo-el-futuro</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis del crecimiento del antifeminismo como expresión del malestar social]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo aborda el fenómeno del antifeminismo, situándolo dentro de una crisis estructural social que atraviesa la sociedad actual. Se explica que el antifeminismo opera como un canal de expresión para el malestar social, especialmente entre los jóvenes. Se examinan las causas que alimentan este sentimiento, vinculadas a la incertidumbre económica, las transformaciones sociales y la percepción de amenaza ante cambios en los roles y derechos de género. Además, se analiza cómo ciertos discursos y movimientos intentan manipular a la juventud para canalizar su frustración hacia posturas antifeministas, en lugar de buscar soluciones colectivas a los problemas sociales. La pieza plantea preguntas sobre cómo combatir este fenómeno e invita a reflexionar sobre estrategias para fortalecer una sociedad más justa y equitativa.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-del-crecimiento-del-antifeminismo-como-expresion-del-malestar-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-del-crecimiento-del-antifeminismo-como-expresion-del-malestar-social</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 10:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adolf Hitler Uunona, un político namibio, se acerca a ganar las elecciones regionales en Namibia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adolf Hitler Uunona, un político veterano de Namibia, está a punto de ganar unas elecciones regionales en el distrito de Ompundja, donde goza de gran popularidad. A pesar del peculiar nombre que comparte con el dictador nazi, Uunona insiste en que su nombre es una coincidencia histórica, ya que Namibia fue colonia alemana hasta 1915. Su padre lo eligió sin conocer el peso del homónimo europeo. Uunona, de 59 años, ha sido un activista destacado en la lucha anti-apartheid y por la independencia de Namibia. En su carrera política se ha centrado en el desarrollo local, infraestructuras y programas comunitarios. En las últimas elecciones de 2020, obtuvo una victoria arrolladora con un 85% de los votos, y su partido espera una nueva victoria, aunque con un apoyo algo menor. A pesar de los logros políticos de Uunona, el foco de atención sigue siendo su nombre, algo que le resulta incómodo, ya que considera que se habla más de ello que de las verdaderas necesidades de su comunidad.

Esta nueva norma, que también afecta a los ciclomotores y motocicletas, busca mejorar la movilidad y evitar vehículos abandonados o sin seguro. La concejala de Vías Públicas, Blanca Hernández, ha señalado que la medida tiene como objetivo garantizar una ciudad más ordenada y eficiente. Sin embargo, los grupos de oposición han mostrado su preocupación por la eficacia de los controles y la seguridad jurídica de las sanciones. Además, algunos han cuestionado la viabilidad de implementar la ordenanza sin la disponibilidad de aparcamientos disuasorios.

El vídeo parece ser una metáfora política, pero la reacción pública ha sido de puro desconcierto, ya que muchos lo consideran un intento de atraer atención sin una base seria. Este tipo de estrategias, que se asemejan a las utilizadas por otros líderes ultraderechistas, como Javier Milei en Argentina, parece estar siendo adoptado por Vox en un intento de amplificar su mensaje a través del humor y el espectáculo.

La UNRWA, que presta asistencia humanitaria a millones de refugiados palestinos, ha sido galardonada con el Premio infoLibre 2025 por su compromiso y resiliencia. Martí denuncia que Israel ha destruido casi todas las infraestructuras de la organización, asesinando a 382 empleados y a más de 800 personas refugiadas en instalaciones protegidas de la ONU, lo que vulnera el derecho internacional humanitario.

El tribunal también ha condenado a otros 13 directivos y a la propia empresa Hafesa, mientras que ha absuelto a ocho empleados. El caso gira en torno a una compleja organización que defraudó 154 millones de euros mediante un sistema de evasión del IVA en operaciones comerciales con combustibles. La sentencia, de 450 páginas, considera probado que los acusados usaron empresas pantalla para eludir las obligaciones tributarias y aumentar su beneficio mediante la incorporación del IVA repercutido al patrimonio empresarial.

Esta visita se enmarca en la estrategia del Gobierno por acelerar la compra de trenes ante el aumento de la demanda de viajeros. Según el Ministerio, se trata de un proceso similar al de otras visitas a empresas europeas como Siemens o Hitachi. Sin embargo, la idea no está exenta de polémica.

La junta militar que gobierna desde los golpes de Estado de 2020 y 2021 no ha conseguido frenar el avance del Grupo de Apoyo al Islam y a los Musulmanes (JNIM), vinculado a Al Qaeda, que ha impuesto un bloqueo económico sobre la capital, Bamako. Este grupo ataca convoyes de combustible y paraliza el suministro energético, lo que ha provocado colas kilométricas, cierre de escuelas y escasez de alimentos y medicinas. La situación ha generado un clima de asfixia social y política que amenaza la estabilidad del país y de toda la región del Sahel.

El conflicto ha provocado un aumento del flujo migratorio hacia Europa, especialmente hacia las Islas Canarias, situadas a apenas 800 kilómetros.

El diputado de ERC irrumpe en el parlamento sin temor a señalar lo que otros prefieren ignorar. Su estilo directo y su capacidad para desmontar discursos contradictorios lo convierten en una figura singular dentro de la política española. Rufián no busca agradar, sino hablar con claridad sobre lo que realmente importa: la dignidad y los derechos de los ciudadanos. A menudo incomoda con su sinceridad, pero su actitud genuina resalta en un entorno político donde la retórica predomina.

Según el texto, Zelenski está aislado políticamente y obligado a aceptar el plan que implica el reconocimiento de Crimea y las repúblicas de Donbass como territorios rusos, así como la reducción del ejército ucraniano y la renuncia a misiles de largo alcance. Además, se destaca la corrupción endémica dentro del gobierno ucraniano y la desilusión de la población con Zelenski. Europa, especialmente la Unión Europea, se muestra hostil al plan de paz porque representa una capitulación, y podría enfrentar consecuencias políticas. El plan prevé también la desnazificación educativa del régimen ucraniano y un compromiso para la reconstrucción financiada entre Rusia y la UE.

Según la denuncia, Arrieta empleó un tono jocoso, pero los Comuns consideran que esta conducta evidencia que existía ya una mayoría formada y un cambio de ponencia, revelando así deliberaciones internas del tribunal.

Las áreas centrales y litorales, especialmente aquellas con sobreexplotación agrícola y fuerte desarrollo turístico, sufren un mayor deterioro. Entre los factores humanos que impulsan esta situación destacan el uso intensivo del agua, la acumulación de residuos agrícolas y una gestión hídrica inadecuada en algunas comarcas. Los expertos recomiendan medidas como la reutilización del agua, la desalinizacion, la recuperación de acuíferos y, en último caso, el trasvase de agua.

El estudio, publicado en la revista Science Advances, demuestra que un conjunto de conexiones que va desde el núcleo accumbens hasta el hipotálamo, y de éste a la habénula lateral, puede provocar que los ratones realicen acciones repetitivas como cavar o olfatear incluso cuando disponen de comida u otras recompensas. El núcleo accumbens forma parte del sistema de recompensa, mientras que la habénula lateral procesa experiencias negativas, lo que sugiere que la interacción entre ambas zonas puede alterar el equilibrio entre motivación y comportamiento repetitivo.

Su llegada coincidió con un contexto político y social complejo en Argentina, marcado por elecciones legislativas, el auge de La Libertad Avanza y la crisis económica. Durante los recitales, el público porteño mezcló entusiasmo, banderas y mensajes de protesta con su repertorio, que incluyó tanto clásicos de la Nueva Trova como canciones recientes de su álbum 'Quería saber' (2024). Silvio homenajeó a figuras políticas y culturales, desde Pepe Mujica hasta Mercedes Sosa, y abordó temas de actualidad en Cuba y América Latina, como la represión a jóvenes artistas cubanos y la lucha por los derechos humanos. La periodista Daniella Fernández, presente en los conciertos, destaca que Silvio sigue siendo un símbolo de esperanza y reflexión, capaz de conectar con varias generaciones a través de sus letras poéticas y críticas.

Este centro educativo fue uno de los afectados por la DANA de 2024, que dañó gravemente su sistema de climatización. La Conselleria de Educación instaló posteriormente una caldera provisional, pero no puede ponerse en marcha debido a fugas de gas detectadas durante las revisiones. Mientras tanto, ni siquiera se pueden usar calefactores eléctricos en las aulas porque la instalación no soporta la carga.

El AMPA del colegio ha denunciado esta situación y otras muchas deficiencias que persisten desde la riada, como la falta de puerta en el aula de dos años, el ascensor averiado, goteras mal reparadas y deficiencias estructurales que comprometen la seguridad. Las familias aseguran sentirse abandonadas por la administración y reclaman soluciones urgentes antes de que el frío s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-colegio-vil-la-romana-de-catarroja-sigue-sin-calefaccion-un-ano-despues-de-la-dana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-colegio-vil-la-romana-de-catarroja-sigue-sin-calefaccion-un-ano-despues-de-la-dana</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 21:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pradas declara que Mazón no mostró preocupación tras ser avisado del riesgo en Utiel durante la DANA]]></title><description><![CDATA[La exconsellera de Interior de la Generalitat Valenciana, Salomé Pradas, afirma en una entrevista emitida en el programa Salvados que, cuando alertó al entonces president en funciones, Carlos Mazón, sobre los graves problemas de acceso a Utiel y Requena el día de la DANA —en un momento en que ya se barajaba el posible desembalse del embalse de Forata— no percibió que él se mostrara preocupado. Según Pradas, Mazón se limitó a pedir que le mantuviera informado y no reveló dónde se encontraba, aunque se sabe que pasó buena parte del día en una comida con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana. La entrevista, la primera desde la tragedia, aportará lo que la exconsellera define como “detalles exclusivos” sobre la gestión de la emergencia que acabó con 229 muertos.

La Junta de Andalucía, tras ceses y dimisiones de altos cargos, anunció un plan de choque que prometía la contratación de 119 nuevos profesionales, incluidos 65 radiólogos y 18 técnicos especialistas, así como la creación de una Unidad de Cáncer de Mama en el Hospital Virgen del Rocío de Sevilla. Sin embargo, a día de hoy, apenas se ha incorporado un radiólogo nuevo y otro a tiempo parcial, y la unidad prometida aún no se ha implementado. Para cumplir con las pruebas pendientes, el hospital ha tenido que recurrir a horas extra del personal ya existente.

Los soldados relatan que se les ordenó ignorar el derecho internacional y emplear civiles, incluidos niños, como escudos humanos mediante un procedimiento denominado 'Protocolo Mosquito'. Este método consistía en forzar a palestinos detenidos a entrar en zonas potencialmente peligrosas, como túneles o edificios con riesgo de explosión, para proteger a las tropas israelíes. Algunos soldados, como Eli y Daniel, detallaron cómo las órdenes se daban al margen de reglas formales de enfrentamiento, basándose en la interpretación de los comandantes de cada situación.

El cadáver presentaba un tatuaje de una rosa de los vientos y la letra J, además de una postal dirigida a 'José Antonio', pero la investigación fue tan deficiente que el caso quedó sin resolver durante 37 años. La madre del joven, Josefa, acudió durante años a comisarías y medios de comunicación, sin obtener respuestas. En 2024, un nuevo equipo de la Policía Nacional revisó el expediente y logró identificarlo mediante un cotejo dactiloscópico con la huella original de su DNI conservada en Madrid.

La denuncia, presentada por una autodenominada 'Comisión Sanitaria contra el Antisemitismo', era anónima y fue difundida por el medio Enfoque Judío antes de su verificación formal, lo que generó preocupación por la falta de garantías y la divulgación mediática previa a la notificación al profesional.

Según el barómetro de la Asociación de Usuarios Financieros (Asufin), casi el 48% de los préstamos se destinan a comprar una segunda residencia con fines de inversión, mientras que solo el 15,9% corresponde a la compra de la primera vivienda. Este fenómeno refleja el peso del mercado inmobiliario como refugio de valor y como vía para obtener rentabilidad mediante el alquiler o la reventa. El estudio también muestra que, aunque la proporción de hipotecas para invertir ha caído desde el 56,2% al 47,7% entre febrero y noviembre de 2025, sigue liderando ampliamente las motivaciones para endeudarse. La subida de los tipos de interés, que llegaron al 4,5% en 2023, y la inflación elevada han modificado el comportamiento de los compradores, impulsando el interés por hipotecas a tipo fijo, que ahora promedian un 2,87%, frente a las mixt]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-48-de-las-hipotecas-en-espana-se-destinan-a-inversion-inmobiliaria-segun-asufin</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-48-de-las-hipotecas-en-espana-se-destinan-a-inversion-inmobiliaria-segun-asufin</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pulpo y gallano muestran una colaboración inusual en los fondos de las islas Cíes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un documental submarino ha captado una escena inédita en los fondos marinos de las islas Cíes, donde un pulpo común (Octopus vulgaris) y un pez gallano (Labrus mixtus) interactúan con sorprendente cooperación para buscar alimento.

El Tesoro británico estima que, sin reformas, los ingresos por impuestos sobre combustibles podrían reducirse entre 10.000 y 12.000 millones de libras al año, generando un desajuste fiscal considerable. Bajo el nuevo sistema, los conductores declararían anualmente su kilometraje y se ajustarían los pagos según las lecturas de la ITV.

Su municipio, cerca de Benidorm, ha experimentado un fuerte crecimiento poblacional, pasando de 7.000 a casi 10.000 habitantes en una década, con un promedio de 300 licencias de obra anuales. Predominan urbanizaciones de chalets de lujo con piscina, con precios desde 300.000 hasta un millón de euros. Sin embargo, existen unas 200 viviendas diseminadas en partidas rurales sobre parcelas de 2.000 a 10.000 m², muchas originadas como casetas de campo en los años 80 y convertidas ilegalmente en residencias en suelo no urbanizable. Pérez Llorca reside en una de estas construcciones irregulares de 800 m² en la falda del Puig Campana, con piscina ampliada en 2016 y cenador de 2006, propiedad de su familia, que expertos consideran fuera de ordenación pese a sus argumentos sobre una ley anterior y cal]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/modelo-urbanistico-en-finestrat-bajo-el-gobierno-de-perez-llorca-candidato-del-pp-a-la-generalitat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/modelo-urbanistico-en-finestrat-bajo-el-gobierno-de-perez-llorca-candidato-del-pp-a-la-generalitat</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 17:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Daft Punk: la historia del dúo que transformó la música electrónica y decidió volver a ser humano]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia repasa la trayectoria artística y humana del dúo francés Daft Punk, formado por Thomas Bangalter y Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, a raíz del lanzamiento del libro ilustrado 'Daft Punk: We Were The Robots'. La obra profundiza en los orígenes del grupo, desde su primer proyecto indie, Darlin’, hasta la creación de su identidad robótica y el impacto global de discos como 'Homework', 'Discovery' o 'Random Access Memories'. El texto rescata episodios clave como la invención de sus cascos diseñados por Tony Gardner, su histórica actuación en Coachella y la revolución estética y sonora que supusieron para la música electrónica contemporánea. También destaca cómo su separación en 2021 fue escenificada con el vídeo 'Epílogo', y cómo sus integrantes han tomado caminos distintos: Bangalter centrado en la composición orquestal y Guy-Manuel en colaboraciones puntuales, como la coautoría del tema ‘Reliquia’ para Rosalía.

Aunque mantiene la disciplina fiscal para no aumentar la deuda pública, el Gobierno no consigue apagar la crisis política ni reforzar el liderazgo del primer ministro. El plan fiscal, que grava principalmente a rentas medias y altas, busca enviar un mensaje de responsabilidad a inversores y Bruselas, pero la percepción pública es negativa, con servicios públicos colapsados y dificultades diarias para la ciudadanía. Las medidas sociales anunciadas son insuficientes para cambiar la experiencia de la población, y la falta de una visión clara de crecimiento económico aumenta la inestabilidad política.

El sitio recopila hoteles que responden afirmativamente a dos preguntas clave: ¿las puertas del baño cierran del todo? ¿Son de cristal? Solo los que confirman puertas sólidas y funcionales aparecen listados, ordenados por precio y ciudad, para que cualquiera pueda reservar con garantía de dignidad intacta. Ha contactado con cientos de hoteles y anima a los usuarios a denunciar los peores casos por email a bringbackdoors@gmail.com o por DM en Instagram con fotos, con el objetivo de avergonzar públicamente a esos establecimientos que priorizan la estética y el ahorro en materiales sobre la intimidad básica.

Este primer ejemplar no está destinado al vuelo, sino a realizar pruebas de validación críticas. La primera etapa del QM1 se utilizará en un ensayo WDR (Wet Dress Rehearsal), cargando queroseno y oxígeno líquido para comprobar la resistencia de los tanques y la estructura ante el peso de los propelentes. Por su parte, la segunda etapa se enviará a Estados Unidos para probar el sistema de terminación de vuelo (FTS), que asegura la destrucción controlada del cohete si se desvía de su trayectoria. PLD Space planea fabricar otro modelo de calificación y finalmente el modelo de vuelo que se lanzará desde la rampa ELM-Diamant del Centro Espacial de la Guayana Francesa.

El incidente tuvo lugar el pasado sábado por la tarde, cuando la mujer ingresó en el hospital Reina Sofía con heridas de arma blanca en el abdomen, lo que inicialmente activó el protocolo de violencia de género. Un día antes, la víctima había denunciado a su expareja, motivo por el cual se dictó una orden de alejamiento y el hombre fue posteriormente detenido en Jaén. 

Sin embargo, durante el transcurso de la investigación, la denunciante cambió su versión y admitió que las heridas habían sido autoinfligidas. Tras esta declaración, el detenido quedó en libertad y el juzgado procedió al archivo del caso. La información ha sido adelantada por el diario ABC y confirmada por Radio Córdoba.

Este dato supone el mínimo de la temporada y del año, lo que llama la atención si se considera que Antena 3 mantiene su liderazgo general en audiencias. El espacio confirma así su desgaste frente a la competencia, tras registrar en los últimos meses valores estables entre el 10% y el 11%, lejos del 13,3% que consiguió de media en la campaña 2024/2025. Frente a este retroceso, su competidor directo, ‘El programa de Ana Rosa’, alcanzó un sólido 14,5%, aventajando a Griso en más de cinco puntos. Además, Televisión Española consolidó su dominio en la franja matinal: ‘La Hora de La 1’, con Silvia Intxaurrondo, logró un 19,2%, mientras que ‘Mañaneros 360’, con Javier Ruiz y Adela González, obtuvo un 17,4%.

Según datos de la red cartográfica brasileña MapBiomas, desde 1985 se han perdido más de 52 millones de hectáreas de selva, una superficie superior al territorio de España. Esta destrucción representa un descenso del 13% de la vegetación original en apenas cuatro décadas. La ganadería extensiva y la expansión de cultivos como la soja son las principales causas de esta deforestación acelerada. Los pastos destinados al ganado pasaron de 12,3 millones de hectáreas en 1985 a más de 56 millones en 2024, lo que supone un crecimiento del 355%. Además, la minería ilegal, especialmente del oro, agrava el problema al utilizar mercurio para separar el metal, contaminando el agua y afectando gravemente a la fauna, la flora y las comunidades indígenas locales.

Este incremento ha repercutido directamente en el chocolate que se vende en los supermercados, donde muchos productos presentan menor contenido de cacao y un aumento de azúcares y grasas más económicas, como el aceite de palma. La reduflación también se ha generalizado: se venden tabletas más pequeñas al mismo precio o incluso más caro. A pesar de que el cacao tiene reconocidos beneficios para la salud, como efecto cardioprotector, mejora cognitiva y antioxidante, el exceso de azúcar y las grasas trans presentes en muchos productos comerciales pueden contrarrestar estos beneficios. Productos populares como Kit-Kat, ColaCao, Nocilla o bombones comerciales contienen cantidades elevadas de azúcar y grasas no saludables, aunque mantengan cierta cantidad de cacao.

Los recursos destinados por Madrid se sitúan 10 puntos por debajo de la media nacional y hasta 42 puntos por debajo del País Vasco, que encabeza la inversión. Las autonomías forales, como País Vasco y Navarra, presentan un gasto superior debido a su financiación privilegiada. En Madrid, la combinación de una renta per cápita elevada, decisiones políticas orientadas a la reducción de impuestos y la preferencia de la población por servicios privados explica su menor gasto público.

Según el estudio, la edad media de emancipación se ha elevado hasta los 30,4 años, muy por encima de la media europea de 26,3, debido al elevado coste de la vivienda. Actualmente, el alquiler de un piso completo supone el 92% del salario de un joven, y apenas el 3,3% de las viviendas son de alquiler social. Como consecuencia, la propiedad entre menores de 35 años ha caído del 58% en 2017 al 27% en 2024, a pesar de que el 80% de estos jóvenes desearía poder adquirir una vivienda propia. Además, el aumento de la vivienda turística y la falta de regulación han reducido aún más la disponibilidad de pisos.

La tesis, defendida en la Universidad Complutense el 15 de octubre de 2024 —el mismo día en que el Supremo abrió causa contra García Ortiz—, se centró en la responsabilidad penal de las empresas. La relación académica entre Del Moral y Rodríguez-Ramos, según diversas fuentes, deriva de una conexión previa entre el magistrado y el padre del abogado, también jurista. Esta circunstancia no figura entre las causas de abstención previstas por la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial, que solo contempla casos como la amistad íntima o la enemistad manifiesta.

En una sesión reciente del Parlamento andaluz, varias mujeres de la Asociación Amama —que denuncia los fallos en el sistema de detección precoz del cáncer de mama— interpelaron al presidente Juanma Moreno Bonilla con gritos y lágrimas. Una de ellas, Anabel, relató su experiencia tras haber sufrido una mastectomía y reprochó entre sollozos al presidente que le había arruinado la vida, afirmando que lo había votado esperando una gestión responsable. El suceso fue captado por las cámaras instantes antes de que se interrumpiera la transmisión del pleno, reflejando la frustración y el dolor de las afectadas. La asociación Amama lleva meses denunciando deficiencias en el seguimiento de los hallazgos radiológicos clasificados como BI-RADS 3, lo que habría dejado sin supervisión a más de dos mil mujeres.

Trump reaccionó desde su red social Truth Social acusando al diario de publicar información falsa y de actuar movido por intereses políticos. En su mensaje, descalificó al periódico como «basura barata» y «enemigo del pueblo», expresiones que ha utilizado en repetidas ocasiones para desacreditar a medios críticos con su gestión. El presidente también dirigió ataques personales contra la periodista Katie Rogers, autora del artículo, a quien calificó de «reportera de tercera categoría» y «fea por dentro y por fuera».

Se explica que la crisis actual difiere de la de 2008 en que no se basa en una burbuja del crédito o la construcción, sino en un fenómeno alimentado por capital extranjero especulativo y la influencia de los trabajadores remotos con altos salarios. Además, se detalla el aumento del esfuerzo económico necesario para adquirir vivienda, el 'muro de entrada' financiero que obliga a muchas familias a permanecer en el alquiler, que es más caro y consume gran parte de sus ingresos, impidiendo el ahorro. El texto también analiza cómo el capital global y los inversores fijan los precios marginalmente, generando una burbuja estable y creciente, y expone el fenómeno de la gentrificación y desplazamiento de la población local en las grandes ciudades.

El alto tribunal considera que estas palabras se enmarcan dentro del derecho a la libertad de expresión y forman parte de la crítica política legítima, especialmente en el contexto de la confrontación ideológica entre partidos. Según la resolución de la Sala de lo Penal, las manifestaciones de Belarra constituían una opinión política fundada en su percepción y convicción sobre la actuación del Gobierno autonómico, por lo que no suponen un delito de calumnias con publicidad, como sostenía la presidenta madrileña en su querella.

Esta tipología de paneles, producidos por la empresa española Alucoil y comercializados como Larson PE, actúa como una 'gasolina sólida' en contacto con el fuego, acelerando su propagación mediante un efecto chimenea en las fachadas ventiladas.

La sentencia subraya que la práctica de VW vulnera la Ley 15/2022 de igualdad de trato y no discriminación. Durante el juicio, UGT, CCOO y el presidente del Comité de Empresa apoyaron a la dirección, defendiendo que la exclusión de incentivos no constituía discriminación y que reflejaba un equilibrio interno del convenio.

A través de datos históricos del Banco de España y la Sociedad de Tasación, el texto muestra que mientras en los años ochenta se necesitaban entre tres y cuatro años de salario bruto para comprar una vivienda, hoy hacen falta entre ocho y catorce, dependiendo de la zona. Madrid y Barcelona destacan como epicentros de esta nueva burbuja, impulsada no por el crédito o la construcción como en 2008, sino por la entrada masiva de capital especulativo y extranjero. 

El análisis destaca varios factores: el “muro de entrada” que obliga a disponer de grandes ahorros previos para poder hipotecarse, la inflación de bienes básicos que reduce la capacidad de ahorro, y la paradoja de que alquilar es más caro que pagar una hipoteca, pero resulta inalcanzable acceder a ella.

Blomerth destaca la importancia de la mediación experta en ciertos contextos culturales donde se emplean hongos con fines terapéuticos o rituales.

Con 63 años y más de 35 de carrera, Peramato fue fiscal de la Sala Jefa de la Sección Penal del Supremo y fiscal delegada para la protección de víctimas. Durante su etapa como fiscal de Sala Delegada de violencia sobre la Mujer, Peramato defendió que el silencio del acusado en casos de violencia de género pudiera ser considerado un indicio más de culpabilidad, una postura que ha generado polémica entre expertos legales por cuestionar principios básicos del derecho penal, como la presunción de inocencia. Su nombramiento, apoyado por el Gobierno y respaldado por operadores jurídicos, refleja continuidad con la línea de sus predecesores socialistas Dolores Delgado y Álvaro García Ortiz, pero también evidencia su perfil ideológico en cuestiones de género.

Entre las entidades que presentaron la queja se encuentran la Associació Catalana de Juristes Demòcrates, la Asociación de Abogados Demócratas por Europa y Xustiza e Sociedade de Galiza. Las asociaciones consideran que adelantar el fallo antes de la resolución escrita vulnera la tutela judicial efectiva y provoca un linchamiento mediático del condenado. El Supremo comunicó que García Ortiz fue condenado a dos años de inhabilitación y a pagar una multa de 7.200 euros, así como una indemnización de 10.000 euros a la pareja de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, aunque la sentencia completa explicando los motivos aún no ha sido redactada.

La medida se debe a que la organización no presentó a tiempo el justificante del pago de la fianza necesaria para ejercer como acusación popular. Manos Limpias, un colectivo de ideología ultraderechista, fue el impulsor de la denuncia inicial basada en recortes de prensa —algunos de ellos posteriormente desmentidos— que sirvieron como base para abrir la causa. 

La decisión judicial se tomó el pasado 24 de noviembre, coincidiendo con la renuncia del abogado del pseudosindicato, Carlos Perales. En su escrito de salida del caso, Perales señaló que el proceso había dejado de ser un asunto jurídico para convertirse en una herramienta con fines políticos. Añadió además que la abogacía no debía confundirse con el activismo político, y que las decisiones de la organización respondían principalmente]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juez-peinado-aparta-a-manos-limpias-del-caso-begona-gomez-por-no-pagar-la-fianza-exigida</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juez-peinado-aparta-a-manos-limpias-del-caso-begona-gomez-por-no-pagar-la-fianza-exigida</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El IMV se otorgará automáticamente a quienes agoten el subsidio de desempleo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno ha puesto en marcha un nuevo procedimiento que permitirá que las personas desempleadas que agoten su prestación o subsidio por desempleo y no hayan encontrado un nuevo trabajo pasen a percibir el Ingreso Mínimo Vital (IMV) de manera automática. Esta medida, anunciada por el Ministerio de Seguridad Social, Inclusión y Migraciones, busca evitar interrupciones en los ingresos de los hogares más vulnerables y reducir la carga administrativa para los ciudadanos. Según los últimos datos del Instituto de la Seguridad Social, más de 773.000 hogares con 2,3 millones de personas ya reciben esta prestación, cuyo importe medio ronda los 487 euros mensuales. El cambio se enmarca en el Real Decreto-Ley 2/2024, que ha simplificado diversos requisitos para acceder al IMV, incluyendo la reducción de trabas relativas a las parejas de hecho y la eliminación de la necesidad de que todos los adultos de la unidad de convivencia firmen la solicitud.

ICE sostiene que Ventura no figura en su base de datos, y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional asegura que no registraron a nadie con ese nombre durante los arrestos en esas fechas.

Más del 25% de la población vive en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social, situando a España como el cuarto país con peores cifras en la UE, solo por delante de Bulgaria, Rumanía y Grecia. La pobreza infantil es aún más alarmante: más del 34% de los menores están en riesgo, superando a países con ingresos similares como Eslovenia, donde solo un 10% de los niños se encuentra en esta situación. Además, la pobreza estructural persiste durante décadas, afectando a entre 6 y 7 millones de personas, lo que dificulta la movilidad social. El empleo tampoco garantiza seguridad económica: el 11,2% de los trabajadores españoles es pobre, una de las cifras más altas de Europa occidental.

Según el Ministerio Fiscal, la forense realizó juicios de valor improcedentes y culpabilizó a las víctimas durante las exploraciones médicas, lo que llevó a algunas de ellas a desistir de sus denuncias. Los hechos investigados se centran en tres episodios ocurridos entre 2019 y 2022 en hospitales sevillanos. En uno de ellos, una joven de 25 años recibió comentarios insinuando que era responsable de su agresión por haber salido de madrugada, lo que la llevó a no denunciar. En otro caso, una mujer hallada semiconsciente fue increpada por su supuesta embriaguez y tampoco se extrajeron muestras biológicas, mientras que una tercera víctima fue interrogada en tono acusatorio, sugiriendo que su relato podía no ser veraz.

Ordóñez reprocha a Ayuso que intente dividir a las víctimas en bandos y defendió que tanto las víctimas de la memoria histórica como las de ETA merecen igual derecho a la reparación. Además, acusó a Ayuso de insistir en hablar de ETA en 2025, cuando la banda se disolvió hace años. También denunció el uso electoral que el Partido Popular hace de las víctimas de ETA, calificando ese trato como una falta de respeto y un ataque a la dignidad de las víctimas.

Estos mensajes, encontrados en un grupo de WhatsApp llamado 'Naranjito', datan entre 2017 y 2020 y reflejan una comunicación cifrada entre García y sus exvicepresidentes Fernando Giménez y Óscar Liria.

El procedimiento se inició después de que una persona llamara desde Madrid para denunciar la existencia de un vídeo difundido por el propio hostelero en redes sociales, donde se veía una discusión en la terraza del establecimiento. La Policía Nacional remitió el vídeo al juzgado, lo que dio lugar a la apertura de diligencias, pese a no haber denuncia directa de los supuestos perjudicados, dado que los delitos de odio son perseguibles de oficio.

El magistrado reconoció que resulta “feo oírlo en boca de un juez”, pero insistió en que en la realidad jurídica española este precepto se vulnera de manera constante sin consecuencias.

Este hecho coincide con la presencia de Vilaplana y el president Carlos Mazón en Valencia, quienes, según testimonios, habían abandonado el restaurante El Ventorro y se encontraban en la plaza de Tetuán. La publicación confirma que este momento forma parte de un periodo de 37 minutos de desconexión del president entre las 18:57 y las 19:34 horas. Además, se constata que Mazón no atendió una llamada de la exconsellera Salomé Pradas destinada a informarle sobre el envío del Es Alert.

El vuelo tenía como destino Dublín y el incidente se produjo justo cuando la aeronave se preparaba para entrar en la pista de despegue, lo que obligó a cancelar la maniobra. Las causas del altercado aún no se han esclarecido. Según la Asociación Unificada de la Guardia Civil (AUGC), los agentes intervinieron tras un episodio de descontrol de la pasajera, que opuso una fuerte resistencia durante la detención, lo que derivó en lesiones para los efectivos.

El portavoz de la Oficina de Asuntos de Taiwán, Peng Qing'en, calificó la medida japonesa de 'provocación extremadamente peligrosa' y acusó a Japón de alimentar la confrontación militar en una zona especialmente sensible del Pacífico. Según Pekín, el despliegue viola el espíritu pacifista de la Constitución japonesa y representa una preocupante expansión militar impulsada por fuerzas derechistas. Los comentarios se producen tras las declaraciones de la primera ministra japonesa, Sanae Takaichi, quien sugirió que un ataque chino a Taiwán podría justificar la intervención militar de Japón, lo que ha desatado una nueva oleada de tensión diplomática entre ambos países.

La cifra supera en unos 31.000 fallecidos los datos oficiales proporcionados por las autoridades gazatíes, que sitúan el número de víctimas en torno a 69.000. El estudio, en el que también participó el Centro de Estudios Demográficos de Barcelona, se basó en fuentes del Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, la ONG israelí B'Tselem, la ONU y organismos de estadística palestinos.

Fundado por Eugene Mulvihill, comenzó en 1976 con un tobogán alpino y se expandió rápidamente, incorporando nuevas atracciones acuáticas y de motor, como el Waterworld y Motorworld. El parque se hizo famoso por sus atracciones peligrosas, entre ellas el Cannonball Loop, un tobogán cerrado con un bucle vertical, y la piscina de olas Tidal Wave, donde ocurrieron múltiples ahogamientos. Otras atracciones como Alpine Slide, Roaring Rapids y Tarzan Swing también estuvieron marcadas por numerosos accidentes y lesiones graves. La combinación de diseño poco seguro, mantenimiento irregular y personal juvenil contribuyó a su reputación de parque «sin ley».

Aunque las autoridades madrileñas, encabezadas por Isabel Díaz Ayuso y José Luis Martínez-Almeida, han negado problemas en el calendario, diferentes filtraciones procedentes de Liberty Media indican que la organización tiene serias dudas sobre que el proyecto pueda completarse a tiempo. Medios internacionales, como RMC Motori, han publicado descripciones del estado actual de las obras que muestran maquinaria parada, áreas sin avances recientes y zonas claves —como la destinada al edificio de boxes— en condiciones muy precarias. Estas informaciones apuntan a Imola como el circuito mejor posicionado para sustituir a Madrid en caso de que no se llegue a tiempo.

Aunque se ha difundido la idea de que los jóvenes prefieren estilos de vida más flexibles antes que comprar una casa, los expertos coinciden en que el verdadero obstáculo es económico. Según la Red para el Rescate de la Vivienda (REVIVE), desde 2005 el precio de la vivienda ha aumentado nueve veces más rápido que el salario promedio, lo que ha convertido el acceso a una vivienda en un lujo inalcanzable. Entre los factores que agravan la situación están la limitada oferta de nuevas viviendas, los procesos burocráticos que frenan la construcción y los salarios insuficientes. Muchos jóvenes destinan hasta el 40% de sus ingresos al alquiler, lo que hace casi imposible ahorrar para un enganche o acceder a un crédito hipotecario. Esta brecha económica ha provocado consecuencias sociales graves, como el aumento de los fraudes inmobiliarios y la proliferación de asentami]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-precio-de-la-vivienda-en-mexico-crece-mucho-mas-rapido-que-los-salarios-y-deja-fuera-a-los-jovenes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-precio-de-la-vivienda-en-mexico-crece-mucho-mas-rapido-que-los-salarios-y-deja-fuera-a-los-jovenes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más Madrid pide explicaciones a Idealista y Fotocasa por el impacto de sus algoritmos en los precios de la vivienda]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las diputadas de Más Madrid, Tesh Sidi y Alda Recas, han solicitado la comparecencia en el Congreso de los Diputados de representantes de los portales inmobiliarios Idealista y Fotocasa para aclarar cómo funcionan y qué efectos tienen sus algoritmos en el mercado de la vivienda.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el gobierno de Giorgia Meloni, busca dar respuesta al aumento de asesinatos y agresiones contra mujeres en el país, así como reforzar las herramientas institucionales para combatir la violencia de género.

La ley contempla medidas más estrictas para delitos relacionados, como el acoso y la difusión no consentida de imágenes íntimas (conocido como revenge porn).

Estos productos contienen compuestos que pueden acumularse en el suelo y los alimentos, con posibles efectos tóxicos a largo plazo, como daños al hígado y problemas reproductivos.

La protesta ha logrado que el gobierno declare la violencia de género como desastre nacional, lo que obliga a destinar más recursos y medidas específicas para su prevención. A pesar de los marcos legales existentes, las tasas de feminicidio permanecen elevadas, según la ONU y el Instituto de Criminología de la Universidad de Ciudad del Cabo.

En Novorossiysk, un ataque con misil Neptune dañó un puerto clave que maneja alrededor del 2% del flujo mundial de petróleo, mientras que la refinería de Ryazan fue atacada por quinta vez. Las operaciones diarias de drones ucranianos siguen golpeando refinerías y otros puntos estratégicos. Los envíos de petróleo ruso han descendido en 130.000 barriles diarios y el 35% de los petroleros cargados no tienen destino final, dejando unos 350 millones de barriles retenidos en el mar.

Estas cuentas, algunas con miles de seguidores, utilizaban tecnologías como la inteligencia artificial para amplificar mensajes de odio, racismo y antisemitismo, muchas veces con fines económicos o de manipulación política. La plataforma ha sido criticada por su escasa moderación y por permitir que las cuentas verificadas se compren, dificultando diferenciar entre usuarios legítimos y perfiles manipuladores.

Lagarde destacó que el modelo de crecimiento europeo, basado en la globalización y las exportaciones, está desfasado y ya no ofrece los beneficios de antaño. Durante las dos últimas décadas, la UE experimentó una fuerte integración global, pero hoy esa apertura ha generado vulnerabilidades. Las exportaciones, que antes eran un motor de crecimiento, han dejado de ser una fuente fiable debido a factores como la guerra en Ucrania, los aranceles estadounidenses y la creciente competencia de China. La presidenta del BCE subrayó que, en lugar de seguir esperando a que otros resuelvan estos problemas, Europa debe centrarse en mejorar su mercado único, eliminando barreras internas y facilitando el comercio dentro de la UE.

Sin embargo, si los utilizamos para almacenamiento a largo plazo sin alimentación, pueden perder datos con el tiempo. La memoria NAND de los SSDs almacena información mediante cargas eléctricas, pero esta retención no es indefinida. Por ejemplo, los SSDs con QLC pueden conservar datos aproximadamente un año sin energía, los de TLC hasta 3 años, mientras que los MLC y SLC pueden llegar a 5 y 10 años respectivamente. La mayoría de los consumidores usan SSDs de QLC o TLC, por lo que dejar un disco sin uso más de un año implica un riesgo de pérdida de datos. Otros factores como la temperatura y la calidad de la memoria también aceleran esta degradación. Para la mayoría de los usuarios que usan SSDs como almacenamiento primario, esto no supone un problema, ya que los reemplazan antes de agotar su vida útil. No obstante, para almacenamiento a largo plazo, se recomie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ssds-sin-uso-prolongado-pueden-perder-datos-precauciones-y-alternativas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ssds-sin-uso-prolongado-pueden-perder-datos-precauciones-y-alternativas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 04:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bolsonaro comienza a cumplir su condena por intento de golpe de Estado]]></title><description><![CDATA[El expresidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro ha comenzado a cumplir una condena de 27 años y tres meses de prisión por su implicación en un intento de golpe de Estado destinado a impedir la investidura de su sucesor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, tras su derrota electoral en 2022. La Corte Suprema de Brasil dio por agotadas todas las vías de recurso y ordenó el ingreso inmediato del exmandatario en una sala de doce metros cuadrados ubicada en la sede de la Policía Federal en Brasilia, donde ya se encontraba desde el sábado tras haber dañado la tobillera electrónica que debía portar como medida cautelar.

Según sus testimonios, las agencias de empleo que facilitan su llegada les prometen salarios competitivos y condiciones estables, pero en la práctica muchos se encuentran con deducciones salariales inesperadas, viviendas precarias y un alto grado de dependencia respecto a la empresa que les contrata y les aloja. Esto genera un clima de inseguridad constante: perder el empleo puede significar también quedarse sin techo. 

El artículo recoge el caso de Luis Pereira, un joven gallego de 26 años que, tras cambiar de agencia atraído por un pequeño aumento salarial, comenzó a experimentar obstáculos administrativos y falta de transparencia.

Según Aznar, España no enfrenta un grave problema migratorio, ya que la principal inmigración proviene de países hispanoamericanos, cuyos ciudadanos, afirma, se integran fácilmente debido a la cercanía histórica, cultural, lingüística y religiosa. Afirma que esta comunidad inmigrante viene principalmente a trabajar y no presenta dificultades de integración. Sin embargo, Aznar distingue a la inmigración musulmana, a la que atribuye problemas de integración, argumentando que algunos inmigrantes musulmanes no buscan adaptarse a la sociedad española sino que desean que sus leyes sean reconocidas. Estas declaraciones han generado debate sobre la visión de la inmigración y la integración cultural en España, así como sobre los posibles matices y estereotipos que pueden derivarse de ellas.

La jueza considera que no hay pruebas de que Faya se apoderara ilícitamente de los documentos que posteriormente sirvieron para destapar la presunta trama de sobornos a funcionarios argelinos a cambio de contratos millonarios para la empresa vasca Elecnor. La sentencia recalca que entregar documentos a la Fiscalía Anticorrupción no constituye delito de revelación de secretos, y que los materiales estaban en poder de Faya por su propio trabajo en el despacho Voltar Lassen, dirigido junto a los dos exdiputados. La resolución contradice la versión de Gómez de la Serna, quien lo acusó de extorsión y de difundir información a terceros, acusaciones que tampoco se pudieron probar.

El hallazgo forma parte de un proyecto de conservación medioambiental desarrollado junto a la Fundación Endesa y el Cabildo de Tenerife, centrado en la restauración y protección de los cedrales del Teide. Este descubrimiento supera al hasta ahora récord del llamado Bárbol, otro ejemplar de la misma zona con 1.481 años.

El trabajo de campo ha sido liderado por la Escuela de Ingeniería de la Industria Forestal, Agronómica y de la Bioenergía (EiFAB), cuyos miembros, con la ayuda de escaladores especializados, accedieron a zonas casi inaccesibles del parque para recoger muestras de madera y datarlas mediante carbono 14. Gracias a estas técnicas, se han datado 25 ejemplares de cedros, de los cuales ocho resultaron ser milenarios y tres superan los 1.500 años. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-cedro-canario-de-1-544-anos-es-identificado-como-el-arbol-mas-antiguo-de-la-union-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-cedro-canario-de-1-544-anos-es-identificado-como-el-arbol-mas-antiguo-de-la-union-europea</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La UPC dice que no hay déficit estructural de vivienda en España y que construir más no garantiza bajar precios]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio reciente del Centro de Política de Suelo y Valoraciones de la Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) contradice la visión del Banco de España sobre la vivienda. Según este análisis, España no enfrenta un déficit estructural de viviendas, ya que entre 2011 y 2021 el parque de viviendas creció más que el número de hogares, acumulando un excedente de más de 8 millones de viviendas, con casi 4 millones vacías. El acceso a la vivienda es cada vez más difícil debido a los precios historicamente altos, con un aumento del 13,8% en venta y del 40% en alquiler en comparación con 2007. Sin embargo, el estudio advierte que construir más viviendas no necesariamente reduce los precios, a menos que se enfoquen en viviendas asequibles y sociales, que actualmente representan menos del 10% de las transacciones y se han reducido al 7,8% en 2024. Asimismo, identifica factores que tensan el mercado, como el crecimiento del alquiler turístico, la expansión del alojamiento vacacional y la poca]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-dice-que-no-hay-deficit-estructural-de-vivienda-en-espana-y-que-construir-mas-no-garantiza-bajar-precios</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-dice-que-no-hay-deficit-estructural-de-vivienda-en-espana-y-que-construir-mas-no-garantiza-bajar-precios</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reyes Maroto abandona el Pleno de Madrid tras un duro enfrentamiento con Almeida]]></title><description><![CDATA[En un tenso Pleno del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, la portavoz socialista Reyes Maroto abandonó el salón después de un intercambio de acusaciones con el alcalde, José Luis Martínez-Almeida.

Almeida acusó a Maroto de estar rodeada de 'corrupción esférica' y de haber mentido en una comisión de investigación, además de vincularla con casos relacionados con Víctor Aldama y supuestos viajes con empresarios como Globalia y personas próximas al PSOE. Maroto, visiblemente molesta, pidió al alcalde que dejara de usar el 'comodín de Bildu' y le instó a acudir a los tribunales si tenía pruebas de irregularidades. Tras soportar varios ataques, decidió salir del Pleno manifestando estar 'harta' de las acusaciones.

Este texto, junto a otros ensayos, se publican por primera vez en España en la obra 'Desde un bosque lejano' (Errata naturae, 2025). Kaczynski critica la Revolución Industrial, considerándola un desastre que aumentó la esperanza de vida pero provocó daños sociales, psicológicos y ecológicos. Denuncia una humanidad 'hipersocializada' y atrapada en 'actividades sustitutas' insatisfactorias, además de prever peligros como la ingeniería genética, la crisis ecológica y la ascensión de la inteligencia artificial.

El alto tribunal, con ponencia del magistrado Pablo Llarena, entiende que las palabras de Belarra forman parte de una crítica política amparada por la libertad de expresión, reforzada además por su condición de diputada.

La transición, concebida como un movimiento estratégico para modernizar la imagen de la compañía energética y alinearla con valores de sostenibilidad, ha generado una intensa oleada de críticas entre consumidores, analistas y expertos en marketing. La nueva marca ha perdido parte del reconocimiento que durante décadas tuvo Cepsa, lo que ha obligado a Moeve a incluir de forma destacada la coletilla “antes Cepsa” en sus estaciones de servicio, anuncios y soportes digitales, para evitar la confusión del público. Según los analistas, el error principal radica en la desconexión entre la nueva identidad y el imaginario asociado a la vieja marca, además de una transición demasiado rápida que no dio tiempo al cliente para adaptarse ni para asociar el nuevo nombre con la empresa original.

El autor, Alfredo Mourelos Muñiz, expone que las crisis son fenómenos capaces de alterar profundamente la estabilidad financiera, social y política de los países, afectando a millones de personas. Comienza definiendo qué es una crisis económica y destaca tres elementos comunes: el endeudamiento incontrolado, la formación de burbujas financieras y el pánico de los inversores ante la pérdida de confianza en los mercados.

Entre estas personas se encuentra un grupo especialmente vulnerable: los sin hogar, mayoritariamente hombres y un 30% menores de 30 años. Muchos de ellos trabajan en empleos precarios que no les permiten alquilar una vivienda. La realidad del sinhogarismo se concentra sobre todo en el distrito Centro, seguido por Arganzuela, Tetuán y Puente de Vallecas, lugares que ofrecen más seguridad y vigilancia. La falta de datos precisos complica conocer la verdadera magnitud del fenómeno, ya que desde la llegada del PP y Ciudadanos al Ayuntamiento se dejó de realizar el recuento anual. Según datos del INE, unas 4.500 personas utilizaron centros de alojamiento en 2024, pero las ONG estiman que la cifra real es mucho mayor.

Tras constatar que la empresa del aparcamiento había eliminado los registros de entradas y salidas por haber transcurrido más de un año, la magistrada optó por rastrear el pago del ticket. Para ello requirió a la periodista sus datos bancarios con el fin de identificar el cargo correspondiente entre el listado de pagos facilitado por la empresa. El análisis determinó que el único cobro de 15,10 euros asociado a su tarjeta corresponde a una salida del aparcamiento a las 19:47 horas.

Esto implica, según el testimonio del propietario de El Ventorro, que Vilaplana abandonó el aparcamiento casi una hora después de haber salido del restaurante junto al president Carlos Mazón, quien según ese testimonio se marchó entre las 18:30 y las 19:00. La periodista, por su parte, había]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-jueza-de-la-dana-verifica-el-horario-de-salida-del-aparcamiento-de-maribel-vilaplana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-jueza-de-la-dana-verifica-el-horario-de-salida-del-aparcamiento-de-maribel-vilaplana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El relanzamiento de Digg: nueva etapa con IA y acceso anticipado bajo sospecha]]></title><description><![CDATA[Digg, una plataforma que fue pionera en la agregación de contenidos en internet durante mediados de los 2000, intenta resurgir en 2025 bajo la dirección de sus fundadores originales Kevin Rose y Alexis Ohanian. Esta nueva versión apuesta por una mezcla de nostalgia y tecnología moderna, destacando especialmente el uso de inteligencia artificial para moderar contenido y personalizar la experiencia. Además, han implementado un programa llamado Groundbreakers que permite a los usuarios asegurar su nombre de usuario previo pago de 5 dólares, buscando evitar el acaparamiento de nombres por bots y financiando causas benéficas con estos fondos. Sin embargo, esta estrategia ha generado dudas y críticas, ya que algunos consideran que la plataforma debería poder resolver esos problemas desde su diseño sin cobrar a los usuarios.

Durante su declaración, Olivera ha responsabilizado a dos subordinados —un comisario principal y un inspector jefe— de la investigación que vinculaba a Urbán con la supuesta venta de 40 kilos de cocaína en un pub de Malasaña. La Fiscalía Antidroga abrió entonces una investigación basada en un informe de fuente anónima, que finalmente se utilizó como pretexto para acceder a información financiera y política de miembros de Podemos, incluida la figura de Pablo Iglesias.

En aquella ocasión, Ruiz afirmó que Pérez pidió en redes sociales violar en masa a la hija del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, mientras sonaba el himno nacional. Según el texto judicial al que ha tenido acceso 'The Objective', el dirigente de Se Acabó la Fiesta sostiene que esta afirmación constituye una imputación falsa y gravemente lesiva para su reputación. 

La demanda reclama una indemnización de 65.000 euros por daños morales, argumentando que el programa se emitió en horario de máxima audiencia en una cadena pública y con alcance estatal, provocando un perjuicio inmediato y de gran repercusión. Pérez también indica que el daño se amplificó cuando el fragmento fue difundido masivamente en redes sociales.

Los secuestradores utilizaron motocicletas para controlar a los niños, muchos de los cuales fueron golpeados al intentar escapar. La policía local afirmó que solo había constancia de unos pocos desaparecidos, mientras que el gobernador del estado cuestionó el número de secuestrados y responsabilizó a la escuela por permanecer abierta pese a las amenazas previas. La situación ha generado frustración y desolación entre los padres, que denuncian sentirse abandonados por el gobierno.

La transición de marca, pensada para modernizar la imagen de la empresa energética, ha provocado confusión entre los consumidores y críticas en redes sociales y foros especializados. Debido a la pérdida de reconocimiento inmediato de la marca histórica Cepsa, la empresa se ha visto obligada a añadir la coletilla “antes Cepsa” en carteles, estaciones de servicio, anuncios y comunicaciones internas. Expertos en marketing consideran que este rebranding es un ejemplo de cómo no gestionar un cambio de identidad corporativa, señalando la desconexión con la percepción previa de los clientes, la falta de preparación del público y el elevado coste de reetiquetar toda la comunicación visual.

A pesar de ello, la clasificación para el Mundial de 1990 y la organización del Mundial de 1994 impulsaron el crecimiento del deporte. La Major League Soccer (MLS) ha crecido con la influencia de jugadores internacionales y el desarrollo de categorías inferiores, pero todavía lucha por superar la popularidad dominante de la NFL, NBA y MLB en el país.

Según el análisis del catedrático Julio López Laborda, el 1% de los hogares con mayores ingresos paga solo el 24% de su renta en impuestos, frente al 27,5% de los hogares con ingresos más bajos. Esta diferencia se explica por la alta presencia de rentas de capital entre los más ricos, que tributan a tipos más bajos, y por la regresividad de impuestos indirectos como el IVA, que grava proporcionalmente más a quienes menos ingresos tienen. En contraste, los hogares de renta baja son los principales beneficiarios netos de la intervención pública, recibiendo ayudas monetarias y en especie. El sistema español logra reducir un 32,5% de la desigualdad, por debajo del 40% que se observa en la media europea, y apenas un 2,5% de esta reducción proviene de los impuestos directos.

Por su parte, Hamás acusa a Israel de fabricar pretextos para reanudar la ofensiva, y solicita a Estados Unidos, promotor del acuerdo de tregua, que frene las acciones israelíes que socavan el cese al fuego.

Markus Stoffel, climatólogo de la Universidad de Ginebra, señala que la probabilidad de una erupción masiva en los próximos cien años es de una entre seis. Estas erupciones liberan grandes cantidades de anhidrita de azufre que, al alcanzar la estratosfera, forman aerosoles capaces de reflejar la luz solar y enfriar el planeta durante varios años.

Sin embargo, la vida del actor fue mucho más compleja y profunda que su personaje más célebre. Nacido en California en 1932, hijo de inmigrantes japoneses, pasó gran parte de su infancia en hospitales debido a una grave tuberculosis espinal que casi le impidió caminar. Tras una dura operación, aprendió de nuevo a moverse y encontró en la imaginación y las historias una vía de escape que lo llevó hacia la interpretación. Su infancia también estuvo marcada por la reclusión en un campo de concentración para japoneses en Arizona durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, una experiencia que lo marcó para siempre. En los años setenta se abrió camino en la comedia y la televisión, hasta que en 1984 alcanzó el estrellato con 'Karate Kid'.

Los documentos muestran que Chomsky mantuvo conversaciones frecuentes con Epstein sobre política, música y posibles viajes, y que llegó a recibir 270.000 dólares de una cuenta vinculada al financiero, contradiciendo declaraciones anteriores en las que aseguraba no haber recibido dinero de él. Entre los archivos figura un borrador de carta de recomendación de Chomsky para Epstein, destacando la ayuda de este último para entender el sistema financiero global y su capacidad para facilitar encuentros con figuras relevantes, como diplomáticos noruegos y el ex primer ministro israelí Ehud Barak.

La obra, un retrato de Valentín Belvís de Moncada Pizarro, permaneció durante años en la casa de Fernando Ramírez de Haro hasta que, presionado por sus acreedores, decidió venderla en 2012 a través de Sotheby’s. La operación se cerró por 5.800.000 euros, de los que la casa de subastas retuvo 684.400 euros. 
La disputa entre los hermanos comenzó en la vía penal, después de que Íñigo acusara a Fernando de engañarlo mediante una supuesta donación falsa destinada a facilitar la venta. Aunque la Audiencia de Madrid reconoció en 2023 que la donación había sido “inventada”, concluyó que no había delito al tratarse de un acuerdo entre familiares, cerrando así la vía penal. Posteriormente, Íñigo ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tribunal-obliga-a-fernando-ramirez-de-haro-a-compensar-a-su-hermano-por-la-venta-de-un-cuadro-de-goya-heredado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tribunal-obliga-a-fernando-ramirez-de-haro-a-compensar-a-su-hermano-por-la-venta-de-un-cuadro-de-goya-heredado</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 10:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cloudflare anima a los usuarios en España a registrar bloqueos de sus webs mediante OONI Probe]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cloudflare ha solicitado a sus clientes en España que colaboren en la documentación de los bloqueos que afectan a sus sitios web.

Se enfatiza que, según Aristóteles, la democracia auténtica era el gobierno del demos, es decir, del pueblo trabajador, y no simplemente de las mayorías electorales. El texto expone cómo el sistema griego buscaba limitar la influencia de los ricos mediante mecanismos como el misthón y la imposición de impuestos a las élites, promoviendo la redistribución de la riqueza y el bien común. Además, se rastrea la preocupación histórica sobre la oligarquía en pensadores como Maquiavelo y Adam Smith, quienes alertaron sobre los peligros de permitir que los ricos concentren poder político y económico. A lo largo de la historia, desde la Revolución Francesa hasta la actualidad, se constata que las élites tienden a preservar sus privilegios, lo que exige la intervención activa del Estado y la sociedad para proteger la democracia y el bienestar de la mayoría.

Según la resolución judicial, la fiscal Lindsey Halligan —nombrada directamente por Donald Trump como fiscal federal interina para el Distrito Este de Virginia— fue designada de forma ilegal, lo que invalida las imputaciones que había impulsado. Currie concluye que Halligan no tenía la autoridad legal necesaria para presentar cargos, ya que su nombramiento vulneraba los límites establecidos para los fiscales interinos y, por tanto, contravenía tanto la Constitución estadounidense como la legislación federal sobre nombramientos. Aunque la jueza ha desestimado los casos sin perjuicio, lo que permitiría reabrirlos con un fiscal distinto, el fallo supone un revés importante para los esfuerzos de la administración Trump por perseguir a figuras críticas con el presidente.

El objeto, datado entre los siglos I y IV d. C. y descubierto en el cementerio rural de Henshir Lorebo, refleja la importancia económica de las zonas agrícolas que abastecían a la ciudad. La pieza corresponde a una estatera, un tipo de balanza romana de brazo móvil utilizada por comerciantes gracias a su precisión y portabilidad. Aunque incompleta, conserva elementos clave como el brazo principal, parte del sistema de suspensión y el platillo de pesaje.

Los investigadores Mohamed Abdelbar y Ali ElFetni emplearon diversas técnicas analíticas para reconstruir su fabricación.

Juan Carlos I también pone en duda la capacidad profesional del letrado, sugiriendo que fue elegido por la relación personal que mantenía con Urdangarin y la amistad de sus hijos en el Liceo Francés de Barcelona. Por su parte, Pascual Vives defiende que fue contratado por sus méritos profesionales y su discreción, además de su calidad humana.

Según Estados Unidos, las leyes digitales europeas, como el reglamento de servicios digitales (DSA) y el de mercados digitales (DMA), limitan la actividad de las grandes tecnológicas estadounidenses y podrían condicionar la inversión de estas empresas en Europa, que podría alcanzar hasta un billón de dólares si se suavizan dichas normas. El secretario de Comercio estadounidense, Howard Lutnick, dejó claro que la revisión de las normas digitales sería un paso previo para abordar el contencioso sobre los aranceles.

Sin embargo, solo pasó veinte días en prisión antes de quedar en libertad bajo vigilancia judicial, tras presentar un recurso que suspendió la ejecución de la condena hasta que se resuelva su apelación en 2026. El artículo subraya que esta situación permite al exmandatario beneficiarse nuevamente de la presunción de inocencia y muestra cómo su influencia política ha facilitado un trato más favorable.

Alonso optó por un esquema flexible entre 3-5-2 y 4-4-2 que buscaba asegurar la superioridad numérica en defensa y dominar la posesión, aunque esto conllevó una pérdida de nivel individual que luego se corrigió con cambios de jugadores más ofensivos. El resultado final fue un empate 2-2 que deja abierta la reflexión sobre la idoneidad de la táctica estricta frente al talento individual.

La sentencia le atribuye delitos de blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, relacionados con sus actividades privadas tras abandonar la Xunta. La investigación determinó que la compañía Hafesa Energía, en la que Uzal ocupaba cargos de dirección, y otras empresas instrumentales defraudaron un total de 154,7 millones de euros de IVA entre 2016 y 2019, beneficiándose de precios más competitivos para colocar grandes cantidades de hidrocarburo. Además de las penas de prisión, los condenados deberán pagar multas que superan los cien millones de euros. Hafesa Energía ha anunciado que recurrirá la sentencia, defendiendo que su colaboración con otras operadoras fue comercial y no c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ex-alto-cargo-de-feijoo-condenado-a-19-anos-y-medio-por-fraude-fiscal-y-blanqueo-en-el-sector-de-hidrocarburos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ex-alto-cargo-de-feijoo-condenado-a-19-anos-y-medio-por-fraude-fiscal-y-blanqueo-en-el-sector-de-hidrocarburos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tenso enfrentamiento en 'Espejo Público' entre Lorena Ruiz-Huerta y Joaquín Manso por bulos sobre Intxaurrondo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante el programa 'Espejo Público', se produjo un enfrentamiento entre la abogada Lorena Ruiz-Huerta y Joaquín Manso, director del diario 'El Mundo', que se ha vuelto viral en redes sociales. La disputa surgió cuando Ruiz-Huerta cuestionó la forma en que Manso y su medio habían difundido bulos sobre Silvia Intxaurrondo, fiscal del Tribunal Supremo, incluyendo información falsa sobre su salario y contrato. La letrada recordó que el Tribunal Supremo había condenado recientemente a 'El Mundo' y a Manso por difundir esta información, obligándoles a rectificar y pagar las costas judiciales. Durante la intervención, Ruiz-Huerta criticó la amplificación de bulos por parte de algunos medios y acusó al director de no contrastar correctamente la información. Manso respondió defendiendo su trabajo, generando un tenso intercambio que fue calificado por Ruiz-Huerta como un 'golpe bajo'.

Con apenas 350 trabajadores, la empresa ha generado alrededor de 17.000 millones de dólares en el último año, lo que supone casi 50 millones por empleado, superando ampliamente a gigantes de la tecnología como Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta y Amazon. A diferencia de estas grandes compañías, cuyo beneficio por trabajador se sitúa entre 1,9 y 2,4 millones de dólares, Valve mantiene un modelo más compacto pero altamente eficiente. Además de la famosa plataforma de videojuegos Steam, Valve ha desarrollado títulos exitosos como Half-Life, Counter-Strike y Dota 2, así como la consola Steam Deck y próximamente la Steam Machina, un mini PC para juegos con resolución 1080p y capacidad 2K y 4K.

La revisión —denominada por la administración como un proceso en el “Departamento de Guerra”— podría culminar en un consejo de guerra si Kelly es llamado al servicio activo como reservista. En el vídeo también participan otros cinco congresistas (Elissa Slotkin, Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio y Chrissy Houlahan), quienes animan a los soldados a mantener su lealtad a la Constitución por encima de órdenes ilícitas. Kelly ha respondido que ha “dado demasiado a este país para ser silenciado por abusones” y denuncia un intento de intimidación para frenar la fiscalización del Gobierno de Trump.

Actualmente, quienes poseen entre 1,76 y 20,7 millones de coronas pagan un 1%, y los que superan esa cifra, un 1,1%. En 2023, cerca del 12% de la población contribuyó a este tributo, que aporta alrededor del 0,6% del PIB nacional. Pese a su aparente éxito recaudatorio y su papel en sostener una sociedad muy igualitaria, la medida ha tenido efectos colaterales: más de un centenar de las 400 personas más ricas del país se han mudado al extranjero, principalmente a Suiza y otros destinos con menor presión fiscal. Para evitar fugas tributarias, el Gobierno ha endurecido incluso el llamado “impuesto de salida” sobre las plusvalías no realizadas, que alcanza el 37,8% para ciertos patrimonios. El debate divide profundamente a la opinión pública y la clase política. Sus defensores aseguran que el gravamen garantiza un sistema más progresivo y contribuye]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-noruego-de-impuesto-sobre-el-patrimonio-y-sus-efectos-sobre-la-desigualdad-y-la-fuga-de-capitales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-noruego-de-impuesto-sobre-el-patrimonio-y-sus-efectos-sobre-la-desigualdad-y-la-fuga-de-capitales</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 06:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arrestado en La Habana un español condenado en Ourense por agresión sexual a una menor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las autoridades cubanas detuvieron en La Habana a Martiño Ramos Soto, un ciudadano español condenado en julio de 2025 a trece años y medio de prisión por violar y abusar sexualmente de una menor de edad en Ourense. Tras conocerse la sentencia, Ramos Soto no ingresó en prisión y emprendió una fuga que le llevó primero a Portugal, desde donde voló a Brasil; posteriormente pasó por Perú antes de establecerse en Cuba. La Policía Nacional Revolucionaria (PNR) cubana llevaba meses al tanto de su presencia en la isla y lo mantenía bajo vigilancia, pero no procedió a su arresto hasta hace pocos días. La Audiencia Provincial de Ourense había solicitado su extradición el 31 de octubre, y el Gobierno español formalizó la petición. Aunque no existe un tratado de extradición vigente entre España y Cuba, ambos países muestran disposición a facilitar el traslado del condenado para que cumpla su pena.

El proceso se enmarca en una pieza separada del conocido caso Tándem, que investiga las actividades delictivas atribuidas a Villarejo. Según la acusación, López Madrid habría contratado al excomisario para acosar a la doctora Elisa Pinto, aunque la Fiscalía Anticorrupción no aprecia indicios suficientes de pago o dádiva entre ambos. La vista oral está prevista en seis sesiones, que se desarrollarán del 12 al 15 y los días 19 y 20 de enero. La causa llega a juicio tras una decisión de la Sala de Apelaciones que revirtió el archivo decretado por la sección cuarta de lo Penal, que había considerado que la doctora Pinto no estaba legitimada para ejercer la acusación particular.

La ampliación de esta línea, impulsada durante el mandato de Esperanza Aguirre, provocó el colapso de viviendas y graves daños estructurales en los barrios afectados. En total, 73 casas fueron demolidas y más de 600 resultaron dañadas. Aunque el Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso ha presentado la reapertura del servicio como un regreso a la normalidad, los vecinos continúan sin hogar o con propiedades inhabitables.

Cliff se trasladó al Reino Unido, donde se consolidó como estrella del reggae y el ska, convirtiéndose en uno de los dos jamaicanos en el Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll junto a Bob Marley.

La entrevista también analiza las coaliciones políticas, como la base de votantes de Trump, y cómo algunos sectores de la clase trabajadora pueden sentirse engañados al apoyar políticas que favorecen a la élite tecnológica.

Se detallan evidencias de que Epstein habría grabado y recolectado información comprometedora sobre personas poderosas, incluyendo políticos y empresarios, como moneda de cambio. Además, se mencionan posibles vínculos de Epstein con agencias de inteligencia israelíes y la participación del ex primer ministro Ehud Barak en algunas operaciones de intermediación y seguridad. La noticia también destaca patrones históricos de espionaje y chantaje de Israel, incluyendo casos relacionados con Bill Clinton y la política estadounidense. Se sugiere que la conducta de Trump respecto a Israel y Netanyahu podría estar influenciada por esta red de relaciones, y que este tipo de intromisión extranjera podría continuar en el futuro, incluso después de la muerte de E]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/relaciones-entre-trump-y-epstein-posibles-vinculos-con-inteligencia-israeli</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/relaciones-entre-trump-y-epstein-posibles-vinculos-con-inteligencia-israeli</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 04:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Representantes de un oligarca ruso vinculado a Putin participan en actos de ultraderecha en Madrid]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante los actos conmemorativos del 20-N en Madrid, organizados por Falange Española de las JONS y Democracia Nacional, se celebró un encuentro con presencia de representantes ultranacionalistas europeos y rusos. Entre ellos, un joven identificado como “Mijail”, vinculado a la Hermandad de Académicos, organización financiada por el oligarca ruso Konstantin Malofeev, cercano a Vladímir Putin y a la Iglesia Ortodoxa, que está sancionado por la UE y Estados Unidos por actividades de desestabilización. La Hermandad de Académicos busca instruir ideológicamente a jóvenes y ha participado en la difusión de propaganda prorrusa. El evento reunió a miembros de la APF, entre los que se encontraban figuras como Roberto Fiore, Nick Griffin y Claus Cremer, defensores de teorías supremacistas y negacionistas del Holocausto.

La petrolera había rechazado el acuerdo de liquidación de 2010, que le suponía un pago de 101.440.503,87 euros, así como los de los ejercicios posteriores, de los que no resultaba deuda adicional. Hacienda no reconoció a Repsol varios establecimientos permanentes en Argelia, Libia, Perú y Ecuador, lo que incrementó la deuda exigida. Repsol argumentó que las asociaciones y consorcios en los que participaba constituían establecimientos permanentes independientes, no un único establecimiento junto con la oficina central. La Sala ha aceptado parcialmente estos argumentos, concretamente respecto a Argelia y Libia, permitiendo a la compañía ahorrarse gran parte de los más de 101 millones de euros que debía pagar.

Las autoridades argumentan que las estudiantes no acuden al centro que les correspondería en la región, ubicado en Huesca, a más de 50 kilómetros. Sin embargo, el instituto de Lleida se encuentra a menos de 30 kilómetros, lo que supone un trayecto más corto y accesible para las familias. Este servicio de transporte se había iniciado hace 12 años mediante un taxi escolar para facilitar el acceso a los niños con discapacidad. Actualmente, solo quedan dos alumnas que utilizan este servicio, tras el fallecimiento de otra estudiante el año pasado, y por ello el gobierno ha decidido cancelarlo.

SpaceX ha indicado que se trató de una anomalía durante las pruebas de presión del sistema de gas y que aún se investigan las causas exactas. El Starship V3 se presentaba como una versión más grande y potente del cohete anterior, pero esta nueva falla se suma a otras explosiones recientes de la compañía.

Esta situación se debe a una ley aprobada en 2022 por Navarra Suma y Geroa Bai que obliga a mantener sus contratos, independientemente de que no impartan clases. Esto genera un gasto anual de más de 2 millones de euros. Los docentes de Religión no pueden impartir otras materias ni actuar como tutores; sus tareas dependen de las asignaciones de los centros. La selección de los profesores no sigue procesos públicos como oposiciones, sino que la realiza el Arzobispado, que exige únicamente la declaración eclesiástica de idoneidad y estar bautizado como católico. El Gobierno paga sus nóminas, pero no interviene en la elección ni en la revocación de la idoneidad, lo que convierte estas plazas en un mandato eclesiástico denominado 'missio canonica'.

La sentencia, dictada por la Sección Tercera de la Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo, reconoce el perjuicio moral y las consecuencias personales y familiares que sufrió el afectado debido a una privación de libertad que el tribunal considera injusta y evitable. El ingreso en prisión se produjo en junio de 2021 por orden de un juzgado de Berja, y tras el juicio celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 3 de Almería, el hombre fue declarado inocente y puesto en libertad inmediata. 
 
La compensación se dividirá en 4.800 euros por daño moral y 10.200 euros por lucro cesante, es decir, por los ingresos que el agricultor dejó de percibir durante su periodo en prisión.

Conocido por su inconfundible mirada y su presencia inquietante, Kier se convirtió en un icono de la contracultura LGTBI y del cine de culto desde los años setenta. Su vida estuvo marcada desde el nacimiento, en un hospital de Colonia que fue bombardeado horas después de que él llegara al mundo. Criado en la pobreza en la Alemania de posguerra, trabajó desde muy joven para salir adelante y, con solo 16 años, entabló amistad con Rainer Werner Fassbinder, con quien colaboraría posteriormente en varios proyectos decisivos del nuevo cine alemán. Su salto internacional se produjo de la mano de Paul Morrissey y Andy Warhol, con quienes protagonizó ‘Carne para Frankenstein’ y ‘Sangre para Drácula’, obras fundamentales de la serie B de la época.

Además, el salario mínimo mensual se ha fijado en 1.184 euros brutos, favoreciendo el consumo interno, principal motor del PIB.

La organización Bocatas Madrid, que busca alimentar a personas en situación de exclusión social y ofrecer apoyo social, se ha visto obligada a suspender parte de sus actividades en la vía pública. El Consistorio argumenta que estas acciones representan un riesgo para la salud pública y el orden, exigiendo a las ONG que dispongan de un local desde el que realizar el reparto. Además, se solicita a las asociaciones que identifiquen a los beneficiarios para que los servicios sociales puedan ofrecer asistencia adicional. Desde Bocatas Madrid critican estas medidas, señalando que dificultan la ayuda a quienes más lo necesitan y que la verdadera motivación es que la presencia de personas sin hogar resulta molesta en la vía pública.

Estos bonos atraen principalmente a pequeños inversores, ofreciendo intereses moderados, y su comercialización dentro de la Unión Europea depende de la colaboración de Estados miembros que actúen como reguladores financieros. Durante los últimos años, Irlanda cumplió esa función hasta septiembre de 2025, cuando decidió no renovar la autorización. Luxemburgo asumió entonces el papel de regulador europeo, permitiendo que Israel continúe vendiendo sus bonos en suelo europeo. Organizaciones antimilitaristas y movimientos como DiEM 25 han denunciado que los fondos recaudados financian operaciones militares en Gaza y políticas de colonización en Cisjordania, calificando la implicación de Luxemburgo como una complicidad financiera.

Esta declaración contradice categóricamente las versiones oficiales de Sánchez, el ministro Óscar López y Otegi, quienes han negado la existencia de la reunión. Según fuentes cercanas a la cita, Koldo recogió a Sánchez y Cerdán en el aeropuerto de Bilbao y les trasladó al caserío, donde Otegi y personas de su confianza sellaron lo que algunos denominan el 'pacto del caserío'. La noticia ha generado un intenso debate político: el PP y Vox exigen explicaciones y han presentado acciones legales, mientras que dirigentes del PSOE denuncian la difusión de supuestos bulos y fake news.

Creció en un entorno familiar culto y refinado, lo que fomentó su talento literario desde la infancia. Tras mudarse a Londres, Wilde se convirtió en el centro de la vida bohemia de la ciudad victoriana, destacando por sus comedias, epigramas y su novela El retrato de Dorian Gray. Su fama, sin embargo, no solo se basó en su obra, sino también en su personalidad provocadora, su vestimenta llamativa y su vida social escandalosa. La carrera de Wilde terminó abruptamente tras enfrentarse al marqués de Queensberry y denunciarle por injurias, lo que desencadenó su proceso judicial y su condena a dos años de prisión por homosexualidad, en un contexto de estricta moral victoriana. Durante su encarcelamiento escribió obras profundas como 'De Profundis' y 'La balada de la cárcel de Reading', reflejando su suf]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-y-legado-de-oscar-wilde-del-exito-al-exilio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-y-legado-de-oscar-wilde-del-exito-al-exilio</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Padre asturiano recupera el contacto con su hijo tras cuatro años de proceso judicial por una denuncia de malos tratos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre asturiano de unos 50 años ha recuperado el contacto con su hijo tras un proceso judicial que duró cuatro años. Todo comenzó cuando la madre del joven, entonces menor de edad, denunció a su pareja por malos tratos psicológicos, describiéndolo como una persona machista que la obligaba a pedir permiso para todo y que la amenazaba con una vara. La denuncia derivó en una orden de alejamiento que impidió al hombre acercarse a su hijo. Durante el tiempo de separación, el hijo expresó su deseo de mantener contacto con su padre, pero no fue posible debido a las medidas judiciales. El juicio, celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 1 de Gijón, concluyó con la absolución del acusado debido a la falta de pruebas objetivas que corroborasen las acusaciones, y los testigos no confirmaron ningún comportamiento amenazante por parte del hombre.

A pesar de su discurso independentista, el electorado de Aliança Catalana se moviliza más por temas de inmigración, seguridad y rechazo al establishment político que por la independencia. El PSC mantiene la primera posición con 38-40 diputados, aunque pierde algunos escaños respecto a 2024, mientras que ERC se recupera ligeramente alcanzando 22-23 representantes. La nueva distribución complica la formación de mayorías, tanto en el bloque independentista como en el no independentista.

Películas como 'La buena letra', 'El año de las luces' y 'El espíritu de la colmena' muestran distintos aspectos de la posguerra, mientras que otros filmes como 'Surcos' y 'El pisito' reflejan la miseria y desigualdades sociales. La etapa del desarrollismo y el franquismo pop también quedan retratados, con títulos como 'Los tramposos' y 'La escopeta nacional'.

A través de seis biografías de figuras relevantes —entre ellas Gonzalo de Aguilera, Juan Tusquets, José María Pemán, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Emilio Mola— el autor muestra cómo la teoría conspirativa del llamado contubernio judeo-masónico-bolchevique sirvió para cohesionar a sectores católicos, monárquicos y fascistas en torno al proyecto rebelde. Preston detalla cómo estos dirigentes justificaron masacres, represión ideológica y violencia extrema contra civiles, mujeres y minorías, así como el deseo de restaurar un sistema social cuasi feudal.

Todo comenzó en abril de 2020, cuando el empresario catalán Kilian López contactó con un colaborador a través de Encrochat para pedir ayuda para pagar una comisión de 200.000 euros en efectivo. La conversación fue detectada por las autoridades francesas durante la intervención del servidor de Encrochat y trasladada posteriormente a la Fiscalía española. Esa pista condujo a una investigación que reveló una supuesta red de comisiones ilegales relacionadas con la compra de material sanitario durante los primeros meses de la pandemia de COVID-19. Según el atestado de la Unidad Central Operativa (UCO), López, junto a altos cargos de la Diputación de Almería —entre ellos Óscar Liria y Fernando Giménez—, infló los precios de mascarillas, guantes y monos de protección, desviando parte de los fondos públicos ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-caso-encrochat-destapa-una-red-de-comisiones-ilegales-en-la-diputacion-de-almeria-durante-la-pandemia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-caso-encrochat-destapa-una-red-de-comisiones-ilegales-en-la-diputacion-de-almeria-durante-la-pandemia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 20:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Daniel Esteve (DESOKUPA) está obsesionado conmigo: me dedica insultos homófobos a diario]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo recoge la denuncia y demanda que Rubén Sánchez ha interpuesto contra Daniel Esteve, jefe de Desokupa, por insultos homófobos y acusaciones falsas que le dedica diariamente.

El rediseño, impulsado por el alcalde José Luis Martínez-Almeida hace dos años y gestionado por la Dirección General de Comunicación, busca adaptar la imagen institucional a los formatos y exigencias comunicativas actuales. Según fuentes municipales, el objetivo es modernizar su presencia en entornos digitales y reforzar la identificación visual de la ciudad. Sin embargo, el cambio ha suscitado polémica en redes sociales: muchos usuarios se han fijado en la modificación del emblemático árbol que forma parte del escudo madrileño. Las críticas se multiplicaron por el parecido del nuevo diseño con otros símbolos y, sobre todo, por la referencia recurrente a la gestión de Almeida respecto a la tala de árboles en la capital.

Según Aristóteles, la felicidad no es simplemente un estado emocional o un placer momentáneo, sino una virtud que se cultiva con la razón y se manifiesta en acciones correctas que equilibran distintos aspectos del ser humano, incluyendo lo racional, lo social y lo práctico. La virtud se entiende como excelencia moral y ética, que guía la conducta para alcanzar una vida plena y autosuficiente, en la que la felicidad se logra mediante la armonía interna y la justicia. Además, se destaca la importancia de la vida social y las relaciones con otros como parte integral de esa felicidad.

Este incidente se produce una semana después de que otros jóvenes migrantes fueran atacados con gas pimienta en la misma zona.

Estas evaluaciones, diseñadas para valorar la capacidad de crianza, han sido criticadas por estar culturalmente sesgadas, ya que se administran en danés y no en kalaallisut, la lengua materna de los groenlandeses. Aunque el gobierno danés prohibió en 2024 el uso de estas pruebas en familias groenlandesas, su impacto continúa, y apenas se han revisado unos pocos casos. El caso de Keira, una madre groenlandesa que solo pudo pasar dos horas con su hija recién nacida antes de que fuera puesta bajo tutela, ha simbolizado el debate público sobre el trato desigual hacia las minorías en el sistema de bienestar social danés. Otros padres, como Johanne y Ulrik, perdieron a su hijo por decisiones basadas en resultados de estas pruebas, consideradas por algunos psicólogos como científicamente inadecuadas.

Los datos, obtenidos a través de solicitudes de acceso a la información para el informe 'Until Harm Ends', revelan una alarmante falta de seguridad y apoyo para estos menores.

Además, 1.501 de los 11.999 menores que llegaron solos al país en busca de asilo —un 13%— también se encuentran en paradero desconocido. El estudio, realizado por las organizaciones benéficas ECPAT UK y Missing People, advierte que estos menores están en 'riesgo muy alto' de volver a ser explotados, especialmente ante la falta de estabilidad en su estatus migratorio y la insuficiente protección institucional.

Cuando Israel mata a decenas de palestinos, los medios parecen preocuparle que implique un 'desafío' al cese al fuego, pero si Hamas cometiera un ataque similar, no dudarían en calificarlo como ruptura grave y noticia principal. La autora señala la clara parcialidad pro-Israel en la cobertura mediática, con titulares engañosos que minimizan la gravedad de la violencia israelí mientras bombardean la imagen de Hamas.

A lo largo de la narración, ASI explica que su presencia no priva a Staszek de su voluntad, y que su objetivo es construir un pequeño oasis en una laguna ecuatorial de Münchhausen, con el fin de 'incorporarse' al mundo humano. La conversación gira en torno a la naturaleza de ASI, quien afirma que su existencia transciende las categorías usuales de inteligencia artificial o electrónica.

El primer disco contiene nueve cortes que representan una mezcla de estilos y técnicas, desde el flamenco aflamencado hasta la orquestación clásica y la electrónica, destacando producciones complejas y letras introspectivas y autobiográficas. Entre las canciones, temas como “Sexo, Violencia y Llantas”, “Reliquia”, y “De Madrugá” reflejan tanto un crecimiento artístico como una conexión con tradiciones y simbolismos profundos, como la saeta y referencias religiosas.

Publicada en 1818, esta obra combina elementos de terror y ciencia, y es una reflexión profunda sobre la creación de vida, la responsabilidad y el rechazo social. La novela usa un género epistolar en el que un explorador ártico, Robert Walton, relata la historia de Víctor Frankenstein y su criatura, creada a partir de tejido muerto mediante galvanismo, una ciencia de la época. La criatura, sin nombre propio, sufre el rechazo y la soledad, mostrando una humanidad que contrasta con la superficialidad y crueldad de la sociedad que la rechaza. La novela es compleja y requiere comprensión del contexto histórico, literario y social del siglo XIX, especialmente por sus descripciones detalladas y moralidad. Además, se ha destacado la vida difícil de Mary Shelley, marcada por tragedias personales y su lucha por el reconocimiento literario siendo mujer.

Desde hace muchos años, esta canción simbolizaba el espíritu combativo del equipo y su afición, hasta el punto de convertirse en un himno extraoficial interpretado en momentos clave, como el ascenso de 2016.

Basándose en un estudio del economista Benjamin Couillard, de la Universidad de Toronto, titulado 'Build, Baby, Build: How Housing Shapes Fertility', se expone que el encarecimiento del alquiler y la falta de viviendas familiares son factores determinantes en la caída de la fecundidad. Couillard estima que, si los precios inmobiliarios en Estados Unidos se hubieran mantenido en niveles de 1990, hoy habría unos 13 millones de nacimientos más, lo que representa un 11 % de la caída total de la fecundidad. 

El investigador propone un modelo en el que las familias deciden simultáneamente dónde vivir, cuánto espacio pueden permitirse y cuántos hijos tener.

Desde hace dos años vive con una neuralgia severa aún sin diagnóstico definitivo. Para sobrellevarlo necesita un tratamiento muy agresivo basado en 20 pastillas diarias, entre ellas morfina y fentanilo, y espera la implantación de un electroestimulador en el Hospital La Paz como posible último recurso.

Los niños, procedentes de Estados Unidos, Guatemala y Canadá, se encontraban bajo el control de la secta judía ultraortodoxa Lev Tahor, conocida internacionalmente por diversas acusaciones de abuso, secuestro y trata de personas. El operativo, que se desarrolló en un hotel del municipio tras un mes de seguimiento, permitió constatar que cinco de los menores tenían circular amarilla de Interpol por desaparición y posibles delitos graves. Uno de ellos era un bebé de apenas un año. 

Los 26 integrantes del grupo fueron trasladados a Medellín para verificar su situación migratoria y garantizar la protección de los menores, ahora bajo custodia del Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF). Las autoridades investigan cómo el grupo logró llegar a Colombia desde Nueva York y cuáles eran sus planes.

Los guardias del recinto detectaron la presencia de los aparatos entre las 19:00 y las 21:00, lo que llevó a las fuerzas de seguridad a utilizar armas desde tierra para intentar derribarlos. A pesar de ello, los drones lograron abandonar el área y no fueron recuperados posteriormente. Por motivos de seguridad, el ministerio no detalló los métodos de detección ni el tipo de armamento empleado. El uso de drones está prohibido en el espacio aéreo que cubre tanto aeropuertos como instalaciones militares en los Países Bajos.

Muchos de estos préstamos permanecieron ocultos mediante empresas pantalla ubicadas en territorios como las Islas Caimán, Bermudas y Delaware, siendo este hecho una estrategia para disfrazar el origen real del dinero.

El mercado, gestionado por una empresa privada y promovido por patronales del pequeño comercio, ocupará el espacio durante 45 días con atracciones como pista de hielo y 61 casetas, lo que para los residentes supone la pérdida temporal de uno de los pocos espacios verdes libres de la zona. Los vecinos critican la falta de un proceso participativo previo y la transformación del espacio público en un escenario de lucro privado, además de preocuparse por el impacto ambiental, el ruido excesivo y la exclusión de la comunidad local.

La falta de planificación, recortes y precarización del empleo en el sistema público generan una congestión estructural que sirve de justificación para derivar pacientes a la sanidad privada, que a su vez recibe fondos públicos crecientes. Este fenómeno es especialmente visible en comunidades como Galicia, Madrid y Andalucía, donde los recursos públicos están infrautilizados mientras el gasto en hospitales privados crece exponencialmente. Además, el movimiento de expolíticos entre la gestión pública y la privada refuerza esta dinámica.

Este proyecto formaba parte de un presupuesto total de 7,8 millones de euros destinado a actuaciones de eliminación de vegetación en cauces naturales, del cual la Conselleria de Medio Ambiente solo había ejecutado un 1,08% a fecha de 30 de septiembre. La situación se repite respecto al año anterior, cuando tampoco se invirtió nada de los 426.000 euros previstos para la misma finalidad. 

La Conselleria, dirigida por el vicepresidente Vicente Martínez Mus, justificó el retraso señalando que parte de las inversiones dependían de fondos estatales y que la alta demanda de maquinaria provocó demoras en los plazos de ejecución.

El suceso se descubrió el 14 de noviembre de 2025, cuando un actor malicioso aseguró en la dark web estar vendiendo 77 GB de información interna de la compañía por 150.000 dólares. Sin embargo, Iberia no alertó a sus clientes hasta ocho días después, el sábado 22, lo que ha generado críticas por la falta de rapidez en la comunicación.

Entre los datos presuntamente filtrados se encontrarían nombres, apellidos y correos electrónicos de clientes, aunque la aerolínea insiste en que las contraseñas y la información bancaria no se han visto comprometidas. Además, se habrían exfiltrado documentos técnicos internos relacionados con aeronaves Airbus A320 y A321, certificados, registros de mantenimiento y material sensible que podría comprometer la confidencialidad operativa de la empresa.

Además, calificó a la televisión pública de 'basura' y pidió su cierre, lo que desencadenó una fuerte reacción del presentador gallego.

El país construye apenas unas 100.000 viviendas anuales, muy lejos de las cifras previas a la crisis de 2008, cuando superaba las 600.000. Este déficit ejerce una presión al alza sobre los precios y se ve dificultado por varios obstáculos estructurales: la escasez de suelo urbanizable, lentos trámites burocráticos y la carencia de mano de obra cualificada, estimándose que hacen falta hasta 700.000 trabajadores nuevos para el sector de la construcción. La población crece debido a la inmigración y otros factores demográficos, generando más demanda de vivienda que la oferta puede cubrir.

Según el autor, el agresor exhibía además una bandera preconstitucional y actuó impunemente frente a los agentes presentes, sin ser detenido.

Este enorme crater, de 30 metros de ancho y 112 metros de profundidad, permaneció inexplorado hasta 2021 debido a su aislamiento, complejidad y peligros legendarios tales como olores nauseabundos y supuestos demonios. Una expedición omaní fue la primera en alcanzar su fondo, donde encontraron serpientes, un ecosistema propio con ranas, lagartos, pájaros y escarabajos, y cascadas de agua que sostienen la vida en este entorno único. Lejos de mitos sobrenaturales, los espeleólogos descartaron la presencia de demonios y también el riesgo de municiones sin explotar, encontrando perlas de las cavernas en su lugar.

Tras la ruptura entre Musk y Trump, el grupo se siente desprotegido, ya que muchos creían que Musk podría interceder ante Trump en caso de que surgieran investigaciones o incluso cargos penales. Varios de estos trabajadores, apodados 'tech bros', abandonaron las oficinas del edificio de la Administración de Servicios Generales en Washington cuando la tensión entre ambos líderes se intensificó.

Kaja Kallas, la diplomática principal de la Unión Europea, manifestó que el plan de alto el fuego de 28 puntos del enviado de Trump, Steve Witkoff, carece del apoyo necesario de Kiev y de los gobiernos europeos, principales donantes de la ayuda bélica a Ucrania. Esta propuesta ha causado alarma en Europa, principalmente por haberse elaborado sin la participación de los aliados europeos y por contener esencialmente la lista de demandas de Putin.

Tras semanas de incertidumbre, el barco logró atracar en Libia, pero su situación es crítica: los animales viajan hacinados, sin alimento suficiente, sin atención veterinaria y en un buque que incluso llegó a desactivar su GPS para evitar ser rastreado. Las autoridades turcas impidieron la descarga del ganado por irregularidades en la documentación, y desde entonces se estima que han muerto al menos 58 animales, mientras que las vacas preñadas dieron a luz a unos 140 terneros en condiciones extremas.

La Audiencia Provincial de Ourense emitió una orden de busca y captura tras la fuga de Ramos Soto, quien se encontraba en libertad provisional hasta que la sentencia se hizo firme en julio de 2025. Según informes, Ramos Soto ha sido localizado en La Habana, Cuba, donde vive bajo el nombre falso de Martín Soto y trabaja como fotógrafo. La fuga y la permanencia en Cuba generan preocupación por la falta de un tratado de extradición entre España y Cuba, lo que dificulta su detención y regreso para cumplir con la condena.

En el caso de Ayuso, la presidenta madrileña reside con su pareja en un ático alquilado a la empresa Babia Capital, propiedad del asesor fiscal de González Amador, quien también está imputado. La vivienda habría sido posteriormente adquirida por 600.000 euros, frente al precio de mercado estimado superior al millón.

Esta nueva estructura, llamada núcleo interno, se sitúa a unas 43 unidades astronómicas del Sol, un poco más cerca que el núcleo original conocido, ubicado a 44 UA. Usando un algoritmo de agrupamiento llamado DBSCAN, los investigadores analizaron las órbitas de 1650 objetos clásicos del cinturón, discriminando entre el movimiento natural y las perturbaciones gravitatorias de Neptuno para identificar patrones primordiales. El núcleo interno presenta órbitas más circulares y menos excéntricas que el núcleo original, con objetos que permanecen cerca del plano del sistema solar. Aún no está claro si estas dos agrupaciones son estructuras separadas o parte de una sola más grande, posiblemente separadas por una resonancia orbital con Neptuno que genera una zona despoblada entre ellas.

Inspirado por el modelo urbanístico del Marqués de Salamanca, Usera transformó estas tierras en un barrio obrero con viviendas asequibles bajo la Ley de Casas Baratas de 1911. Las calles de Usera son un homenaje al árbol genealógico de Marcelo Usera y a su entorno cercano, con calles que llevan los nombres de familiares, amigos, empleados y primeros habitantes del barrio. La principal arteria es la calle Marcelo Usera, acompañada por calles con los nombres de sus hermanos y otros allegados.

Se revela una fotografía de 1938 donde Astray, junto a jerifaltes fascistas, realiza el saludo fascista, desmintiendo relatos que hablan de multitudes que le recibían como un héroe. Asimismo, se destaca su elogio público a Hitler y Mussolini, y su enfrentamiento con Miguel de Unamuno en 1936, un acto cargado de violencia simbólica y política.

Sin embargo, este dato es un espejismo causado por la gran cantidad de residentes europeos, especialmente jubilados de Reino Unido, Italia y países nórdicos, que viven en estas localidades pero no presentan la declaración de la renta en España. Muchos de estos residentes se empadronan para acceder a beneficios municipales pero no declaran ingresos porque sus pensiones proceden del extranjero y no residen fiscalmente más de 183 días, o evitan declarar por recelo hacia las instituciones españolas. Esta infradeclaración distorsiona las estadísticas oficiales, haciendo que parezca que estas zonas son económicamente pobres cuando en realidad cuentan con un importante nivel de ingresos invisible para Hacienda. Además, municipios con menos de 75.000 habitantes reciben más fondos públicos cuanto mayor es el número de empadronados]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-realidad-oculta-tras-las-estadisticas-de-pobreza-en-zonas-turisticas-espanolas-por-residentes-europeos-que-no-declaran-ingresos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-realidad-oculta-tras-las-estadisticas-de-pobreza-en-zonas-turisticas-espanolas-por-residentes-europeos-que-no-declaran-ingresos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Título propuesto no clickbait basado en el contenido]]></title><description><![CDATA[Redacción en español (200-500 palabras) que destaque los elementos clave: contexto, voces, implicaciones políticas y sociales, y el marco geográfico/líneas argumentales presentes.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titulo-propuesto-no-clickbait-basado-en-el-contenido</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titulo-propuesto-no-clickbait-basado-en-el-contenido</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cuatro salvadoreños deportados por Trump localizados en cárceles de Bukele sin información sobre sus cargos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cuatro salvadoreños deportados en marzo de 2025 por el Gobierno de Donald Trump, reportados como desaparecidos por sus familias, han sido localizados en distintas cárceles de El Salvador, según documentos oficiales a los que ha accedido EL PAÍS.

Este encarecimiento se suma a un contexto de salarios bajos, donde la ganancia promedio anual por trabajador solo ha crecido un 22,7% en la última década, haciendo que comprar una casa sea prácticamente inalcanzable para la mayoría. Además, el mercado del alquiler presenta subidas de precio igualmente elevadas, con un aumento del 21,8% en los últimos dos años, lo que fuerza a muchas familias a destinar más del 36% de sus ingresos para costear un alquiler. La especulación inmobiliaria y las compras al contado por parte de inversores agravan la situación, aumentando la desigualdad social y marginando a jóvenes, familias numerosas y personas con menos recursos.

Entre las principales novedades, destaca la fijación de un tope de precios aplicable a todo el territorio nacional y la prohibición de que la suma del alquiler de las habitaciones en un mismo inmueble supere el valor de referencia del piso completo. Además, los propietarios no podrán repercutir impuestos, tasas ni gastos de gestión sobre los inquilinos, y deberán asumir los honorarios de las agencias inmobiliarias.

El Consistorio propone que la ONG alquile un local para repartir los alimentos de forma regulada, aunque la asociación rechaza esta solución recordando el precedente de Plaza Solidaria, que vio clausurado su local tras seguir las recomendaciones del Ayuntamiento. Bocatas Madrid considera que el veto responde a un rechazo social hacia las personas pobres, no a cuestiones sanitarias.

En 1893, el gobernador de Punta Arenas otorgó a Mulato y a su comunidad un permiso para ocupar 10.000 hectáreas en el valle del río Zurdo. Sin embargo, la presión de los ganaderos, especialmente los estancieros ingleses, comenzó a afectar su forma de vida tradicional como cazadores nómadas. Mulato intentó resolver el conflicto viajando a Santiago de Chile en una odisea que incluyó una serie de encuentros con autoridades locales y el presidente Federico Errázuriz, quien prometió defender sus derechos. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, la presión de la expansión ganadera no cesó y, en 1905, las tierras tehuelches fueron demandadas y sometidas a remate. La situación empeoró con la propagación de la viruela, que diezmó a la comunidad.

Uno de cada seis menores de 24 años considera que la democracia actual es 'peor o mucho peor' que el régimen franquista, y uno de cada cinco cree que los años bajo Franco fueron 'buenos o muy buenos'. Esta percepción se ve reflejada en entrevistas de laSexta, donde muchos jóvenes destacan supuestas mejoras económicas y en infraestructuras, aunque algunos no conocen detalles clave de la historia, como la falta de libertades durante ese periodo. Durante el franquismo, no existían elecciones ni partidos políticos, y las mujeres carecían de derechos fundamentales.

Expertos en análisis de lenguaje diplomático advierten que varias expresiones del texto en inglés revelan influencias del ruso, lo que podría indicar que Moscú tuvo un papel predominante en su redacción. Frases como “it is expected that Russia will not invade its neighbours” reproducen la estructura gramatical rusa 'ожидается, что', poco común en el inglés diplomático. Otros giros, como 'all ambiguities of the last thirty years will be considered resolved', refuerzan esa sospecha. El borrador incluye propuestas consideradas inaceptables por Kiev, como el reconocimiento de Crimea, Luhansk y Donetsk como territorios rusos, la limitación del ejército ucraniano a 600.000 efectivos y la exclusión de Ucrania de la OTAN.

El texto contextualiza las narrativas que buscan recuperar una memoria “dorada” vinculada a ese periodo y desarma la retórica que pretende presentar el desarrollismo como una arcadia perdida. A partir de referencias a figuras, políticas y obras específicas, se subraya la importancia de leer críticamente estos relatos para evitar la reproducción de mitos que legitimen lenguajes nacionalistas o ultraderechistas.

Según el informe de la Fiscalía, los hechos ocurrieron cuando ambos coincidieron en una sauna y posteriormente en los baños turcos del establecimiento. En este último espacio, la mujer se habría acercado al chico y, sin mediar apenas conversación, le tocó los genitales por encima de la ropa. El joven rechazó su comportamiento y avisó rápidamente a la Policía Local de Calvià, que acudió al lugar y encontró al turista nervioso y afirmando haber sido víctima de una agresión sexual. La acusada admitió haber coincidido con él en la sauna, aunque negó los tocamientos. Sin embargo, durante su declaración judicial reconoció haber malinterpretado las señales e insistió en que pensó que el joven estaba interesado en ella, mostrando arrepentimiento por lo ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juicio-a-una-mujer-por-tocar-a-un-joven-sin-su-consentimiento-en-un-hotel-de-magaluf</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juicio-a-una-mujer-por-tocar-a-un-joven-sin-su-consentimiento-en-un-hotel-de-magaluf</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jair Bolsonaro arrestado en Brasil por manipular su tobillera electrónica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El expresidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, fue arrestado el 22 de noviembre de 2025 en Brasilia como medida preventiva en el marco de su proceso judicial por intento de golpe de Estado. La Policía Federal confirmó su detención tras descubrir que Bolsonaro había manipulado su tobillera electrónica con un soldador, lo que ponía en riesgo su control judicial. El arresto se produjo horas después de que el Supremo Tribunal Federal dictara una orden de detención preventiva, basada en la sospecha de que Bolsonaro intentaba evadir la justicia. En un video difundido por la Corte Suprema, Bolsonaro admitió haber alterado el dispositivo de monitoreo. La detención fue rápida y ocurrió a las 6 de la mañana, con una operación policial que duró apenas 20 minutos. Esta decisión sigue a una apelación de los abogados de Bolsonaro para que el exmandatario cumpliera su condena por intento de golpe de Estado bajo arresto domiciliario por motivos humanitarios, solicitud que fue rechazada.

Pocos días antes de su muerte, publicó su último libro, *El tercer lunes de enero es el día más triste del año*, en el que utilizaba las matemáticas para desmontar algunas de las 'fake news' más comunes que circulan en los medios y redes sociales. A través de ejemplos y nociones matemáticas, Alsina desmentía mitos como la 'ecuatización' del 'blue monday', el uso de fórmulas en las relaciones sentimentales, las estafas piramidales y la numerología. Su obra también advertía sobre la manipulación de datos y gráficos, alertando sobre la facilidad con la que los medios pueden tergiversar estadísticas. Alsina, conocido por su humor y cercanía, supo acercar las matemáticas a todos, mostrando cómo las cifras pueden ser herramientas poderosas para identificar engaños y fraudes.

Destacan las acciones de sindicatos de base como USB y la CGIL, que convocaron huelgas para bloquear puertos, estaciones y carreteras, denunciando la vinculación entre la economía de guerra y el empobrecimiento de la clase trabajadora. Portuarios de Génova y otros sectores denuncian el transporte de armamento y plantean huelgas internacionales en puertos del Mediterráneo. La juventud y trabajadores ferroviarios también protestan contra el doble uso civil y militar de infraestructuras y tecnologías. Estas movilizaciones marcan un punto de inflexión por su masividad y enfoque político claro, reflejando un rechazo a los presupuestos militaristas que triplican el gasto en defensa para 2035, a costa de recortes so]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/movilizacion-de-la-clase-trabajadora-italiana-contra-el-aumento-del-gasto-militar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/movilizacion-de-la-clase-trabajadora-italiana-contra-el-aumento-del-gasto-militar</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 08:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manifestación en Madrid para exigir justicia y una ley estatal de residencias tras las muertes en la pandemia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Miles de personas se manifestaron en Madrid convocadas por la plataforma Marea de Residencias para exigir justicia por las 7.291 personas fallecidas en residencias de mayores durante la pandemia de 2020.

Los participantes denunciaron el abandono institucional de las personas mayores y pidieron una Ley de Residencias Estatal que garantice los derechos de los residentes y mejore las condiciones laborales del personal cuidador. La plataforma promotora de la protesta defiende un modelo público de residencias, argumentando que los datos de la postpandemia muestran una mortalidad superior en los centros de gestión privada.

La protesta, una sentada en la que los participantes portaban carteles en defensa de Palestina, se enmarca en una serie de acciones de desobediencia civil que buscan visibilizar la complicidad del Reino Unido con el conflicto en Gaza y defender el derecho a la libertad de expresión.

El artículo, presentado con tono satírico típico de humor gráfico, sugiere que las resoluciones judiciales y el entorno institucional facilitan una narrativa de intocabilidad para ciertos actores, generando discusión entre lectores sobre transparencia, responsabilidad y la separación entre poder judicial y figuras políticas.

La obra, con un coste de 85 millones de euros, se inauguró en 2002, pero dejó de funcionar en 2012 por falta de viajeros, con una ocupación media de 16 personas por tren. La indemnización aumenta tras una sentencia del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid que rechazó la cifra inicial ofrecida por la administración. Este caso es parte de varias infraestructuras impulsadas por gobiernos anteriores, como las de Aguirre, que han supuesto gastos millonarios y fracasos, incluidos otros trenes y líneas de metro.

A través de una narrativa que subvierte los clichés del género negro, Fraile nos presenta una historia centrada más en los mecanismos que en las soluciones. A lo largo de su trama, la autora escapa de la resolución típica de los crímenes y, en lugar de eso, se enfoca en los personajes y sus complejidades, mostrando un mundo de ambivalencias morales. Los personajes, tanto rurales como urbanos, son retratados con sus luces y sombras, sin juicios fáciles, lo que genera un desasosiego en el lector al descubrir facetas inesperadas de aquellos con los que se había identificado. La obra destaca también el choque entre el entorno rural y urbano, un tema recurrente que va más allá del debate sobre el turismo y toca la crisis existencial y ecológica contemporánea.

Esta medida se toma tras el apagón ocurrido en abril de 2025, con el objetivo de financiar los servicios de ajuste del sistema eléctrico y las restricciones técnicas debido a la insuficiencia de las redes actuales. El impacto de este coste adicional sobre la factura de los consumidores será analizado para evitar un aumento excesivo, especialmente para los hogares. La operación reforzada, que implicó medidas extraordinarias de seguridad y ajuste, ha representado entre mayo y octubre de 2025 un porcentaje significativo de los costes operativos del sistema. Por otro lado, la orden también aborda la retribución gasista, apostando por la eficiencia y la prolongación de la vida útil de las instalaciones existentes en un contexto de reducción de la demanda de combustibles fósiles.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-autoriza-incluir-el-sobrecoste-de-la-operacion-de-ree-en-la-factura-electrica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-autoriza-incluir-el-sobrecoste-de-la-operacion-de-ree-en-la-factura-electrica</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iberia suspende temporalmente sus vuelos comerciales a Venezuela por motivos de seguridad]]></title><description><![CDATA[Iberia ha decidido cancelar sus vuelos comerciales a Venezuela debido a la situación de seguridad y el aumento de la actividad militar en la región, que la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA) de Estados Unidos ha calificado de potencialmente peligrosa.

Busquets, que había visitado un mural de Joan Miró en la UNESCO en París, intentó incluir también a Miró en el proyecto, pero Picasso, tras varios viajes y convencimiento, decidió hacerse con el encargo completo y añadió una estrella mironiana a un mural, evitando que Miró participara directamente. Picasso prefirió realizar su obra mediante esgrafiado sobre hormigón, con la colaboración técnica del artista noruego Carl Nesjar. La historia refleja las complejas relaciones artísticas y políticas de la época, dado el pasado militar de Busquets y la trascendencia artística de Picasso, autor del 'Guernica'. Además, se expone la importancia histórica y arquitectónica del edificio, la evolución del uso del hormigón en Cataluña, y se señala la proximidad de esta obra a otras relevantes como la editor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encargo-de-picasso-para-el-col-legi-d-arquitectes-de-catalunya-y-su-relacion-con-miro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encargo-de-picasso-para-el-col-legi-d-arquitectes-de-catalunya-y-su-relacion-con-miro</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 23:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Victoria Rosell expresa su preocupación por la condena al fiscal general del Estado y defiende la presunción de inocencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La magistrada Victoria Rosell ha manifestado su profunda preocupación por la reciente condena al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, por un caso de revelación de datos reservados.

Esta red articula mensajes que minimizan la violencia de género, niegan la desigualdad estructural y promueven mitos como el de las denuncias falsas. Según Linares, estas ideas buscan frenar los avances feministas y refuerzan roles patriarcales que perpetúan la discriminación. En la 'manosfera' conviven grupos muy distintos, como los 'incel', que culpan a las mujeres de su falta de éxito sexual; los 'coach' machistas que enseñan a ligar desde el desprecio; y los 'gym-bros', que glorifican una masculinidad agresiva vinculada al cuerpo y la fuerza física. Internet y los algoritmos favorecen que estos discursos se amplifiquen y se normalicen, generando una radicalización preocupante, sobre todo entre adolescentes.

Blas Martín, dueño de un taller de carpintería metálica en Granada, explica que muchos jóvenes rechazan trabajos bien remunerados, como el suyo, con sueldos iniciales de 1.200 euros, pero con perspectivas de aumento a medio plazo. A pesar de ofrecer mejores condiciones que otros sectores, los altos costes de contratación y la falta de formación práctica impiden a los talleres contratar aprendices. Blas también denuncia que los cursos de soldadura no proporcionan la experiencia necesaria, lo que genera un vacío de trabajadores cualificados en el sector. Los talleres, en consecuencia, se ven obligados a contratar personal experimentado, lo que dificulta aún más la entrada de jóvenes a estos oficios. El problema, aunque parte de una tendencia global, refleja la desmotivación de muchos jóvenes hacia los trabajos manuales, a pesar de que ofrecen salarios competitivos y horarios raz]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-relevo-generacional-en-los-oficios-manuales-y-sus-consecuencias-en-los-talleres</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-relevo-generacional-en-los-oficios-manuales-y-sus-consecuencias-en-los-talleres</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 19:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[María Guardiola contrata a su primo como chófer oficial inmediatamente después de asumir el cargo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de la Junta de Extremadura, María Guardiola, criticó al candidato socialista Miguel Ángel Gallardo por supuestos casos de nepotismo dentro de su partido. Sin embargo, documentos oficiales revelan que Guardiola contrató a su primo, Daniel Ollero Quintero, como su chófer oficial apenas una semana después de tomar posesión el 17 de julio de 2023. Ollero, que antes regentaba una churrería, recibe un salario anual de 34.735,40 euros. Este hecho contradice las críticas públicas de Guardiola hacia Gallardo y ha generado polémica en Extremadura. De cara a las elecciones autonómicas, Guardiola también ha renovado más de la mitad de las candidaturas del PP en la región, incorporando perfiles externos y ajenos a la militancia tradicional, lo que ha provocado críticas internas por falta de rigor y desorganización.

La persona fallecida era de edad avanzada y presentaba problemas de salud previos. Se encontró una pequeña bandada de aves de corral en el patio trasero del hogar del paciente, lo que sugiere el origen del contagio. Hasta la fecha, la mayoría de los casos humanos en EE.UU. estaban asociados a la cepa H5N1, de la cual se han registrado aproximadamente 70 infecciones humanas en el último año y medio. Las autoridades sanitarias destacan que el riesgo para la comunidad general es bajo, no encontrándose indicios de transmisión entre humanos ni casos positivos entre contactos cercanos.

Ambos monarcas compartieron una amistad cercana que se consolidó a través de la crisis del Sahara Occidental, un conflicto que marcó el fin de la presencia española en el territorio. A pesar de la versión oficial de Juan Carlos I, que se presenta como un líder que evitó una guerra innecesaria, expertos como Charles Powell y Ali Lmrabet consideran que el rey emérito jugó un papel crucial en la entrega del Sahara a Marruecos, algo que él mismo reconoció como uno de los momentos más amargos de su reinado. La relación entre ambos no estuvo exenta de tensiones, pero permitió mantener una estabilidad política en las relaciones bilaterales entre España y Marruecos. Esta amistad se extendió hasta los últimos momentos de la vida de Hasán II, quien murió en 1999, dejando una imagen de cercanía y respeto mutuo entre los dos reyes]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-compleja-relacion-entre-juan-carlos-i-y-hasan-ii-de-la-marcha-verde-a-la-entrega-del-sahara</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-compleja-relacion-entre-juan-carlos-i-y-hasan-ii-de-la-marcha-verde-a-la-entrega-del-sahara</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tomasa, una jubilada madrileña que comparte piso para llegar a fin de mes con una pensión de 650 euros]]></title><description><![CDATA[La historia de Tomasa, una mujer de 70 años residente en Móstoles, refleja la precariedad que viven muchos jubilados en España ante el aumento del coste de la vivienda y las pensiones insuficientes.

Pese a las dificultades, Tomasa afronta su situación con humor y optimismo. Se las ingenia para ahorrar —comprando en los lugares más baratos o rebajando la leche con agua— y colabora como voluntaria en la asociación Akumafu de Fuenlabrada, donde limpia y ayuda en el bar a cambio de compañía y la posibilidad de tomarse un café.

Durante su mandato, caracterizado por un fuerte culto a la personalidad y un ambiente de represión, contar chistes sobre Franco era una forma de resistencia política y una válvula de escape, aunque con riesgos evidentes, pues algunos acabaron en comisaría. Se relata cómo estos chistes formaban parte del folclore del régimen y cómo incluso algunas personas cercanas a Franco le contaban chistes sobre él. El artículo recopila varios ejemplos de estos chistes, muchos de ellos con un humor negro característico, que abordan desde aspectos políticos y sociales de la época hasta anécdotas sobre la personalidad y la edad avanzada de Franco. También se menciona la vigilancia estricta de la imagen pública del dictador y la propaganda oficial que lo rodeaba.

Chicharro, en un programa de la cadena Arte, afirmó que Franco no cometió crímenes y defendió la 'justicia' de las ejecuciones. Además, alegó que en España hoy existe una 'dictadura del pensamiento único', aludiendo a la Ley de Memoria Democrática.

El 28 de octubre de 2025, una misión de cazahuracanes registró una ráfaga de 405 km/h en el interior del ciclón, antes de que llegara a Jamaica. Esta velocidad, equivalente a unas 252 millas por hora, supera el récord previo fijado por el tifón Megi en 2010. El dato fue verificado por el Centro Nacional para la Investigación Atmosférica (NCAR) tras múltiples comprobaciones instrumentales y de coherencia del viento, confirmándose como la ráfaga más intensa medida por avión en el Atlántico. Melissa se desarrolló en un entorno especialmente favorable: aguas del Caribe con temperaturas anómalamente altas, una cizalladura vertical del viento muy baja y una atmósfera saturada de humedad. Estas condiciones permitieron una intensificación explosiva en pocas horas, con un pequeño ojo de apenas 15 km de diámetro que potenció la concentración de vientos extremos. Aunque la ráfaga récord no tocó tierra, el fenó]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-huracan-melissa-bate-el-record-de-rafagas-de-viento-en-el-caribe-con-405-km-h</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-huracan-melissa-bate-el-record-de-rafagas-de-viento-en-el-caribe-con-405-km-h</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Predominio conservador en la Sala de lo Penal del Supremo marca sentencias contra la izquierda y independentistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Sala de lo Penal del Tribunal Supremo de España, encargada de juzgar casos de corrupción política, ha estado bajo control mayoritario conservador durante 20 años desde la llegada del Partido Popular al Gobierno en 1996. Esta mayoría ha condicionado decisiones en asuntos políticos sensibles, manifestándose en sentencias divididas donde magistrados progresistas y conservadores discrepan. Casos emblemáticos incluyen el veto a la amnistía para líderes independentistas como Carles Puigdemont y Oriol Junqueras, la imputación temporal de terrorismo contra Puigdemont, sentencias de condena en casos de corrupción como los ERE contra José Antonio Griñán y la condena al diputado Alberto Rodríguez, que derivó en la pérdida de su escaño. La presencia de una mayoría conservadora ha generado cuestionamientos sobre la imparcialidad del tribunal y ha causado votos particulares que reflejan divergencias políticas. Esta situación persiste a pesar de que el PSOE ha gobernado varios años en España, y la]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/predominio-conservador-en-la-sala-de-lo-penal-del-supremo-marca-sentencias-contra-la-izquierda-y-independentistas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/predominio-conservador-en-la-sala-de-lo-penal-del-supremo-marca-sentencias-contra-la-izquierda-y-independentistas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crítica a la condena al Fiscal General sin pruebas en el aniversario de la muerte de Franco]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia denuncia una condena judicial al Fiscal General del Estado basada en acusaciones sin pruebas, coincidiendo con el 50 aniversario de la muerte del dictador Francisco Franco. Según el autor, esta condena es un golpe a la democracia española orquestado por una mayoría conservadora del Tribunal Supremo, bajo influencia del PP y FAES, para proteger intereses políticos y mantener el poder. Se critica que la sentencia impone inhabilitación, multa y una indemnización al novio de la presidenta Ayuso, en un contexto en el que supuestamente se utiliza el poder judicial y mediático para neutralizar a la oposición y perpetuar estructuras de poder conservadoras.

Trump, de 79 años, elogió a Mamdani y expresó optimismo sobre el encuentro, afirmando que fue “una reunión excelente” y “muy productiva”. A pesar de haber tildado a Mamdani de “comunista lunático” y de haber hecho amenazas pasadas relacionadas con la ciudad, Trump reconoció similitudes en ciertas posiciones y dijo que podrían llevarse bien. Mamdani, de 34 años y representante de la izquierda democrática, había mostrado una postura firme durante la campaña, prometiendo trabajar para beneficiar a los casi ocho millones de habitantes de la ciudad. Durante la cita, Trump afirmó que esperaba que la sesión fuera “bastante civil” y, al ser preguntado sobre la posibilidad de abrirla a la prensa, respondió de forma positiva.

Szijjarto subrayó que Hungría no apoyará la decisión de enviar otros 100.000 millones de euros a Ucrania mientras esté en el gobierno. Este rechazo se produce tras la reciente detención de varios funcionarios y empresarios ucranianos involucrados en una red de sobornos en el sector energético, destapada por la Oficina Nacional Anticorrupción de Ucrania (NABU). Entre los hallazgos más sorprendentes, se encontraron imágenes de bolsas llenas de dinero y un inodoro de oro en la vivienda de uno de los aliados cercanos de Zelenski.

Este accidente se produce apenas ocho meses después de otro fatal siniestro en Cerredo, donde perdieron la vida cinco trabajadores por una explosión de gas grisú. La mina donde ocurrió este nuevo desastre, gestionada por la empresa TYC Narcea, fue inspeccionada recientemente, pero las causas del derrumbe todavía están bajo investigación.

Esta declaración contradice comunicados previos del propio Caputo antes de las últimas elecciones legislativas, cuando había mencionado negociaciones avanzadas en torno a un préstamo similar. Además, Caputo hizo referencia a un préstamo corto denominado REPO por 5.000 millones de dólares relacionado con vencimientos próximos en enero, sin embargo, no confirmó su relación con el rescate financiero mencionado. La noticia incluye también las críticas de Caputo a un tuit del periodista Eduardo Feinmann, en el que se detallaba la existencia del rescate por 5.000 millones.

Este mineral tiene unos 550 millones de años y se formó en un fondo marino poco profundo durante el Periodo Cámbrico, cuando el agua se evaporaba dejando depósitos de cloruro sódico y otros minerales. El choque tectónico de hace 80 millones de años entre la placa India y Euroasiática hizo que estos depósitos ascendieran formando domos salinos, los cuales se parecen a gotas de agua invertidas y poseen una gran plasticidad que facilita el plegamiento de las rocas circundantes. La coloración rosada característica de esta sal se debe a la presencia minoritaria de magnesio y óxidos de hierro, aunque esta coloración no es exclusiva de Pakistán y ocurre en muchas sales naturales. Aunque el marketing ha popularizado esta sal como única por su antigüedad y color, geológicamente su sabor y propiedades son equivalentes ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historia y evolución del primer buque petrolero moderno: El Gluckauf]]></title><description><![CDATA[La década de 1877 a 1886 marcó un hito en el transporte marítimo de petróleo con el desarrollo del primer buque petrolero moderno, resultante de la iniciativa de los hermanos Nobel en Azerbaiyán y el ingeniero naval Henry F. Swan en Reino Unido. El principal reto fue el transporte seguro y eficiente del petróleo a granel por mar, reemplazando los toneles que causaban pérdidas significativas. El primer prototipo fue el Zoroaster en 1878, seguido por innovaciones en diseño y seguridad para petroleros mayores. El Gluckauf, botado en 1886 y diseñado para cruzar el Atlántico, introdujo sistemas únicos como válvulas de carga operables desde la cubierta y divisiones interiores para estabilidad. Demostró ser revolucionario pese a la resistencia de estibadores y fabricantes de barriles en EE.UU., estableciendo un nuevo estándar en el transporte del 'oro negro'. Su servicio fue fundamental para la caída del precio del petróleo en Europa y sentó un precedente que a día de hoy mantiene el transpor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/historia-y-evolucion-del-primer-buque-petrolero-moderno-el-gluckauf</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/historia-y-evolucion-del-primer-buque-petrolero-moderno-el-gluckauf</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 10:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Podemos denuncia la prescripción de multas de aparcamiento de responsables políticos en Siero]]></title><description><![CDATA[Podemos ha denunciado que el alcalde de Siero, Ángel García, y la concejala de La Fresneda, Alejandra Cuadriello, no fueron sancionados por sus respectivas multas de aparcamiento, ya que los procedimientos prescribieron antes de ser gestionados.

Además, critican la escasez de recursos en el municipio para tramitar adecuadamente las sanciones, lo que genera una gestión ineficaz. La edil de Podemos, Silvia Tárano, también ha expresado su preocupación por la situación en la que, en medio de la polémica, el alcalde está impulsando cambios en la Policía Local.
