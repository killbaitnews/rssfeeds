The materials include internal emails, strategy presentations, expert reports, and executive depositions from Meta, Google/YouTube, Snap, and TikTok. Collectively, the documents indicate that attracting and retaining children and teenagers was a central business objective for these companies, even as internal research acknowledged risks to youth mental health, learning, sleep, and overall well-being.

According to the report, Meta documents describe coordinated strategies to grow teen usage through school-based tactics, ambassador programs, and product features designed to increase habitual engagement. Internal discussions acknowledged correlations between platform use and lower well-being among teens, while still emphasizing the long-term financial value of acquiring users at very young ages.

The presentation highlighted tangible progress that makes the system more usable and relevant than in previous years, particularly in areas where Hurd has historically lagged behind Linux and other modern kernels.

One of the most notable achievements is the near-completion of the x86_64 port. For many years, GNU Hurd was largely limited to 32-bit x86 systems, which severely constrained its practicality on modern hardware. With 64-bit support now essentially complete, Hurd can better target contemporary PCs and servers. In addition, there are early discussions and interest in extending support to AArch64, which would further broaden its hardware reach.

Another critical area of improvement is symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). Hurd has traditionally struggled to effecti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gnu-hurd-makes-significant-progress-in-2026-with-64-bit-support-smp-improvements-and-growing-debian-compatibility</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gnu-hurd-makes-significant-progress-in-2026-with-64-bit-support-smp-improvements-and-growing-debian-compatibility</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 21:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Candace Cameron Bure Affirms Ongoing Support for Lori Loughlin Amid Separation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Candace Cameron Bure, best known for her role in Full House, has publicly affirmed her continued friendship and support for Lori Loughlin during a challenging period in Loughlin's personal life. Loughlin, 61, is reportedly navigating a separation from her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, after nearly 28 years of marriage. The couple, who share two daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose, had faced legal issues following the 2019 college admissions scandal, which saw Loughlin serve two months in prison and Giannulli five. Sources suggest that the couple's relationship never fully recovered after the legal fallout, and they are now living separate lives with distinct emotional states. During this time, Bure has remained a steadfast friend, staying in touch and offering both private and public support, referring to Loughlin as 'family.' Bure emphasized at the 33rd Annual Movieguide Faith & Values Awards Gala that she is always there for her longtime friend.

According to the report, starting on February 10, 2026, eligible cardmembers—including those with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred, Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business, and J.P. Morgan Reserve—will be able to directly buy tickets through a special access link. This offer is notable because it is not a lottery-based system; instead, tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last.

The ticket sales window is expected to run from February 10 through February 24, 2026, though availability may end earlier due to limited inventory. Only Category 1 and Category 2 seats will be offered, which historically have been among the most expensive options. With FIFA’s use of dynamic pricing, prices are expected to reflect market demand rather than discounted or fixed rates.

Amazon saw its valuation drop by $200 billion in a single session, with shares falling more than 9%. Microsoft suffered its largest one-day decline in over five years, losing roughly $357 billion after announcing record AI investments alongside slower growth in its cloud business. Similarly, Alphabet and Nvidia each lost over $100 billion in market capitalization, reflecting concerns about whether the massive AI spending will translate into profits. Despite these setbacks, investments in AI are projected to increase by 50% this year. Analysts warn that while AI has potential, the enormous capital expenditures required for building large data centers and integrating AI into products create significant financial risks. The developments underscore growing market skepticism about the profitability of AI-focused vent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/major-tech-stocks-decline-amid-rising-ai-investment-costs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/major-tech-stocks-decline-amid-rising-ai-investment-costs</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Voter Expresses Regret Over Support Amid Controversies and Policy Criticism]]></title><description><![CDATA[As dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump grows, some of his supporters are publicly expressing regret. One voter from New Mexico, identified only as 'John,' called C-SPAN's 'Washington Journal' to apologize for supporting Trump in three consecutive elections. He criticized the president for posting a racist video on Truth Social featuring former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, calling it embarrassing and dishonorable. John also condemned Trump's relationships with corporate leaders, alleged corruption, and harsh immigration enforcement policies, including raids targeting children and schools. Public frustration with Trump extends beyond isolated incidents, reflected in polling showing Americans are unhappy with his authoritarian tendencies, handling of the economy, and focus on conspiracy theories rather than domestic issues. Recent political events, such as a Democrat winning a deep-red Texas Senate seat previously endorsed by Trump, highlight growing Republican conce]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-voter-expresses-regret-over-support-amid-controversies-and-policy-criticism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-voter-expresses-regret-over-support-amid-controversies-and-policy-criticism</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 16:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Travelers Are Earning American Airlines Status and Navigating Credit Card Changes in 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[This Week in Review from Frequent Miler focuses on how loyalty programs and credit card strategies are evolving in 2026, with particular attention to American Airlines AAdvantage. The article opens with a discussion of modern “mileage running,” explaining how elite status can now be earned without flying. Since American Airlines awards Loyalty Points for credit card spending, shopping portals, hotel bookings, and other partnerships, travelers close to an elite threshold can finish qualifying from home. The author describes using AAdvantage Shopping and tax payments on credit cards to bridge the gap between Gold and Platinum status, while also clarifying timing rules around February transactions and statement closing dates.

A major theme is the upcoming transition of Barclays-issued American Airlines Aviator cards to Citi American Airlines cards in April 2026.

Rather than focusing on travel rewards or credit cards, the piece curates stories that are striking, ironic, or emotionally compelling.

The first story centers on a large-scale fraud involving helicopter rescue operations in Nepal. Because trekking at high altitudes is dangerous, hikers are typically required to have insurance that covers emergency rescues, which are common and extremely costly. According to the article, several travel and rescue executives allegedly exploited this system by submitting fabricated rescue claims. These claims reportedly included fake hospital documents, medical invoices, and cargo manifests. Authorities arrested six executives, with one company accused of filing 171 fraudulent claims out of more than 1,200 submissions, leading to over $10 million in illegitimate insurance payouts.

In a recent episode of her podcast, Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky, she spoke with actress Jameela Jamil about the lingering fear and anxiety stemming from the intense public scrutiny she experienced. Lewinsky explained that although she has made progress in healing and has become more confident in her identity, the fear of losing everything she has built remains a constant presence. She described moments of vulnerability, feeling as though the trauma from the past could resurface at any time and threaten her sense of purpose and stability. Despite these challenges, Lewinsky emphasized her efforts to stay grounded in the present and focus on what she has now rather than what happened decades ago. The conversation highlighted not only the personal struggle Lewinsky has faced but also the resilience required to navigate]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-lewinsky-reflects-on-the-lasting-emotional-impact-of-the-1998-clinton-scandal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-lewinsky-reflects-on-the-lasting-emotional-impact-of-the-1998-clinton-scandal</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Trade Deficit and the Impact of Tariffs on Imports]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses recent trends in the U.S. trade deficit, illustrated with graphs from WolfStreet. It highlights that the temporary spike in the deficit was largely due to U.S. importers stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. While the tariffs have indeed discouraged imports, the article argues that a significant portion of the adjustment in the trade balance, particularly with Europe, is influenced by broader geopolitical events. The post controversially suggests that the war in Ukraine has had economic repercussions that affected trade flows. The author briefly notes personal engagement with a small online group but does not elaborate further. Overall, the article provides an economic commentary linking U.S. trade policy, import behavior, and international relations, without delving into in-depth statistical analysis or offering comprehensive policy evaluation.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-trade-deficit-and-the-impact-of-tariffs-on-imports</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-trade-deficit-and-the-impact-of-tariffs-on-imports</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[State-Supported Displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank Intensifies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the past several years, the forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank has intensified dramatically, evolving from sporadic settler encroachment into a coordinated, state-backed campaign. The Naasan family exemplifies this crisis: they have been forcibly uprooted twice from their ancestral lands in the Jordan Valley due to violent attacks by Israeli settlers and military forces. Settler raids, home demolitions, and systemic harassment continue to target Palestinian communities, particularly Bedouin villages in Area C, leading to widespread displacement. Since October 2023, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been internally displaced, including over 30,000 from refugee camps during large-scale military operations. The displacement is accompanied by property destruction, killing of livestock, and direct threats to civilians. Experts describe these actions as deliberate demographic engineering, supported by Israeli government funding and quasi-governmental organizations]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/state-supported-displacement-of-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-intensifies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/state-supported-displacement-of-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-intensifies</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Overview of French Comics Artist Serge Pellé and His Science Fiction Work on Orbital]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article from the Lines and Colors blog presents an overview of the work of French comics artist Serge Pellé, best known for his contributions to the science fiction comic series 'Orbital,' created in collaboration with writer Sylvain Runberg. The post situates Pellé within the contemporary European comics scene, emphasizing his distinctive visual style and his ability to construct dramatic, immersive futuristic environments.

Pellé’s artwork is characterized by expansive science fiction settings rendered with deep perspective and a high level of architectural and mechanical detail. The article highlights his talent for depicting large-scale futuristic structures, imaginative spacecraft, and alien creatures, all enhanced by intense lighting and dynamic compositions. These elements combine to create scenes that feel cinematic and atmospheric, reinforcing the narrative tension of the Orbital series.

The burial pit was found just south of the Iron Age hillfort at Wandlebury and contains the remains of up to ten young men. The site is located in what was once a volatile frontier zone between the Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia, an area frequently contested during the early Viking presence in England.

The grave is striking for the chaotic and violent nature of the burial. It includes at least four complete skeletons that appear to have been bound at the time of burial, with dismembered body parts—such as stacked legs, scattered limbs, and a pile of skulls—thrown on top of them. While only limited evidence of combat injuries has been identified, including a single skull with chop marks consistent with decapitation, the overall arrangement suggests extreme viole]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 06:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Offers Two Free Games This Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epic Games Store continues its tradition of offering free games to its users, doubling the number of free titles compared to the previous week. From February 5 to February 12, 2026, players can claim two new free games that will permanently belong to their accounts once registered.

Relations between South Africa and Washington have cooled due to political disagreements, South Africa’s positions on sensitive international issues, and its participation in alliances such as BRICS, which challenge U.S. global influence. As a result, the United States has threatened South Africa’s trade privileges and imposed tariffs on key exports, negatively affecting an economy already vulnerable to global instability.

In response, South Africa has accelerated a strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the U.S. market while diversifying its trade partnerships. China has emerged as a central player in this shift. Beijing has decided to grant tariff-free access to specific South African products, offering immediate relief to exporters harmed by U.S. tariffs.

U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns had initially blocked her deportation and recommended that she be issued a student visa to return to the U.S. However, federal prosecutors argue that the Secretary of State does not have the legal authority to grant visas unilaterally. The government further noted that if Lopez Belloza returned, she would still be subject to immediate detention and removal under a final deportation order. ICE confirmed that while they considered returning her to the status quo prior to her removal, they have decided against it. Lopez Belloza, who had no criminal record, expressed that her deportation felt unjust, as she had been focused on her studies and had secured significant financial aid to attend college.

As a result, the underlying reporting must be understood in general terms based on the article’s headline and its broader public context.

From the title, the article appears to address renewed scrutiny surrounding the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and how alleged associations, documents, or revelations connected to him may have political consequences in the United Kingdom. Specifically, it suggests that the controversy could pose a serious threat to the sitting UK prime minister, either by damaging public trust, intensifying political opposition, or triggering internal party unrest.

The collection imagines cities and everyday objects overtaken by botanical growth, creating visually striking scenarios where flowers reclaim asphalt, steel, and architecture. In pieces like 'Going Green,' a sports car in the desert evolves into a miniature ecosystem, while 'Brooklyn Brownstone' reimagines New York’s facades as vertical gardens with climbing vines and blooming morning glories. 'Angels Gate' incorporates a basketball court into this botanical transformation, merging rigid geometry with organic forms. The series also references art history, as seen in a floral reinterpretation of Vermeer’s 'Girl with a Pearl Earring,' where petals replace paint to suggest the freedom of imagination beyond historical constraints.

Despite their divorce in 2022, Kardashian emphasized that they remain committed co-parents to their four children: North, 12, Saint, 10, Chicago, 8, and Psalm, 6.

The one-minute clip, posted on Thursday evening, primarily focused on repeating false claims about alleged irregularities in the 2020 presidential election, particularly questioning President Joe Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania. Near the end of the video, at the 59-second mark, an AI-generated image appeared showing Barack Obama’s face superimposed on a monkey’s body, accompanied by the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

This development comes after months of escalating trade tensions, where U.S. punitive tariffs were imposed to pressure India into aligning its energy policy with American priorities. By agreeing to redirect its energy imports to other countries, particularly the U.S. and Venezuela, India has shifted from its longstanding strategy of diversified energy sourcing and cost prioritization. The move highlights the influence of economic leverage in international relations, signaling that access to major markets often requires political concessions. While India maintains some strategic autonomy, the decision underscores the limits of neutrality when faced with the economic power of a global hegemon. For emerging economies, this case demonstrates that maintaining a neutral position in global energy politics can come with high costs and strategic constrain]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 20:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical Continuity of State-Sanctioned Violence from the KKK to ICE]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article draws a historical parallel between the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), framing both as instruments of state terror designed to divide and control the working class. The KKK emerged after the U.S. Civil War to maintain white supremacy and social order through terror, targeting Black citizens and preventing interracial labor solidarity. The article argues that the KKK’s racial violence was not mere fanaticism but a calculated political tool tolerated or supported by authorities, evolving over time from clandestine operations to infiltrating government structures. ICE, created in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, is portrayed as a modern continuation of this model, enforcing xenophobic and anti-labor policies under legal authority. Through practices such as dawn raids, arbitrary arrests, family separations, and detention centers, ICE creates a climate of fear aimed at disciplining the broader U.S. working class.

Its standout feature is an exceptionally strong welcome offer: 100,000 Atmos points plus a 25,000-point Global Companion Award after $6,000 in spend within 90 days. Given an estimated average value of 1.5 cents per point, the welcome bonus alone can be worth roughly $1,875 if fully optimized.

The card earns 3x points on Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, dining, and foreign purchases, with 1x on all other spending. It also provides a 10% bonus on earned points for cardholders with eligible Bank of America accounts. Unique benefits include annual Global Companion Awards, which act as discounts on the second passenger’s award ticket, and an additional 100,000-point companion award after $60,000 in annual spend.

Contrary to the simplified narratives often presented in popular culture, the story reveals the complex and uncomfortable realities of power, oppression, and survival in the American South. During the early nineteenth century, several Native American nations of the Southeast, including the Cherokee, adopted aspects of European-American culture in an effort to avoid displacement. This process of so-called “civilization” included plantation agriculture and the enslavement of Black people.

After the forced removal known as the Trail of Tears, wealthy Cherokee elites rebuilt their plantation economy in Indian Territory, bringing enslaved people with them. One of the most prominent figures was Joseph “Rich Joe” Vann, a powerful leader and businessman whose wealth depended on enslaved la]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-1842-revolt-of-enslaved-african-americans-in-cherokee-territory</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-1842-revolt-of-enslaved-african-americans-in-cherokee-territory</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 19:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU prepares framework allowing US access to biometric data for visa-free travel agreements]]></title><description><![CDATA[European Union member states are preparing to grant the United States access to national biometric databases containing sensitive personal data, including fingerprints and facial scans, as part of efforts to preserve visa-free travel for EU citizens. Washington has demanded such access since 2022 under what it calls Enhanced Border Security Partnerships (EBSP), linking data-sharing arrangements to continued participation in the US Visa Waiver Program. While most EU countries are affected, Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus are already excluded from visa-free travel, and Denmark and Ireland will not be bound by the EU framework due to legal opt-outs.

It references statements made over 20 years ago by climatologist Mojib Latif, who predicted that Germany would no longer experience harsh winters due to global warming, noting that recent severe winter conditions contradict those predictions. The text criticizes climate models like ERA5 and datasets such as HadCRUT for relying on indirect measurements and statistical estimations rather than actual, continuous temperature recordings. The author argues that temperature databases are adjusted over time, sometimes retroactively, to fit prevailing climate narratives, highlighting past controversies including the 2009 East Anglia emails that suggested manipulation of climate records.

Speaking at a conference at Ottawa’s Rideau Club, Eyre argued that Canada would never achieve true strategic independence without its own nuclear deterrent. He claimed that Canada possesses many of the prerequisites for such a program, including a strong civilian nuclear industry, scientific expertise, and significant uranium reserves, which rank among the largest in the world.

Eyre emphasized that he was not necessarily calling for the immediate development of nuclear weapons, but rather for keeping all strategic options open. He suggested investing in delivery technologies, particularly in aerospace and missile capabilities, so that Canada could act quickly if future circumstances demanded it. According to Eyre, these steps would provide strategic coverage in an increasingly unstable global environment.

Montreal boasts around 70 international organizations, including six UN offices and NATO’s Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence, as well as significant experience in aerospace, finance, defense, and technology sectors.

This offer was especially valuable, prompting many cardholders to plan significant spending as soon as their cards became active.

However, reports surfaced indicating that the 5x promotion was not properly attached to all accounts that cardholders believed were eligible.

Instead of traditional in-ear earbuds, Slac consists of a circular ear ring paired with a wrist component, both of which resemble contemporary jewelry more than audio devices. The ear ring wraps gently around the ear without entering the ear canal, allowing users to remain aware of conversations, traffic, and environmental sounds while listening to music or other audio content.

A key feature of the design is its modular, case-free approach. When not in use, the ear ring magnetically attaches to the wrist piece, transforming into a bracelet-like form. This eliminates the need for a separate charging or storage case and reinforces the idea that the product is meant to be worn continuously, like jewelry. The aesthetic is deliberate and sculptural, with black and metallic finishes that give the device enough visual ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/samsung-slac-concept-reimagines-earbuds-as-wearable-jewelry</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/samsung-slac-concept-reimagines-earbuds-as-wearable-jewelry</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[New DOJ records raise unresolved questions about activity near Jeffrey Epstein’s jail cell before his death]]></title><description><![CDATA[Newly released Department of Justice documents have revived questions about the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s death in a federal jail in August 2019, focusing on unexplained activity near his cell hours before he was found dead. Surveillance video logs reviewed by investigators describe an orange-colored figure ascending the staircase to Epstein’s isolated housing tier at approximately 10:39 p.m. the night before his body was discovered. This observation appears to contradict repeated official statements that no one entered the tier that night.

The records show that different investigative bodies interpreted the same blurry video footage in conflicting ways. FBI reviewers suggested the figure could have been an inmate wearing an orange prison uniform, while the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General concluded it was an unidentified corrections officer possibly carrying orange linen or bedding.

Unlike many video game adaptations that retell existing stories, the Baldur’s Gate series will serve as a direct continuation of the game’s narrative, taking place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3. The story will explore the consequences of the game’s ending while introducing new protagonists who must navigate a world shaped by the actions of powerful, established characters.

The series is being produced in collaboration with Hasbro Entertainment, with additional executive producers including Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O’Connor, and Hasbro’s Gabriel Marano.

These cardholders were told that their cards would remain with Barclays instead of transferring to Citi.

Because Barclays will no longer be permitted to issue American Airlines–branded cards, affected accounts will be product-changed into other Barclays cards.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on social media that the group has 'lost its way' since its 2025 rebrand to promote inclusivity, deviating from 'core values' aligned with 'God and country.'

Unlike conventional bridges where roads go over water, this aqueduct allows a road to pass underneath a waterway. Boats can travel smoothly across the shallow channel on top while cars drive below without interruption. This design eliminates the need for drawbridges, tall structures, or any waiting times for passing vessels, creating a seamless flow of both road and water traffic. The structure highlights a minimalist and efficient engineering approach, characteristic of Dutch design thinking, where water is integrated into infrastructure rather than treated as an obstacle. Its clever design initially causes a mental double-take, as viewers instinctively perceive water above a road as impossible. Yet, this innovative solution demonstrates practicality, reduced mechanical complexity, and a visually clean environment.

CEO Mike Stanton warned that allowing Chinese vehicles could be detrimental to the U.S. automotive industry, consumers, and the country’s economic interests. While some members of Congress, such as Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, reportedly support resisting Chinese imports, there is bipartisan acknowledgment of the challenges posed by the direct-to-consumer sales model favored by Chinese manufacturers.

The discussion breaks down key aspects such as earning rates on everyday spending, standard airline perks like free checked bags and priority boarding, and whether those benefits meaningfully offset the annual fee. A significant portion of the episode is dedicated to lounge access policies, elite-status-related perks, and how each card supports travelers who are chasing or maintaining airline status.

At the same time, it acknowledges that alternative explanations exist, with some outlets suggesting the satellite may have broken apart due to an accidental collision with space debris rather than a deliberate military strike.

The Olymp/Luch satellites, launched beginning in 2014, have long drawn attention from Western governments because of what they describe as unusual behavior.

This approach, the article argues, makes a genuine peace agreement impossible and instead serves a political objective: prolonging the conflict while portraying Russia as inherently hostile to peace.

A central argument is that European and US proposals assume from the outset that Russia would violate any future agreement. On that basis, Western actors emphasize the need for so-called security guarantees for Ukraine.

However, critics argue the measure is largely ineffective and poses serious risks to privacy and civil liberties. Social media companies prioritize advertising revenue over user well-being, designing platforms to maximize engagement, often to the detriment of mental health. Measures like hiding 'likes' could reduce harm without restricting access, but governments often avoid these less disruptive alternatives due to economic interests. Prohibiting access entirely can hinder freedom of expression, access to information, and social development, especially for marginalized groups or individuals with dissident sexual and gender identities.

The attacker fired multiple shots at Alexeiev's back. He was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery and remains in a coma. Alexeiev, of Ukrainian origin, is the deputy director of Russia's military intelligence agency, GRU, oversees the country's private military companies, and was involved in negotiations during the Wagner Group mutiny in 2023. He is also under U.S. and U.K. sanctions for alleged involvement in election interference and the 2018 Salisbury poisoning incident.

The key change is an increase in the minimum spending requirement to earn the signup bonus, rising 50% from $8,000 to $12,000 within the first 6 months. The bonus itself remains unchanged at as high as 175,000 Membership Rewards points, though actual offers vary by applicant and are only revealed after applying. This adjustment marks a notable shift, as it is uncommon for issuers to raise spend thresholds without boosting the points awarded. The article highlights that this makes the offer less appealing psychologically, especially compared to competitors like the Citi Strata Elite and Chase Sapphire Reserve, which require $6,000 in just three months. Despite the change, the Platinum Card retains strong first-year value due to its extensive perks, including up to $200 airline incidental credits, $200 Uber credits, $100 Saks credits, $600 Fine Hotels & Resorts credits]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/american-express-increases-minimum-spend-requirement-for-platinum-card-welcome-bonus-to-12-000</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/american-express-increases-minimum-spend-requirement-for-platinum-card-welcome-bonus-to-12-000</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 20:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Messages reveal Steve Bannon’s attempts to seek funding support for European far-right parties]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently released documents from the so-called Epstein files reveal extensive communications between Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump, and financier Jeffrey Epstein, highlighting Bannon’s attempts to influence European politics between 2018 and 2019. The messages show Bannon seeking support and potential funding to strengthen far-right and Eurosceptic parties ahead of the 2019 European parliamentary elections. His efforts focused on building a coordinated nationalist bloc within the European parliament, involving parties and figures from Italy, France, Germany, and several other European countries.

Bannon expressed particular interest in Italy’s Matteo Salvini, then deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party, as well as France’s Marine Le Pen. In one message dated March 2019, Bannon told Epstein he was focused on raising money to ensure both leaders could run full electoral slates.

The incident involved a Dongfeng eπ007 electric car that crashed in Wenshan, Yunnan province, on March 19, 2025, following a high-speed collision with a truck. Although the crash itself did not initially appear severe, the vehicle’s battery was apparently punctured, triggering a fire less than a minute after impact.

The video shows the driver exiting the car quickly but being unable to open the rear door because the retractable door handles failed to deploy. Moments later, even the driver’s own door became inoperable. Within 29 seconds, smoke filled the cabin, trapping three passengers inside as all doors remained shut. With time running out, the driver attempted to break the window using his elbow, while a bystander rushed in to help.

Rather than a true transfer, the promotion functions as a simple mileage match with no additional requirements, making it easy for many travelers to participate. The author, already experienced with airline promotions through challenges like JetBlue’s 25 for 25, decided this was a low-effort way to explore Frontier’s loyalty program.

Using real flight examples, the article evaluates the value of Frontier miles across different fare bundles, including Basic, Economy, Premium, and Business. The analysis shows that mile value can vary widely, ranging from well under one cent per mile to more than two cents, depending on route, fare class, and cash pricing. Generally, cheaper cash fares produce lower redemption value, while higher fare bundles can offer more attractive returns.

The promotion is available from February 5 through February 22, 2026, but may end earlier if Frontier distributes its total allocation of 70 million promotional miles. Based on the maximum award of 5,000 miles per person, participation is effectively capped at around 14,000 members.

To qualify, participants must already have miles or points in another airline’s legitimate loyalty program. Instead of transferring or forfeiting those miles, members simply submit a screenshot proving they hold miles in another program, along with a form provided by Frontier. Frontier then awards a matching number of Travel Miles on a one-to-one basis, subject to specific thresholds. Submissions under 1,000 miles receive a minimum of 1,000 Frontier miles, while submissions above that amount are matched up to a maximum of 5,000 m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Europe's rearmament]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this video, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez discusses the evolving security landscape in Europe, particularly focusing on the need for increased defense spending and cooperation among European nations in light of geopolitical tensions.

On January 21, eight Palestinian men, including Maher Awad and Sameer Isam Aziz Zeidan, were transported shackled from Arizona to Tel Aviv, with refueling stops in New Jersey, Ireland, and Bulgaria. They were handed over to Israeli authorities at Ben Gurion Airport and dropped at a West Bank checkpoint near Ni’lin, where locals assisted them.

Gates, 70, denied these claims in an interview with Australian channel 9News, calling them 'false' and speculating that Epstein may have been trying to defame him. He clarified that he never visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island and did not engage in any sexual relationships. Gates explained that his interactions with Epstein in 2011 were primarily focused on potential investments in scientific ventures, but he now views the meetings as a mistake.

Unlike most research that focuses on adolescents, this investigation analyzed data from 26,362 participants aged 40 to 77 using the UK Biobank. The study found that moderate cannabis usage was generally associated with larger volumes in several brain regions, particularly those with high cannabinoid receptor density, and better performance in cognitive tasks such as learning, memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Interestingly, while most regions showed positive associations, the posterior cingulate area displayed lower volume in high-use participants, highlighting the complexity of cannabis effects. Sex differences were observed, with nuanced interactions suggesting the endocannabinoid system functions differently in men and women.

According to Khanna, the Justice Department identified more than 6 million documents connected to the Epstein case but released only about 3 to 3.5 million after review and redactions.

Many report entire crews vanishing overnight due to fears of detention or deportation, leaving crops like carrots unharvested and valued at nearly $1 million in some cases. This threatens contract fulfillment, potential legal actions, and even bankruptcy for affected producers, as experienced manual labor cannot be easily replaced. The issue extends beyond fields to meat and livestock processing plants, where worker shortages could slow production, reduce supply, and increase nationwide consumer prices.

Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched a pointed critique of the company’s inclusion of transgender and LGBTQ+ characters, particularly in content accessible to children. Hawley alleged that Netflix promotes what he described as a “transgender ideology,” claiming—without evidence—that nearly half of its children’s programming advances such an agenda. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos firmly rejected the assertion, stating that the figures were inaccurate and that he had no idea where they originated.

Hawley appeared to rely on claims from the conservative advocacy group Concerned Women for America, which previously asserted that 41% of certain children’s-rated Netflix series contain LGBTQ+ content. Critics note that this framing conflates all LGBTQ+ representation with transgender themes and reflects the group’s ideological bias.

In recent weeks, the site has undergone rapid changes. New infrastructure has been built, military equipment has been transported in, and terrain preparation work has intensified.

Estimated to be over 4,800 years old, this remarkable tree has been alive since before the construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt, quietly enduring vast stretches of human and natural history. Its age and resilience have made it a powerful symbol of longevity and survival in extreme environments.

Methuselah was identified in the 1950s by Edmund Schulman, a dendrochronologist from the University of Arizona, who studied tree rings to understand past climates. Through careful analysis, Schulman determined that this particular bristlecone pine was thousands of years old. To protect it from vandalism and excessive human impact, its precise location within the White Mountains is kept secret.

Fixed costs like mortgages and bills consume nearly all their income, forcing difficult choices between essential needs such as housing and food. Commentators also highlight economic challenges in traditionally Republican states, pointing to slow GDP growth, rising healthcare costs, and increasing reliance on food pantries. Analysts suggest that some voters were initially influenced by catchy slogans and memes without fully understanding how complex economic policies would affect their daily lives. Additionally, failures in the education system are cited as contributing to vo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/economic-struggles-of-middle-class-americans-under-trump-s-policies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/economic-struggles-of-middle-class-americans-under-trump-s-policies</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 01:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical Lessons from Franco’s Spain and Their Parallels in Modern America]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article draws comparisons between Francisco Franco's authoritarian regime in Spain (1936–1975) and recent political developments in the United States under Donald Trump. It highlights how extremist ideologies that begin on the fringes can become mainstream when supported by powerful institutions, as seen with Spain’s Falange party and contemporary U.S. far-right movements. The text discusses several areas of concern: the weaponization of law enforcement and secret police to suppress dissent, the promotion of traditional gender roles and curtailment of women's rights, autarkic economic policies favoring elites, and the erosion of intellectual freedom through censorship and educational influence. The author cites examples such as the Minneapolis immigration operations, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, far-right social media trends, and efforts to integrate conservative ideology into education.

According to the Stress in America 2025 survey, 63 percent of adults aged 18 to 34 have considered leaving the country due to concerns about the nation’s direction, a notable increase compared with previous years. More than half of parents reported similar thoughts, underscoring how widespread these concerns have become across generations.

The findings reflect a broader atmosphere of anxiety in the U.S., with 76 percent of adults saying they are more worried about the country’s future than they were in the past. Key stressors include rising costs of living, housing insecurity, inflation, job market uncertainty, political polarization, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Detainees described severe beatings, blindfolding, stripping, stress positions, sleep deprivation, starvation, denial of hygiene, and targeted humiliation, with some alleging attempts to permanently disable their surgical abilities. Organizations like WHO and Healthcare Workers Watch report 297-339 detained healthcare workers, with over 160 still held by early 2025. Two senior doctors died in custody amid claims of torture.

This area contained graves of dozens of Allied soldiers, primarily Australians, but also British and Polish personnel from World War II, as well as British soldiers from World War I. The destruction involved removal of gravestones, churning of topsoil, and creation of earth berms, suggesting use of heavy equipment for systematic earthworks rather than incidental bomb damage seen elsewhere around the site. Jaradah reported two operations: one clearing olive trees outside the walls and another inside affecting about 1,000 square meters, including Australian graves and areas near a memorial and visitor bench, occurring around late April or early May after Israeli withdrawal from the zone.

Previous work showed that SLU7 levels decrease during liver disease progression, contributing to cellular dedifferentiation and genomic instability, yet a residual amount remains essential for tumor cell viability in advanced stages. In this new research, conducted as part of Carla Rojo's doctoral thesis and published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, the team tested multiple strategies to silence or reduce SLU7 expression in established tumors using inducible CRISPR/Cas9, shRNAs, siRNA delivered via magnetic nanoparticles, and aptamer-conjugated siRNA for targeted delivery.

Speaking on the We Need to Talk podcast on February 3, Kerr reflected on the realization that staying together was no longer healthy for either of them. She explained that both she and Bloom acknowledged their relationship was not bringing out the best in them, which ultimately led to their decision to separate in 2013 after six years together.

Central to their post-divorce dynamic was a promise Kerr made to Bloom: to always put Flynn’s needs first. Now 15 years old, Flynn became the guiding focus as they navigated the challenges of life after their breakup. Kerr emphasized that building a respectful coparenting relationship required significant emotional work, patience, and intention from both sides.

This work, housed at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is a tempera and oil on panel piece depicting Saint Anthony the Great being tormented and lifted into the air by a group of grotesque demons. It is based on a 15th-century engraving by the German artist Martin Schongauer titled Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons, but the young Michelangelo transformed it by adding vibrant colors, enhanced textures, and atmospheric depth. According to historical accounts from Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi—Michelangelo's early biographers—the artist studied real fish specimens at the market to accurately render the scaly, animal-like features of the demons, making them more lifelike and compact than in the original engraving.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Vance was asked whether he would apologize for previously labeling Pretti an “assassin” who showed up to an ICE protest with “ill intent.” Vance responded dismissively with the question, “For what?”, and maintained that his statements were justified, despite evidence that Pretti had been disarmed before being fatally shot by federal agents.

The piece explains that Vance amplified a social media post from a senior White House official on the day of the killing, portraying Pretti as a would-be attacker of federal officers. According to the article, this framing quickly became part of a broader right-wing narrative that cast Pretti as a dangerous domestic threat rather than a civilian protester.

Epstein persistently sought meetings through intermediaries, notably Thorbjørn Jagland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and Council of Europe Secretary General, proposing discussions on Western investment in Russia, economic solutions, geopolitics, or private dinners. Emails show Epstein following up over years, sometimes referencing current events like the MH17 crash to adjust timing, but there is no evidence of any positive response from Russian authorities, no direct communication with Putin, no meetings, and no Kremlin involvement. The Kremlin has denied receiving any such offers.

START had long been a cornerstone of global nuclear stability, limiting each country to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and establishing verification mechanisms such as mutual inspections and data exchanges.

It argues that machines, like buildings or tools, are shaped by assumptions about wear, stress, and repeated use. Rather than treating wear as a failure, the text frames it as an expected and measurable result of sustained operation. Polished surfaces, compressed seals, and shifting tolerances are presented as records of work performed, not signs of neglect.

A central theme is that thoughtful design anticipates where and how wear will occur. Engineers decide which components absorb stress and which remain stable, allowing systems to age in controlled and predictable ways. Longevity, therefore, depends less on preventing change and more on managing it within acceptable boundaries. This perspective shifts attention from avoiding wear to designing systems that can be adjusted, repaired, and realigned over time.

Using traditional collage methods, he combines vintage imagery of road trips, scenic overlooks, drive-in theaters, and classic automobiles with cosmic backdrops, such as starry voids or roadways hovering above Earth. These pieces evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for an era that never fully materialized in the way retro-futurism once imagined, blending the ordinary with the extraordinary to pull viewers into dreamlike, otherworldly moments. The works draw heavily from 1960s photo album aesthetics, grounding the fantastical elements in recognizable, everyday Americana while placing them in impossible cosmic settings. This contrast immediately disrupts the ordinary and sparks wonder. High-quality prints of these artworks are available for purchase on Andreas Lie’s official website, where fans can explore and acquire them.

Bannon claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would be used to “surround” polling stations during the upcoming November elections, framing the idea as a measure to prevent what he again alleged—without evidence—to be election fraud. His comments immediately triggered widespread concern and criticism from legal experts, politicians, and members of the public, who warned that such actions would amount to voter intimidation and a serious violation of democratic norms.

Social media users reacted strongly, arguing that the presence of federal immigration officers at polling locations would discourage lawful voters, particularly immigrant communities, from participating in elections.

In a May 2017 email, Summers questioned Trump's potential involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 election—deeming it plausible but uncertain—and Epstein responded that 'your world does not understand how dumb he really is,' implying a low opinion of Trump's intelligence and suggesting he would blame others for failures. An earlier October 2016 email dismissed speculation about Trump being a cocaine user as having 'zero' plausibility. The releases also feature a proposed but never-filed federal indictment from around 2005-2007, alleging Epstein conspired with three unidentified individuals to recruit underage females (some as young as 14) for sexual acts in exchange for money, with payments and recruitment among girls]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-emails-released-criticized-trump-s-intelligence-in-exchanges-with-larry-summers-amid-broader-doj-document-disclosure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/epstein-emails-released-criticized-trump-s-intelligence-in-exchanges-with-larry-summers-amid-broader-doj-document-disclosure</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 06:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeffrey Epstein emails viewed Brexit as start of 'return to tribalism' in correspondence with Peter Thiel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Newly released documents from the US Department of Justice, part of the Jeffrey Epstein files, include emails suggesting that the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein viewed Britain's 2016 vote to leave the European Union positively. Just days after the Brexit referendum on June 23, 2016, Epstein emailed tech billionaire Peter Thiel on June 26, stating 'Brexit, just the beginning.' When Thiel asked 'Of what,' Epstein replied it signaled a 'return to tribalism, counter to globalisation, amazing new alliances.' He also referenced prior discussions on economic conditions, such as zero interest rates being too high and easier identification of collapsing systems than new opportunities. There is no indication of wrongdoing by Thiel. The release of over three million documents highlights Epstein's extensive connections to influential figures.

According to the author, Trump publicly shared a screenshot of a private conversation with Macron, an act described as an unprecedented breach of diplomatic discretion. The author argues that the true scandal is not the indiscretion itself, but the lack of substantive media coverage about the content of the exchange.

The piece claims that the conversation implicitly confirms close coordination between the United States and France regarding military and political actions in Syria, contradicting what the author portrays as the dominant media narrative of a purely internal, popular uprising against dictatorship.

Thomas Massie (R-KY) against sharp attacks from President Donald Trump. The conflict stems from Trump's Truth Social post on February 2, 2026, where he labeled Massie an 'unreliable' Republican, possibly a RINO, and blamed his recent marriage to Carolyn Moffa (a three-time Trump voter) for supposedly turning him liberal or disloyal. Trump endorsed Massie's primary challenger, Ed Gallrein, a retired Navy SEAL and farmer, highlighting GOP internal divisions over loyalty, policy votes, and issues like the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related files. Massie, known for his conservative record and 91% alignment with Trump on votes, has opposed measures such as foreign aid to Israel and full protection of certain Epstein associates.

Speaking on the program Nostalgia Tonight with Joe Sibilia, Jones described a marriage that evolved significantly over time but remained emotionally connected even after it ended. Jim and Jane met while studying puppetry at the University of Maryland and married in 1959, forming both a romantic partnership and the foundation of what would become the Muppets empire.

According to Jones, their early bond was intense and genuine, with Jane playing a critical role in Jim’s creative beginnings. She collaborated closely with him on early projects such as Sam and Friends and was deeply involved in shaping his artistic vision. However, as Jim’s career accelerated and the Muppets became a global success, their relationship dynamic shifted.

Patey, who has no criminal charges, has allowed fellow protesters to use his apartment bathroom or wash off pepper spray, which Fox News hosts like Laura Ingraham labeled an 'Antifa safe house.' The designation stems from open-source intelligence, including social media videos where he advocates Antifa principles, and is part of broader DHS efforts using the Intelligence Reporting System - Next Generation (IRS-NG) to track alleged left-wing domestic threats.

Although the discounted purchase price is higher than Frequent Miler’s estimated reasonable redemption value for Marriott points, the deal can still make sense in specific scenarios.

She was last seen on Sunday, February 1, and concerns escalated after law enforcement processed the scene at her residence.

Officials stated that evidence found at the home suggested signs of forced removal, leading them to believe the incident may have occurred during the night while she was asleep. A spokesperson for the sheriff’s department said investigators do not believe she left on her own and emphasized that her limited mobility makes it unlikely she could have walked away without assistance.

The plan assumed that the United States would quickly neutralize British forces and occupy key Canadian cities, including Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa, to prevent Britain from using Canada as a staging ground.

The individual, who voted for Trump three times and actively campaigned during the first two elections, admitted to growing reservations by the third vote, particularly concerning the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the January 6 events. Despite these concerns, he initially held hope that Trump could still effect positive change within flawed systems. He describes his evolution as resulting from thousands of hours of reading, research, and close observation of political and economic operations since around 2019. He strongly rejects accusations of developing 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' overnight, calling it mind-blowing and insisting his change stems from sustained attention and evidence-based analysis.

The move reflects growing concern among European governments about reliance on American technology firms for critical digital infrastructure, particularly in areas involving sensitive government communications and data protection.

French authorities are encouraging the adoption of European-developed alternatives that comply more closely with EU data protection rules, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Officials argue that even when U.S. companies store data on European servers, they may still be subject to American laws that allow U.S. authorities to access data, raising sovereignty and security concerns.

Originally intended to have a smiling expression, the toy ended up with a frown due to a manufacturing error, which has resonated with young workers who identify with its sad appearance. On Chinese social media platforms such as Sina Weibo and RedNote, the toy has become a symbol of the overworked and undervalued, reflecting widespread social fatigue under China's demanding '996' work culture, where employees often work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. The phenomenon has sparked memes and posts relating the crying horse to everyday workplace frustrations. The small plush, priced under $5, has seen such high demand that the manufacturer added production lines and now ships internationally.

Normally, a one-way Loganair award ticket costs 6,500 Avios, but during this sale, flights can be booked for only 3,250 Avios. To take advantage of this offer, bookings must be made by February 10, 2026, for travel starting March 7, 2026. Certain routes, including inter-Orkney flights, as well as interline and codeshare flights, are excluded from the promotion. This sale can provide significant value for travelers, especially on routes where cash fares are relatively high. For example, a flight from Aberdeen to Kirkwall in March can cost between £106 and £198 ($145-$271), meaning that redeeming only 3,250 Avios can offer 4.46 to 8.34 cents per point in value. Although Loganair is not a direct partner of any transferable points currency, members can transfer points from programs like British Airways Avios to book these discounted flights.

Rather than treating buildings as sealed, static objects, breathing spaces are designed as dynamic frameworks that interact continuously with nature and human presence. From the moment one enters such a space, subtle elements—shifting daylight, gentle airflow, softened boundaries between indoors and outdoors—create a sense of calm and vitality.

Central to this approach is the rejection of over-containment. Designers prioritize orientation, openness, and the strategic use of natural light as a core material. Daylight is allowed to define rhythm and mood throughout the day, while shadows, reflections, and transparency are embraced instead of tightly controlled. Openings such as large glazed doors, sliding panels, and folding systems become active architectural elements, enabling cross-ventilation, visua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diplomatic Talks Temporarily Delay U.S. Military Action Against Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[Diplomatic efforts between the United States and Iran have led to a temporary postponement of any potential U.S. military strike on Iran.

Jared Kushner, along with senior officials from Turkey, Qatar, and Egypt, is also participating in the negotiations.

Some emails show Chomsky and his wife Valeria engaging in friendly exchanges with Epstein and discussing meetings with prominent figures such as Steve Bannon and possibly Woody Allen. 

Chomsky also provided advice to Epstein in 2019 regarding public criticism following court rulings about Epstein's past sex offenses.

Feeling protected goes beyond physical safety to include emotional reassurance through stable, predictable environments that allow the nervous system to relax, improving focus and decision-making. Key qualities include clear organization, visual balance, supportive boundaries, and comforting sensory elements like lighting, sound, and texture.

Grounding connects people to the present and their surroundings via natural materials (wood, stone, fabrics), nature-inspired colors, natural light, and outdoor views, reducing anxiety and enhancing belonging.

The test, which simulates fueling and countdown procedures up to T-20 seconds, involved loading approximately 987 tons of cryogenic propellants into the SLS core stage (144 tons of liquid hydrogen and 840 tons of liquid oxygen) and additional propellant into the ICPS upper stage. Although the tanks were successfully filled for the first time in this campaign—a significant improvement over Artemis I—the test was halted multiple times due to persistent hydrogen leaks at the tail service mast umbilicals (TSMU), the same quick-disconnect interfaces at the base of the core stage that caused repeated delays in 2022.

Multiple independent security researchers attribute the attack to a Chinese state-sponsored group, citing the highly selective targeting typical of espionage campaigns. The shared hosting server was compromised until September 2, 2025, after which attackers retained internal service credentials until December 2, 2025, allowing continued redirection.

Rather than using digital manipulation, the project relies entirely on physical alignment, color, and pattern to create the illusion that people and even animals blend seamlessly into their surroundings. Each sweater is custom designed and knitted to precisely match a specific background, such as tiled walls, bus seat upholstery, running tracks, murals, or natural foliage.

Over several years of collaboration, Ford and Dodd have developed a process that combines careful observation with traditional craftsmanship.

It compares modern election strategies to online retail tactics, where voters are segmented into tiny demographic groups and targeted with personalized digital messages to influence behavior, including voting decisions. Unlike traditional methods relying on rallies, posters, or broad TV appeals, Trump's team, under Brad Parscale's 'Proyecto Álamo,' built extensive psychological profiles on 220 million Americans by integrating voter data, purchase histories, gun ownership records, and online activity from sources like Facebook, Experian, and Acxiom. This enabled the creation of over 100,000 unique ad pieces and nearly a billion text messages, with ads tailored to more than 4,000 traits per person based on psychometrics research linking Facebook 'likes' to personality via the OCEAN model.

The article argues that France’s Third Republic (1870–1940), often celebrated as a milestone of democratic freedoms and civic rights, simultaneously consolidated a brutal and explicitly racist colonial system. While republican liberties, secular education, and parliamentary life flourished within metropolitan France, the empire was governed through coercion, legal discrimination, and permanent states of exception.

Poch details how colonial domination was codified through mechanisms such as the Code de l’Indigénat, which denied basic rights to colonized populations and institutionalized forced labor, collective punishment, and racial hierarchy.

According to the author, making this clause more concrete could significantly lower the threshold for EU involvement in armed conflict, especially if Ukraine joins the EU as planned in early 2027 while hostilities with Russia continue.

At 61 years old, she suffers from multiple serious and chronic health conditions, including advanced HIV, severe malnutrition, cardiovascular and liver problems, and respiratory disorders. Despite her critical health, Spanish prison authorities have denied her access to compassionate release and progression to less restrictive imprisonment, citing only her lack of ideological repentance, without considering medical or security risks. Legal experts from various countries argue that this practice violates the European Convention on Human Rights (CEDH), specifically Articles 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10, which protect the right to life, prohibition of inhuman treatment, private and family life, and freedom of thought and expression. The article references European Court of Human Rights cases, such as Kudla v. Poland and Mouisel v.

Romance often involves ambiguity, where people interpret signals inconsistently, leading to anxiety. A single percentage offers reassurance by simplifying complex factors like values, communication styles, emotional safety, life stages, and stress tolerance into one digestible figure. Psychologically, this appeal stems from biases: anchoring makes the initial score shape perceptions of friction; precision bias lends undue credibility to a neat number; and confirmation bias leads people to seek supporting evidence while ignoring contradictions. Most tools, such as name-based love calculators, rely on arbitrary algorithms inspired by numerology or astrology for entertainment rather than accurate measurement of relationship quality. While they vary in results due to different formulas, they can serve positive roles whe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-people-are-drawn-to-simple-compatibility-percentages-in-relationships</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-people-are-drawn-to-simple-compatibility-percentages-in-relationships</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Breeze Airways Offers 26% Discount on Round-Trip Base Fares with Promo Code WEEKDAY for Midweek Travel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Breeze Airways has launched a promotional offer providing a 26% discount on the base fare for round-trip flights when travelers use the promo code WEEKDAY during booking. This deal is available for new reservations made between February 3, 2026, and February 5, 2026, at 11:59 pm PT, through the airline's website or app. The discounted travel period runs from February 26, 2026, to September 15, 2026, but the promotion excludes flights on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, meaning it applies specifically to weekday travel to ensure the full discount. Key restrictions include that the discount applies solely to the base fare, not to taxes, fees, or additional charges like seat assignments or baggage, which can significantly reduce the overall savings on the total ticket price. The offer cannot be combined with other promotions, is not valid for group bookings, and any changes to reservations may result in fare repricing at current rates.

The conviction was for aiding a foreign state (identified as Russia) in activities directed against Latvia and for inciting national hatred and hostility. The charges stem from his 10-minute remote participation in a February 2025 online conference organized by the Moscow-based Institute of CIS Countries, titled 'The Ethnocide of Russian Compatriots in the Baltic States as a Factor in Preparing for War Against Russia.' In his speech, Gapoņenko discussed academic distinctions between genocide and ethnocide, defended Russia's diaspora support policies, highlighted alleged oppression of Russians in Latvia (including language restrictions and school closures), and reportedly suggested that a Russian invasion could halt such 'ethnocide,' along wi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/latvia-sentences-pro-kremlin-activist-aleksandrs-gaponenko-to-10-years-in-prison-for-inciting-hatred-and-aiding-foreign-state</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/latvia-sentences-pro-kremlin-activist-aleksandrs-gaponenko-to-10-years-in-prison-for-inciting-hatred-and-aiding-foreign-state</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 19:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Top Credit Card Welcome Bonuses and Offers in the US for February 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frequent Miler's comprehensive guide for February 2026 lists the best publicly available welcome offers for nearly 300 U.S. credit cards from issuers like American Express, Chase, Citi, Capital One, and others.

The complaints emerged following a major hiring drive that added roughly 12,000 new agents, intended to strengthen enforcement operations nationwide. Instead, many new recruits report that basic administrative systems have failed to keep pace with the rapid expansion.

Posts on the unofficial subreddit r/ICE_ERO describe officers waiting a month or more for their first paycheck and remaining uninsured weeks after starting work. Several employees said the absence of health coverage left them unable to afford medical care for their children.

Minaj, who has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States for around 20 years, previously suggested that the card could expedite her path to citizenship. However, a White House official stated that the card was symbolic and had no impact on her immigration status. Minaj shared the card following her participation in a White House event promoting children’s investment accounts under a Trump-backed initiative, where she was praised by President Trump for her financial contributions and support. Over recent years, Minaj has increasingly aligned herself with Trump and the MAGA movement, publicly describing herself as the president’s “No. 1 fan” and defending her support despite criticism from fans and civil rights groups.

Many factory workers, retirees, and farmers interviewed report that everyday costs such as groceries, utilities, and fuel remain high, undermining expectations that inflation would ease quickly after Trump returned to office.

Mark Baker, a retired factory worker living on Social Security in Waterman, Illinois, explains that limited local shopping options leave residents paying elevated prices for basic items like eggs, milk, and soda. He says incremental price increases make budgeting increasingly difficult, particularly for people on fixed incomes. Baker also expresses disappointment that Trump did not prioritize lowering costs immediately after taking office, which had been a central reason for his vote.

Indigenous communities such as the Inuit, Sámi, and Chukchi had long-established societies adapted to extreme conditions, relying on seasonal hunting, sleds, skin boats, and clothing made from furs and hides. Their knowledge of ice, weather, and wildlife was crucial for survival. Photographers like William Bradford documented these regions and people, producing rare images that capture daily life, whaling activities, icebound ships, and Arctic settlements. European interest in the Arctic evolved from Viking settlements to expeditions driven by trade routes and scientific curiosity. Notable explorers included Sir John Franklin, Fridtjof Nansen, Frederick Cook, Robert Peary, Richard E. Byrd, and Roald Amundsen.

Emails reveal that Epstein discussed potential blackmail and offered intelligence insights to the Kremlin, including information regarding former US President Donald Trump. Epstein's connections may have been facilitated through business dealings with media magnate Robert Maxwell, who was allegedly a Russian asset.

Despite mixed reviews and competition from films like 'Send Help' and 'Iron Lung' (which grossed $17.9 million), 'Melania' earned approximately $7 million domestically in its opening weekend, surpassing industry expectations of $2-5 million and marking the strongest non-concert documentary opening in over a decade. However, Wood Jr. highlighted its modest appeal by posing a mock trivia question: comparing ticket sales for a specific 3:40 pm showing at AMC's 34th Street Theater in New York City to the capacity of a Smart car.

This marks a dramatic decline from 3.5 million cases across 21 countries when the eradication program began in 1986. The worm is transmitted through contaminated water containing copepods carrying larvae. Once ingested, the parasite migrates through the body and emerges painfully from the skin, typically in the legs or feet, potentially causing severe infections or disability. The remaining human cases in 2025 were reported in Chad, Ethiopia, and South Sudan. However, animal infections, particularly in dogs, continue to pose a challenge. Countries reporting animal cases include Chad, Mali, Cameroon, Angola, Ethiopia, and South Sudan.

While her remarks received applause inside the venue, social media users highlighted the apparent contradiction of her advocating for migrant rights while living on land once owned by the Tongva people. Commentators suggested she should either return the property or open it to migrants.

Buying groups pool purchasing power from many members to acquire large quantities of discounted merchandise or gift cards—items often restricted by per-person limits—then resell them, allowing sellers to offload products to the group after purchase. The process typically involves signing up with a group, monitoring deals via email, Telegram, WhatsApp or similar channels, committing to buy specific items, purchasing with credit cards (often drop-shipped to tax-exempt warehouses), providing tracking, waiting for receipt confirmation (usually 3-5 days), and receiving payment via ACH after a short float period of 2-3 weeks.

Normally, 1,000 Chase points convert to 1,000 Marriott points, but during this promotion, they convert to 1,500 points. While this can increase the number of Marriott points you receive, the overall value may not be optimal for every user. Frequent Miler estimates Chase points are worth approximately 1.5 cents each, and Marriott points about 0.76 cents each. With the bonus, the effective value is around 1.14 cents per Chase point, which is lower than redeeming directly through Chase Travel with the right card. This transfer bonus is most valuable when you have a specific high-value Marriott redemption in mind. Marriott allows a “stay 5, pay 4” benefit for all members, and it’s possible to find award nights where the point value exceeds 1 cent per point, making select redemptions worthwhile.

Zachary Radcliff, 30, is accused of abusing 11 children and faces 60 criminal charges, including 17 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, with the possibility of life imprisonment. The lawsuits claim the church fostered a culture of silence, prioritizing loyalty to the institution over accountability and the safety of its members. Allegations suggest that inappropriate behavior by Zachary Radcliff began when he was a teenager, and some victims were coerced into sending explicit videos in exchange for money. Church leaders reportedly misrepresented Zachary’s actions and location to authorities while allowing him access to church funds for grooming purposes.

New cardholders can earn 85,000 Atmos Rewards points plus a companion fare after spending $4,500 within the first 90 days. With a modest $95 annual fee, this promotion positions the card as a strong option for those seeking high-value travel rewards at a relatively low upfront cost.

The bonus alone can be enough for premium travel redemptions, particularly given the strong redemption sweet spots within the Atmos program. For example, travelers based in the northeastern United States may find one-way business class awards to Europe starting at 45,000 points, making it possible to nearly cover a round-trip business class ticket shortly after meeting the minimum spending requirement. Factoring in the points earned from qualifying purchases, cardholders could accumulate close to 90,000 points quickly.

A witness reported seeing a woman in visible distress near the intersection of Sierra Highway and Technology Drive in Palmdale shortly after midnight, prompting a call to authorities. Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies and paramedics responded, providing treatment at the scene before transporting her to a nearby hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. Initially described as a medical emergency, the case was transferred to the LASD homicide unit, which is standard protocol for unexpected deaths of young people under unusual or unclear circumstances, rather than an immediate indication of foul play. As of early February 2026, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office had not released an official cause of death, and the investigation continued.

He notes that many additional actions—such as CIA assassinations outside coups, US-backed death squad massacres, sanctions, threats, and political pressures—were excluded to allow completion of the project.

Pena, who immigrated to the United States in 2009, is well known online for openly identifying as an immigrant and sharing stories about people seeking better lives in the U.S. At the same time, he has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and has publicly defended the administration’s hard-line immigration policies.

The arrest came amid heightened immigration enforcement during the early days of Trump’s renewed immigration crackdown. Following reports that Brazilians were among those detained or deported during the administration’s first week, Pena addressed his followers in Portuguese, urging them not to panic.

Turner alleges in specific files that Wayne impregnated an 11-year-old girl in Mexico, with DNA evidence purportedly confirming paternity at 100%, leading to a 2017 life imprisonment sentence in Mexico. According to Turner, Wayne evaded the sentence through a payoff arrangement involving the U.S. State Department and a Mexican judge, allowing a former U.S. Marine to serve the time instead, and that an outstanding arrest warrant remains in Mexico. Additional claims involve Wayne's alleged presence during a 2014 Mexican Federal Police raid on the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, Epstein's visits to the embassy, and related materials found with former Navy SEAL Richard Marcinko.

The agreement brings together major national and pan-European payment solutions under a shared vision of reducing Europe’s dependence on non-European payment providers while offering consumers and merchants a competitive, homegrown alternative.

The cooperation builds on the existing success of domestic payment systems by connecting them through a central interoperability hub. This hub, to be operated by a jointly established entity, will act as a technical layer allowing transactions to flow seamlessly between national and European solutions, while preserving each solution’s brand, user experience and features.

The project allows participants to interact with a forest environment by speaking or singing into sculptural 'whispering dishes,' which convert their voices into low-frequency vibrations. These vibrations travel through a wooden platform and into the soil, enabling people to experience sound as a physical and ecological phenomenon. Rather than imposing human presence on nature, Forest Mixer integrates humans into the forest's soundscape, highlighting the relationship between humans and the environment. This installation emphasizes the subtle, often unnoticed rhythms of the forest, allowing participants to perceive nature not just visually or audibly, but also physically.

This decision is aimed at preventing the far-right Chega party leader, André Ventura, from winning the presidency. Ventura, who secured nearly a quarter of votes in January's first round, has risen rapidly by campaigning against minority groups, criticizing immigration, and denouncing government corruption. Prominent figures supporting Seguro include former President Aníbal Cavaco Silva, ex-Deputy Prime Minister Paulo Portas, and Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas. Thousands of non-socialist public figures have also signed an open letter backing Seguro, emphasizing a defense of democratic values over party loyalty.

The author emphasizes the impracticality of proper disposal in everyday life, as people are unlikely to carry used wipes to a trash bin.

Experts and political commentators reacted strongly, calling the initiative reminiscent of authoritarian practices. Immigration specialist Aaron Reichlin-Melnick described the post as encouraging citizens to report neighbors to gain housing, while journalist Aaron Rupar called it 'straight up Gestapo.'

His Afrobeat compositions feature extended arrangements, brass sections, and repetitive percussion, influencing musicians globally across jazz, hip-hop, and funk.

Standing before an audience of industry peers, Bad Bunny opened his remarks by declaring 'ICE out,' a statement that immediately drew a strong reaction from the crowd. He then challenged dehumanizing rhetoric often directed at immigrants, emphasizing that they are not criminals or outsiders but human beings who are part of American society.

The pact builds upon previous bilateral agreements: Iran and Russia's 20-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and Iran and China's 25-year Cooperation Agreement aimed at trade, infrastructure, and energy integration. The new trilateral framework aligns the three countries on issues such as nuclear sovereignty, economic cooperation, military coordination, and diplomatic strategy.

French President Macron acknowledged in a conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky that the current legal framework was insufficient and indicated plans to amend domestic legislation to allow future actions against Russian tankers to comply with the law.

Según el Servicio Federal de Seguridad (FSB), el detenido es Liubomir Korba, ciudadano ucraniano, arrestado gracias a una operación realizada en cooperación con las autoridades de Emiratos Árabes Unidos. Moscú sostiene que Korba actuó siguiendo instrucciones de los servicios de inteligencia ucranianos y que viajó a la capital rusa en diciembre de 2025 con el objetivo de cometer el atentado.

Tras abrir fuego contra el general en un edificio residencial del noroeste de Moscú, el sospechoso habría abandonado Rusia pocas horas después y volado a Dubái, donde finalmente fue localizado y detenido.

El resultado es especialmente relevante porque el distrito había sido ganado por Donald Trump por 13 puntos en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, lo que llevó a los republicanos a considerar este escaño como una oportunidad clara para recuperarlo.

La elección especial se convocó tras la salida del anterior representante estatal, también demócrata, que fue nombrado comisionado del Departamento de Alcohol y Tabaco del estado por el gobernador republicano Jeff Landry. Aunque el escaño ya estaba en manos demócratas y, por tanto, no supone un cambio de partido, la magnitud de la victoria de Verret Martinez destaca por representar un giro de 37 puntos respecto a los resultados de 2024 en ese mismo distrito.

Aunque el área no estaba incluida inicialmente en zonas de vigilancia arqueológica, la Evaluación Ambiental estableció un seguimiento preventivo que ha permitido documentar hallazgos relevantes sin paralizar el proyecto.

Entre los descubrimientos destaca una necrópolis islámica de época andalusí, formada por enterramientos sencillos excavados directamente en la tierra y sin ajuar funerario. Los restos óseos aparecieron en niveles muy superficiales, junto a materiales cerámicos fragmentados y restos de vidrio. Este hallazgo se suma a otras necrópolis islámicas ya documentadas en barrios históricos como el Carmen, la Xerea o la Almoina, reforzando el conocimiento sobre la València musulmana.

Según la resolución, Mohammadi ha sido condenada a seis años de cárcel por los cargos de congregación y colusión, y a un año y medio adicional por actividades propagandísticas.

Un ejemplo poco conocido es la rebelión de esclavos afroamericanos que tuvo lugar en 1842 en territorio de la nación Cherokee, un episodio que cuestiona los relatos tradicionales sobre opresores y oprimidos.

A comienzos del siglo XIX, varias naciones indígenas del sureste de Estados Unidos —entre ellas los Cherokee— optaron por adoptar costumbres europeas para intentar sobrevivir a la presión del gobierno federal y de los colonos. Este proceso de asimilación, que les valió el nombre de las “Cinco Tribus Civilizadas”, incluyó la adopción del cristianismo, la agricultura de plantación y, de forma clave, la esclavitud de personas negras. Para las élites cherokee, poseer esclavos era tanto una fuente de riqueza como una prueba de “civilización” ante Washington.

Ayuso sostuvo que el Partido Popular no contribuirá a lo que considera un proceso de descrédito personal sin resolución judicial y advirtió del daño irreversible que, a su juicio, provocan las acusaciones difundidas antes de que se pronuncien los tribunales. En ese contexto, defendió que siempre hay tiempo para condenar si la justicia lo determina, pero no para reparar el honor de alguien si se le ha destruido previamente.

El 8 de febrero de 1937, tras la caída de Málaga en manos de las tropas sublevadas, una enorme columna de civiles —entre 150.000 y 300.000 personas— huyó por la carretera costera hacia Almería. Durante la huida, fueron atacados desde el aire y el mar, provocando entre 3.000 y 5.000 muertes, lo que convierte este suceso en una de las mayores masacres del conflicto.

El texto se centra especialmente en el uso propagandístico de la fotografía durante y después de estos hechos. Explica cómo el bando sublevado intentó ocultar la masacre mediante la manipulación de la información y el uso engañoso de imágenes publicadas en la prensa de la época, como en el diario ABC de Sevilla.

Las municiones de racimo están prohibidas por la Convención sobre Municiones en Racimo debido a su elevado impacto sobre la población civil, ya que dispersan submuniciones que con frecuencia no explotan y permanecen activas durante años.

Reconoce que existen riesgos reales en internet, como el acoso, los contenidos sexuales no solicitados o determinadas dinámicas tóxicas en redes sociales.

A pesar de la creciente vigilancia israelí y los peligros que implica saltar el muro, muchos se ven obligados a hacerlo para subsistir, pues la situación económica en Cisjordania se ha vuelto insostenible.

Lluvias persistentes, nieve, viento y crecidas de ríos obligan a animales de muy distintas especies a tomar decisiones rápidas para sobrevivir, con un alto coste energético y riesgos reales de mortalidad. La supervivencia, según explican expertos en comportamiento animal y veterinaria, se basa principalmente en tres estrategias: buscar refugio adecuado, conservar el calor corporal y, cuando es posible, desplazarse a zonas menos castigadas.

En mamíferos terrestres, el principal peligro es la humedad prolongada. Un pelaje mojado pierde capacidad aislante, aumenta el estrés fisiológico y debilita el sistema inmune, facilitando infecciones y reduciendo la capacidad de reacción. Las madrigueras, que normalmente actúan como refugio seguro, pueden convertirse en trampas mortales si se inundan por la subida del nivel freático o la escorrentía.

Fuentes gubernamentales aseguran que desconocían inicialmente el desplazamiento y recalcan que Zapatero no ostenta cargo público alguno, por lo que sus movimientos en Caracas no corresponden al ámbito de actuación del Gobierno. La posición oficial se resume en una idea clara: se trata de una iniciativa privada y ajena a la política exterior del Estado.

El viaje coincide con un momento políticamente sensible en Venezuela, marcado por la aprobación de una Ley de Amnistía impulsada por el oficialismo, que ha dado lugar a excarcelaciones y revisiones de causas judiciales, algunas de ellas relacionadas con ciudadanos españoles o con doble nacionalidad.

Según los correos electrónicos incorporados a los archivos, Epstein describió aquel encuentro como una cena 'salvaje' y llegó a compartir la imagen con varios contactos personales.

En la charla titulada 'Una conversación honesta sobre la IA y la Humanidad', junto a la neurocientífica Irene Tracey, Harari presentó la inteligencia artificial no como una mera herramienta, sino como un agente autónomo capaz de tomar decisiones, aprender y evolucionar, comparándola con mercenarios sajones que traicionaron a los britanos en el siglo V. Destacó especialmente una supuesta 'exclusiva': que las IAs han acuñado por sí mismas el término 'The Watchers' (Los Observadores) para referirse a los humanos, invirtiendo los roles de vigilantes y vigilados, lo que generó temor entre los asistentes.

La niña pidió en varias ocasiones que la bloqueara, pero él insistió en que disimulara ante sus padres. El abuelo materno descubrió los mensajes, ya que la foto de perfil del contacto era de un adulto, y decidió continuar la conversación haciéndose pasar por su nieta.

El reportaje de EL PAÍS analiza cómo este fenómeno genera una creciente inseguridad vital entre mayores de 45 años que no han podido acceder a la vivienda en propiedad y afrontan su futuro con incertidumbre.

Casos como el de Ramón Bultó, de 57 años, o Iván Aranda, de 46, reflejan una realidad cada vez más común: salarios relativamente estables que no garantizan seguridad residencial a largo plazo. La imposibilidad de ahorrar para la entrada de una hipoteca, el encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y la escasez de oferta empujan a muchos a asumir contratos frágiles y caros, sin la tranquilidad que tradicionalmente aportaba la propiedad como “plan de pensiones”.

El documental de HBO Max *Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!*, dirigido por Judd Apatow y Mike Bonfiglio, repasa la trayectoria de un creador incansable que nunca ha contemplado la jubilación. Actor, guionista, director, productor y compositor, Brooks convirtió el humor en una herramienta política y cultural, capaz de ridiculizar el poder y desafiar los tabúes.

Nacido como Melvin Kaminsky en Brooklyn, creció marcado por la muerte temprana de su padre y por una infancia de burlas y precariedad. Esa mezcla de rabia y vulnerabilidad se transformó en su combustible creativo. Sus primeros pasos en la televisión, especialmente en *Your Show of Shows* junto a Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon o Woody Allen, lo situaron en el epicentro del nacimiento del humor televisivo estadounidense.

Esta medida, tras una reunión mantenida con el experto, podría recaudar más de 5.200 millones de euros anuales según estimaciones del Observatorio Fiscal de la Unión Europea. El objetivo principal es destinar estos fondos a una prestación universal por crianza que permita erradicar la pobreza infantil en el país, un problema que el ministro califica de persistente y con niveles muy altos. Bustinduy ha resaltado el potencial impacto social de la iniciativa y la necesidad de recuperar el control democrático sobre aspectos económicos clave. Entre los afectados estarían destacados empresarios españoles: Amancio Ortega (fundador de Inditex), con un patrimonio estimado en 2025 de 109.900 millones de euros, pagaría alrededo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bustinduy-propone-un-impuesto-del-2-a-fortunas-superiores-a-100-millones-para-financiar-una-prestacion-universal-contra-la-pobreza-infantil</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bustinduy-propone-un-impuesto-del-2-a-fortunas-superiores-a-100-millones-para-financiar-una-prestacion-universal-contra-la-pobreza-infantil</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 13:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xuanyi Geng, de 8 años, bate récords mundiales en el cubo de Rubik 3x3x3]]></title><description><![CDATA[En el Beijing Winter 2026, celebrado el 11 de enero en Pekín, Xuanyi Geng, un prodigio chino de tan solo 8 años, estableció dos nuevos récords mundiales en el cubo de Rubik 3x3x3. Por un lado, logró el récord del mejor promedio resolviendo cinco cubos con un tiempo de 3,84 segundos, y por otro, el récord del cubo individual más rápido con 3,05 segundos. Este logro es especialmente notable porque el récord de promedio es considerado más difícil que el de un solo cubo, ya que requiere constancia y precisión en múltiples intentos. Xuanyi utilizó un método avanzado llamado ZV, creado en 2003, que exige memorizar cerca de 800 algoritmos, algo que hasta ahora parecía impracticable para establecer récords mundiales. Durante la competición, sus tiempos fueron progresando de 5,09 s a 3,37 s en su quinto intento, asegurando la media ganadora. Además de su destreza técnica, el joven aplicó trucos de manipulación con sus dedos, perfeccionados por él mismo.

Tras la breve gestión de Sean Duffy como administrador interino y la llegada de Jared Isaacman al cargo, la agencia presiona para acelerar el alunizaje tripulado y evitar que China adelante en la carrera lunar. Artemis III se mantiene prevista para 2028, pero depende del éxito del Human Landing System (HLS) de SpaceX basado en Starship, que requiere una prueba no tripulada en 2027 y demostrar trasvase orbital de propelentes.

Elon Musk ha decidido posponer indefinidamente los ambiciosos planes marcianos (inicialmente cinco Starships en 2026) para centrarse en la Luna, según anuncios recientes a inversores, donde menciona una prueba HLS en marzo de 2027. Starship tuvo complicaciones en 2025, pero la versión v3 podría cambiar el rumbo.

Desde finales de enero, camina cada día 32 kilómetros entre su casa en Troarn y su centro educativo en Caen, en la región de Normandía. En total, dedica más de seis horas diarias a recorrer el camino de ida y vuelta, enfrentándose al frío, la lluvia y la oscuridad propias del invierno, con el objetivo de recaudar fondos para mejorar el acceso a la educación de niños que viven en zonas aisladas.

La iniciativa, titulada “480 km para aprender”, nació a partir de una reflexión cotidiana compartida con sus compañeros de clase. Mathis tomó conciencia de que muchas de las quejas habituales sobre madrugar o los trayectos largos contrastan con la realidad de miles de menores en el mundo que recorren grandes distancias para poder ir a la escuela, o que directamente no pueden hacerlo.

Así nació iLovePDF, inicialmente como un proyecto personal que compaginaba con su trabajo de diseño web autónomo. Lo que empezó resolviendo problemas básicos como unir, dividir o copiar contenido de PDFs se convirtió rápidamente en una solución popular por su simplicidad, calidad y gratuidad. En 2014 pasó a dedicarse a tiempo completo, en 2017 abrió oficina y contrató equipo, y actualmente cuenta con 43 empleados.

Mientras formaciones como PSOE, Vox, Podemos, Sumar, PNV o ERC cuentan con protocolos (algunos desde hace años y otros actualizados recientemente), el PP se ampara en su Código Ético y de Conducta, que menciona el acoso de forma genérica pero no detalla procedimientos específicos ni se ajusta plenamente a la normativa vigente.

Según la propia compañía, la incautación se habría producido sin que mediara una orden judicial previa, un hecho que ha generado críticas y dudas legales tanto por parte de la empresa como de usuarios y analistas del sector.

Windscribe ha explicado que el servidor afectado opera bajo una arquitectura “RAM-only”, es decir, no utiliza discos duros ni sistemas de almacenamiento persistente. Toda la información se ejecuta exclusivamente en memoria volátil, lo que implica que, al apagar o desconectar el equipo, los datos desaparecen automáticamente. Además, la empresa mantiene una política estricta de no guardar registros de actividad ni información identificable de sus usuarios, por lo que sostiene que el hardware incautado no contiene datos útiles desde el punto de vista de la investigación.

Las críticas principales se centran en la ausencia de un compromiso explícito con la suficiencia financiera, incumpliendo acuerdos previos y la meta del 1% del PIB para universidades públicas, lo que agrava la infrafinanciación denunciada desde 2024 y 2025 (incluyendo deudas de 50 millones de euros).

Tellado subrayó la importancia de la participación de Quiles en los actos del partido, recordando que el joven estuvo vinculado a la formación de Alvise Pérez, Se acabó la fiesta (SALF), antes de colaborar con el PP en varios eventos de campaña. 

Tellado estableció una comparación entre Quiles y el presentador televisivo El Gran Wyoming, argumentando que lo único que hace el primero es 'preguntar con un micrófono', algo que, según él, también hacía el comunicador en su programa 'Caiga quien caiga'.

El texto se centra en explicar un repunte previo y un posterior desplome del déficit, poniendo el foco en las decisiones tomadas por los importadores estadounidenses ante la inminente entrada en vigor de nuevos aranceles. Según se expone, muchas empresas optaron por adelantar compras y acumular inventarios de todo tipo de productos para esquivar el encarecimiento futuro derivado de las medidas proteccionistas, lo que provocó un aumento artificial de las importaciones en un primer momento.

Posteriormente, una vez aplicados los aranceles, las importaciones se redujeron de forma notable, contribuyendo a un aparente reequilibrio de la balanza comercial.

Este virus herpes común permanece latente en el organismo de hasta el 60 % de la población adulta, sin causar síntomas evidentes en la mayoría de los casos. Sin embargo, en personas mayores, puede reactivarse de forma localizada y contribuir a procesos patológicos en la cabeza del fémur.

Esta información altamente sensible fue comunicada a la directora de Inteligencia Nacional (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard, quien, en lugar de permitir su distribución rutinaria entre agencias, llevó una copia en papel directamente a la jefa de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, Susie Wiles. Al día siguiente, ordenó a la NSA no publicar el informe y que los detalles clasificados se enviaran exclusivamente a su oficina. El denunciante presentó una queja formal en mayo de 2025 ante la oficina del inspector general de la comunidad de inteligencia, alegando que Gabbard bloqueó la difusión estándar.

Según la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, los cambios introducidos en la Ley de Acompañamiento de la Comunidad Valenciana suponen una restricción grave de los derechos de las personas LGTBI+ y generan una desigualdad territorial incompatible con la Constitución. El Ejecutivo considera inaceptable que los ciudadanos valencianos tengan menos derechos y libertades que el resto de la población en España.

La reforma, aprobada en mayo para garantizar el respaldo de Vox a los presupuestos autonómicos, incluye enmiendas que eliminan derechos previamente consolidados.

Estas viviendas, en una zona cotizada como la Playa de San Juan, se adjudicaron sin los controles previos que existían antes de las reformas normativas impulsadas por el Gobierno valenciano de Carlos Mazón en 2024, que eliminaron la obligatoriedad de inscripción en el registro autonómico para promociones privadas y otros requisitos para prevenir fraudes.

Este hecho contrasta con la grave emergencia habitacional en la Comunitat Valenciana: el registro de demandantes de vivienda protegida se multiplicó por seis en tres años, pasando de unos 13.600 a finales de 2022 a 76.475 unidades de convivencia activa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 03:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un documental recoge testimonios sobre el deterioro de la sanidad pública andaluza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El documental “Salud No Responde”, dirigido por Pablo Coca e impulsado por el movimiento Marea Blanca, ofrece una radiografía del estado actual de la sanidad pública en Andalucía a través de testimonios directos de pacientes, profesionales sanitarios y activistas.

Lejos de depender exclusivamente de decisiones políticas o de la agenda climática, el despliegue de las energías limpias se ha convertido en un fenómeno estructural, impulsado por factores económicos, tecnológicos y financieros.

Según datos de BloombergNEF, en 2025 la inversión mundial en transición energética alcanzó un récord histórico de 2,3 billones de dólares, un 8% más que el año anterior, incluso en un contexto de tensiones geopolíticas, incertidumbre regulatoria y giros políticos adversos en Estados Unidos. Por segundo año consecutivo, la inversión en energías limpias superó a la destinada a combustibles fósiles, mientras que esta última cayó por primera vez desde 2020.

Este patrón meteorológico se debe a un debilitamiento del vórtice polar, una gran masa de aire frío sobre el Ártico que, al perder fuerza, provoca ondulaciones en la corriente en chorro. Estas ondulaciones, junto con un potente anticiclón situado entre Groenlandia e Islandia, actúan como un bloqueo que impide el paso habitual de los frentes por el norte de Europa y los desvía hacia latitudes más bajas, afectando directamente al sur de la península ibérica.

Estudios científicos, como los de la Universidad de Lisboa y la Unión Geofísica Americana, relacionan estos bloqueos en el Atlántico norte con un aumento de días húmedos en el suroeste de Europa, incluida España.

Aunque Hurd sigue estando por detrás del kernel Linux en términos de madurez y soporte de hardware, el panorama actual es más optimista que en años anteriores. Uno de los hitos más relevantes es la finalización práctica del puerto a x86_64, superando su tradicional limitación a arquitecturas de 32 bits. Además, el soporte SMP para sistemas multinúcleo, una carencia histórica del proyecto, ha mejorado de forma notable.

Otro aspecto clave es el progreso en controladores de hardware, impulsado en gran medida por el uso de la capa rump de NetBSD, que ha permitido reutilizar drivers existentes y ampliar la compatibilidad sin partir de cero.

En enero, el sistema eléctrico registró un sobrecoste de unos 105 millones de euros respecto al mismo mes del año anterior, elevando el gasto total en restricciones técnicas hasta los 335 millones. Este incremento está directamente relacionado con las medidas adoptadas tras el apagón de abril de 2025 para reforzar la seguridad del suministro y evitar nuevos episodios de tensión en la red.

El Gobierno, con el aval de la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), permitió a Red Eléctrica mantener durante un año ajustes operativos que inicialmente iban a ser temporales.

Además, más de la mitad de las mujeres protegidas, 53.716, tienen hijos o hijas a su cargo, lo que incrementa el riesgo y la complejidad de estas situaciones.

El sistema VioGén evalúa el nivel de riesgo al que se enfrentan las víctimas, desde bajo hasta extremo. Actualmente, 25 mujeres se encuentran en riesgo extremo, con peligro real para su vida, mientras que 953 están en riesgo alto y más de 14.500 en riesgo medio.

La medida permitía hasta diez días de ausencia al año sin necesidad de presentar un certificado médico, con la intención de reducir el estrés y las dificultades académicas asociadas a dolores menstruales severos. Para evitar cualquier tipo de estigmatización, la institución decidió abrir formalmente el dispositivo a todo el alumnado, independientemente de su género, basándolo en un principio de confianza.

Sin embargo, en los meses siguientes, el profesorado detectó un elevado número de ausencias injustificadas entre estudiantes varones de la escuela de ingeniería Ensil-Ensci. La investigación interna reveló que alrededor de cincuenta estudiantes hombres habían utilizado este permiso, acumulando cerca de cien días de ausencia en apenas tres meses.

La compañía invirtió decenas de millones de dólares en adquirir libros usados, principalmente de librerías de segunda mano y bibliotecas, cortándoles el lomo con máquinas hidráulicas, digitalizando sus páginas a alta velocidad y reciclando posteriormente los volúmenes físicos. Este método se presentó como una alternativa más ética a la descarga masiva de copias piratas desde sitios como LibGen, práctica que la propia empresa y otras como Meta, Google y OpenAI habían utilizado anteriormente, aunque con preocupaciones internas sobre su legalidad.

Según el texto, Epstein le confiesa a Peter Thiel que 'representa a los Rothschild' y busca invertir fondos bancarios en Palantir. Se menciona un contrato de 25 millones de dólares, conversaciones con Ariane de Rothschild (CEO del Grupo Edmond de Rothschild) sobre oportunidades tras el golpe en Ucrania en 2014, y sugerencias racistas de Epstein para excluir africanos de consejos asesores. Además, se vincula a Epstein con el Mossad y estrategias geopolíticas en Oriente Medio, como crear enemigos en varios países o supuesta ayuda estadounidense al ISIS.

Estos grupos comparten la explotación de los malestares de los jóvenes varones en un contexto de precariedad económica, crisis de vivienda y dificultades para emanciparse, cruzados con cambios en los roles de género impulsados por el feminismo. Alabao explica que estas comunidades ofrecen respuestas simplistas que culpan al feminismo y a las mujeres, proporcionando además un sentido de pertenencia. Destaca la brecha de género en las preferencias políticas: los jóvenes varones muestran mayor apoyo a derechas radicales y rechazo al feminismo, influido por el consumo masivo de contenido antifeminista online, el aislamiento post-pandemia y la falta de modelos alternativos de masculinidad.

Ya’alon reconoce que, en su momento, no comprendió plenamente estas advertencias y ahora admite que Leibowitz tenía razón.

La magistrada considera probado que el demandado publicó más de un centenar de tuits dirigidos a los padres, en los que utilizó expresiones claramente insultantes y vejatorias, calificándolos con numerosos descalificativos. Además, difundió afirmaciones sobre las circunstancias de la muerte de Kira cuya veracidad no quedó acreditada durante el procedimiento judicial.

El problema no se limita a una mala racha coyuntural, sino que responde a un modelo industrial altamente concentrado y dominado por grandes corporaciones.

Según estimaciones del propio sector, las pérdidas de los productores superan los 17.000 millones de dólares, pese a que algunos cortes de carne han subido hasta un 16 % y, en determinados periodos, incluso un 70 % en apenas unos meses. Esta subida no repercute en los ingresos de los criadores, que venden su ganado a precios cada vez más bajos.

Su intervención no será presencial, sino a través de una videollamada, en un acto que reunirá a diversas figuras vinculadas a la derecha y la ultraderecha internacional, entre ellas el presidente argentino Javier Milei.

La participación de Ayuso se produce en un contexto político especialmente delicado en Estados Unidos, marcado por la publicación de nueva información relacionada con los archivos del pederasta Jeffrey Epstein, que vuelven a salpicar directamente a Trump. Pese a ello, la presidenta madrileña intervendrá en un evento que se presenta como un foro para reforzar las alianzas económicas y políticas entre Estados Unidos y América Latina desde una óptica claramente conservadora.

Tras fracasar la vía diplomática para convencer a Reino Unido de mantener sus tropas, la inteligencia militar israelí (Aman), bajo el mando del coronel Binyamin Gibli, lanzó en 1954 la Operación Susannah. Esta consistió en una operación de falsa bandera: agentes reclutados en la Unidad 131, compuesta mayoritariamente por judíos egipcios, colocaron bombas de baja potencia en objetivos británicos y estadounidenses en El Cairo y Alejandría (oficinas postales, bibliotecas estadounidenses y teatros), con el fin de simular inestabilidad y atribuir los atentados a grupos como los Hermanos Musulmanes o comunistas, presionando así a los británicos para no evacuar la zona.

Los artefactos eran rudimentarios (bolsas de ácido que corroían y detonaban nitroglicerina), y causaron daños mínimos.

Estas impresionantes obras fueron creadas por los artistas alemanes Leopold Blaschka (1822-1895) y su hijo Rudolf Blaschka (1857-1939), expertos vidrieros que trabajaron durante más de cincuenta años, desde 1886 hasta 1936. En total, produjeron 4.300 modelos de vidrio que representan con gran precisión científica 780 especies de plantas, exclusivamente para Harvard.

La colección fue encargada por el profesor George Lincoln Goodale, director fundador del Museo Botánico de la universidad, y financiada por las benefactoras Mary Lee Ware y su madre Elizabeth. El objetivo principal era disponer de modelos tridimensionales duraderos y de color estable para la enseñanza de la botánica, en una época en la que preservar plantas reales resultaba complicado.

La publicación generó una fuerte polémica e indignación tanto de demócratas como de republicanos, incluido el senador Tim Scott, quien lo calificó como 'lo más racista que he visto en esta Casa Blanca' y pidió su eliminación inmediata. Inicialmente, la secretaria de prensa Karoline Leavitt defendió el contenido, argumentando que se trataba de un meme de internet inspirado en 'El Rey León' —con Trump como rey de la jungla— y tachó de 'falsa indignación' las críticas. Horas después, la Casa Blanca eliminó el video, atribuyendo la publicación a un 'error' de un miembro del personal no identificado.

Esta tendencia confirma que, pese a los compromisos climáticos asumidos en las últimas décadas, las emisiones globales de CO₂ continúan siendo demasiado elevadas como para frenar su acumulación en la atmósfera.

El CO₂ es el principal gas de efecto invernadero generado por la actividad humana y el mayor responsable del calentamiento global actual. Las mediciones realizadas en estaciones de referencia como el Observatorio de Mauna Loa, que registra datos desde 1958, muestran un aumento constante y sostenido de su concentración, impulsado sobre todo por la quema de combustibles fósiles, la industria y el uso intensivo de energía.

Lejos de ser simples curiosidades, estos problemas marcaron el desarrollo de la física moderna al obligar a revisar conceptos como entropía, irreversibilidad, información y tiempo.

El texto comienza con el demonio de Maxwell, un experimento mental que parecía permitir la violación de la segunda ley al crear orden sin gasto de energía. La resolución llegó al comprender que la información es física: medir, almacenar y borrar datos tiene un coste energético inevitable, formulado en el límite de Landauer. Al incluir al observador en el sistema, la entropía total vuelve a aumentar.

El autor sostiene que el PP ha actuado con hipocresía al acusar al PSOE de encubrir comportamientos reprobables mientras, al mismo tiempo, niega, minimiza o desacredita las denuncias cuando los señalados pertenecen a su partido.

El texto se centra especialmente en el caso del alcalde de Móstoles, figura cercana a Ayuso, acusado por una concejala de acoso sexual y laboral. Según el columnista, la respuesta del PP madrileño ha sido negar los hechos y amenazar judicialmente a la presunta víctima, una actitud que considera coherente con una estrategia histórica del partido: negar cualquier irregularidad, presentar las acusaciones como conspiraciones políticas y atacar a quien denuncia.

En su explotación sufre ataques frecuentes, con una media de quince caballos muertos al año, pero asegura que, con medidas adecuadas y compensaciones ágiles, la convivencia es posible.

El ganadero destaca que la regulación y el pago de indemnizaciones han mejorado notablemente en los últimos años, reduciendo la sensación de abandono que históricamente sufría el sector. Las ovejas y cabras, protegidas con perros y sistemas de control como GPS, apenas sufren ataques, mientras que los caballos, que pastan solos, son más vulnerables.

La propuesta busca acelerar su entrada en vigor y va más allá del mínimo exigido por la Unión Europea, introduciendo la reparabilidad como un elemento clave de la calidad esperable de un producto. En la práctica, si un bien no puede repararse, podría considerarse defectuoso, lo que supone un cambio relevante en la forma de entender la protección al consumidor.

Uno de los puntos centrales del borrador es el incentivo directo a la reparación frente a la sustitución. Los consumidores podrán elegir entre reparar o reemplazar un producto averiado, pero solo la opción de reparar conllevará una ampliación de los derechos de garantía. Concretamente, Alemania plantea extender un año adicional el plazo de reclamación si el usuario opta por arreglar el producto en lugar de cambiarlo por uno nuevo.

El protagonista, Eduardo Colina, alférez joven y abogado de formación, encarna esa posición intermedia entre la vida civil y el conflicto armado. Lejos de cualquier heroicidad, su mirada atenta a los detalles cotidianos —los gestos repetidos, los sonidos, los olores, las texturas— convierte la novela en una exploración del tiempo ordinario.

El punto de partida es el archivo British Cartoon Archive de la Universidad de Kent, que conserva 159 registros de viñetas etiquetadas con el nombre de Franco. Tras un proceso de depuración que elimina duplicidades, versiones repetidas y dibujos con menciones meramente anecdóticas, el autor del artículo identifica un total de 62 caricaturas en las que Franco aparece representado de forma directa y satírica. Estas imágenes se presentan en tres entregas, comenzando por las publicadas entre 1936 y 1939.

El texto se centra en las viñetas aparecidas principalmente en el diario Evening Standard, contextualizándolas cronológicamente y relacionándolas con los principales acontecimientos de la Guerra Civil y la política internacional europea.

El texto sostiene que estos archivos confirmarían antiguas teorías conspirativas y vincula a Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea, la OTAN y diversos gobiernos con una estructura criminal organizada.

El artículo centra parte de sus acusaciones en Kosovo, afirmando que grupos albaneses habrían actuado como intermediarios en el tráfico masivo de niños para satisfacer a élites occidentales, con el respaldo de la OTAN. También se mencionan supuestos casos históricos, como la sustracción de órganos durante la guerra de Yugoslavia, y se citan testimonios no verificados procedentes de fuentes rusas sobre crímenes similares en Ucrania.

Según el contenido de la misiva, Rodríguez defendió la actuación del Ejecutivo regional y negó que los conocidos como ‘protocolos de la vergüenza’ discriminaran a los mayores por razones ajenas a su situación clínica.

El artículo contextualiza estas cartas en un marco más amplio de denuncias y testimonios de familiares que relatan desprecios institucionales, falta de respuestas y una gestión que consideran injusta y dolorosa.

La medida llega tras los problemas de navegación sufridos durante el conflicto de junio de 2025, cuando se registraron fallos generalizados en las señales de posicionamiento que afectaron tanto a la aviación civil como a los activos militares iraníes. Este episodio puso de relieve la vulnerabilidad de depender de un sistema gestionado por una potencia rival.

BeiDou, operativo a escala global desde 2020, cuenta con una constelación de más de 50 satélites, frente a los aproximadamente 31 del GPS estadounidense. Esta mayor densidad, unida a una arquitectura que incluye satélites en órbitas geoestacionarias, ofrece una cobertura especialmente robusta en Asia y Oriente Medio, lo que resulta ventajoso para un país con una geografía compleja como Irán.

Según su testimonio, la propuesta se hizo de forma preventiva, con el objetivo de “curarse en salud” ante la evolución de los acontecimientos.

Martín Moratilla ha explicado que, una vez que el Centro de Coordinación Operativa Integrado (Cecopi) tuvo conocimiento del riesgo existente en la presa de Forata, se llegó a valorar la evacuación de los municipios potencialmente afectados.

Tras conocerse la deportación, el juez federal Richard G. Stearns calificó lo ocurrido como un error y dio al Gobierno la oportunidad de corregir la situación. En ese contexto, recomendó que se facilitara el regreso de la estudiante mediante la concesión de un visado de estudiante, con el objetivo de restablecer la situación previa a su expulsión y permitirle continuar con sus estudios universitarios.

El episodio se produjo en un contexto general festivo y animado, marcado por actuaciones musicales y una cuidada puesta en escena que buscaba reflejar tanto la vida urbana de Milán como el entorno montañoso de los Alpes italianos.

Los abucheos se escucharon principalmente al inicio del desfile de la delegación israelí en el estadio de Milán, aunque quedaron rápidamente amortiguados por la música ambiental de alto volumen. Los atletas, encabezados por la abanderada Mariia Seniuk, mantuvieron una actitud serena y continuaron su recorrido con la bandera nacional en alto. En otros escenarios paralelos, como Cortina d’Ampezzo y Predazzo, la recepción fue desigual: algunos aplausos en el primer caso y nuevos abucheos aislados en el segundo.

Enero cerró con una media de 119 litros por metro cuadrado, un 85% más de lo normal, convirtiéndose en el enero más lluvioso en 25 años. Este encadenamiento de temporales, que ha provocado evacuaciones, inundaciones y graves problemas de infraestructuras, está relacionado con cambios en la circulación atmosférica a gran escala.

Los meteorólogos apuntan a la corriente en chorro —un potente flujo de aire que rodea el hemisferio norte— como elemento clave para entender la situación. Habitualmente, esta corriente guía las borrascas atlánticas por latitudes más septentrionales, afectando sobre todo al norte de Europa. Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas se ha desplazado hacia el sur debido a un patrón atmosférico anómalo, con el anticiclón de las Azores situado mucho más al norte de lo habitual, entre Groenlandi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El gran problema del feminismo, Denuncias falsas de maltrato, Jóvenes fachas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo parece ser un debate o discusión sobre temas relacionados con el feminismo, con un enfoque en las denuncias falsas de maltrato y la aparición de movimientos juveniles con ideologías conservadoras.

Con un alcance estimado superior a los 1.000 kilómetros, este misil permite a Teherán influir en áreas que hasta ahora se consideraban relativamente seguras para la navegación militar estadounidense.

El Abu Mahdi es un misil de crucero subsónico propulsado por turborreactor, diseñado para vuelos prolongados y perfiles de ataque complejos. Su trayectoria combina fases a gran altitud, que optimizan el consumo de combustible, con un descenso final a vuelo rasante sobre la superficie del mar. Este perfil reduce de forma significativa la detección ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-misil-antibuque-abu-mahdi-amplia-el-alcance-ofensivo-irani-y-desafia-la-defensa-naval-en-el-mar-arabigo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-misil-antibuque-abu-mahdi-amplia-el-alcance-ofensivo-irani-y-desafia-la-defensa-naval-en-el-mar-arabigo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 06:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mensajes entre Bannon y Epstein revelan una estrategia de la ultraderecha para atacar al papa Francisco y reforzar a la extrema derecha europea]]></title><description><![CDATA[La desclasificación de nuevos documentos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein ha sacado a la luz mensajes intercambiados entre el financiero y Steve Bannon, exasesor de Donald Trump, que muestran con claridad dos de las grandes prioridades de la ultraderecha estadounidense durante el primer mandato de Trump. Por un lado, el intento de debilitar el pontificado del papa Francisco, visto como una amenaza ideológica por los sectores más conservadores del catolicismo en Estados Unidos; por otro, la financiación y coordinación de fuerzas populistas y de extrema derecha en Europa con el objetivo de erosionar la Unión Europea desde dentro.

En uno de los mensajes más llamativos, fechado en junio de 2019, Bannon escribe a Epstein que 'derribarán' al papa Francisco, al que equipara con otros grandes enemigos políticos y geoestratégicos como la UE, China o los Clinton. Estas palabras se producen en el contexto de una campaña más amplia contra el Pontífice, alimentada por su perfil reformista: defensa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mensajes-entre-bannon-y-epstein-revelan-una-estrategia-de-la-ultraderecha-para-atacar-al-papa-francisco-y-reforzar-a-la-extrema-derecha-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mensajes-entre-bannon-y-epstein-revelan-una-estrategia-de-la-ultraderecha-para-atacar-al-papa-francisco-y-reforzar-a-la-extrema-derecha-europea</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 05:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El maltrato animal en Roldán pone en evidencia la ineficacia de las leyes de protección animal]]></title><description><![CDATA[El caso de un perro maltratado en Roldán, Cartagena, ha generado indignación y preocupación entre las protectoras de animales de la región. El perro fue golpeado, metido en un saco y arrojado a la basura por su agresor. A pesar de las graves lesiones sufridas, el animal está mejorando, aunque las secuelas psicológicas serán permanentes. Las responsables de las protectoras denuncian la ineficacia de la legislación española en cuanto al maltrato animal, ya que el agresor acumulaba varias denuncias sin que se tomaran medidas contundentes. Este caso pone de manifiesto un problema estructural de empatía en la sociedad y la normalización de la violencia hacia los animales, reflejada también en los medios de comunicación. Las activistas insisten en que las leyes deben ser más estrictas y aplicarse con mayor firmeza, ya que quienes son capaces de hacer daño a los animales podrían también hacerlo a las personas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-maltrato-animal-en-roldan-pone-en-evidencia-la-ineficacia-de-las-leyes-de-proteccion-animal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-maltrato-animal-en-roldan-pone-en-evidencia-la-ineficacia-de-las-leyes-de-proteccion-animal</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 03:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alemania debate la prohibición de redes sociales para menores de 16 años]]></title><description><![CDATA[La CDU de Alemania está planteando prohibir el acceso a redes sociales a menores de 16 años, siguiendo una tendencia internacional. Argumentan que las plataformas digitales exponen a los jóvenes a contenido nocivo como el odio y la desinformación, y que los controles actuales son insuficientes. Este debate surge tras las preocupaciones sobre los efectos negativos de las redes sociales en los menores, como el ciberacoso y la violencia. La CDU de Schleswig-Holstein ha propuesto una moción para introducir una verificación obligatoria de edad. Este enfoque no es nuevo, ya que Australia ya tomó medidas similares, y Pedro Sánchez en España también ha mostrado interés en regular el acceso a las redes sociales en la misma línea. Si se aprueba la ley en Alemania, las plataformas deberán bloquear a los menores de 16 años, con posibles sanciones si no cumplen. La propuesta implica redefinir la forma en que se verifica la edad en internet y las responsabilidades de las plataformas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-debate-la-prohibicion-de-redes-sociales-para-menores-de-16-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-debate-la-prohibicion-de-redes-sociales-para-menores-de-16-anos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 02:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orígenes y desarrollo de los Boeing 747 LCF Dreamlifter]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Boeing 747 LCF, conocido como Dreamlifter, es un avión diseñado específicamente para transportar grandes componentes del Boeing 787 Dreamliner, reduciendo drásticamente los tiempos de transporte desde Japón hasta Estados Unidos. A principios de los años 2000, Boeing necesitaba trasladar grandes secciones del 787, fabricadas en colaboración con empresas japonesas e italianas, pero el transporte marítimo era lento y costoso. La solución fue modificar cuatro Boeing 747-400, ampliando su fuselaje central para acomodar estas piezas. El primer avión convertido realizó su vuelo inaugural en 2006 y la certificación por la FAA se obtuvo en 2007. Las cuatro unidades del programa provienen de aviones previamente operados por Air China, China Airlines y Malaysia Airlines, que fueron adquiridos por Boeing y posteriormente transformados por Evergreen International Airlines. Estas aeronaves siguen siendo esenciales para la logística del Dreamliner, y cuentan con equipos especializados, como el DBL]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/origenes-y-desarrollo-de-los-boeing-747-lcf-dreamlifter</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/origenes-y-desarrollo-de-los-boeing-747-lcf-dreamlifter</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 01:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CHA denuncia a una web por incitar odio contra las mujeres y cuestionar sus derechos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Chunta Aragonesista (CHA) ha llevado ante la Fiscalía unos panfletos difundidos en la página web wikiviogen.com, alegando que atentan contra las leyes de igualdad y promueven una cultura del odio hacia las mujeres.

Los intercambios, fechados principalmente entre 2018 y 2019, coinciden con el periodo en el que Bannon, ya fuera de la Casa Blanca, recorrió Europa con la intención de articular un frente ultraderechista y euroescéptico dentro del Parlamento Europeo.

En los mensajes, Bannon se muestra especialmente interesado en líderes como Matteo Salvini, entonces viceprimer ministro italiano y líder de la Liga, y Marine Le Pen en Francia. En uno de los textos, enviado en marzo de 2019, Bannon afirma estar “centrado en recaudar fondos para Le Pen y Salvini” de cara a las elecciones europeas celebradas en mayo de ese año.

Desde distintos niveles del partido, incluidos Alfonso Serrano, número dos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, y otros cargos, se han cuestionado públicamente la labor profesional de la denunciante y su lealtad al partido, llegando incluso a difundir bulos. La exedil había grabado conversaciones internas que evidenciaban que algunos dirigentes desaconsejaban denunciar el acoso y aludían al posible malestar en su familia. A pesar de que el PP cuenta con protocolos para casos de acoso, la respuesta oficial ha sido centrarse en desacreditar a la denunciante, defendiendo la actuación de los cargos implicados y la presunción de inocencia del alcalde.

La grabación, creada con inteligencia artificial, mostraba a Barack Obama y a su esposa, Michelle, con sus rostros superpuestos en cuerpos de monos, una representación ampliamente condenada por reproducir estereotipos racistas históricos. El vídeo formaba parte de una pieza de tono conspiranoico que insistía, sin pruebas, en la supuesta manipulación de las máquinas de votación de Dominion Voting Systems durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2020, en las que Joe Biden derrotó a Trump.

La publicación permaneció visible durante unas doce horas antes de ser retirada, una decisión poco habitual en Trump, que rara vez elimina contenidos polémicos.

La negativa se produjo en el último día de entrevistas antes de la jornada de reflexión, en un espacio de 15 minutos fijado por la Junta Electoral Central en función de los resultados obtenidos por el partido en los anteriores comicios.

Según explicó la propia Intxaurrondo al cierre del programa, Azcón decidió no acudir a la entrevista pese a que otros candidatos, como la socialista Pilar Alegría, sí participaron en el mismo formato. El programa matinal de La 1 y el Canal 24 Horas había organizado estas entrevistas siguiendo estrictamente los criterios legales de neutralidad y reparto de tiempos, ofreciendo a cada formación una ventana de visibilidad equivalente.

Aunque Starmer nunca conoció personalmente a Epstein, su decisión de nombrar a Mandelson como embajador del Reino Unido en Estados Unidos en 2024 —a pesar de estar al tanto de sus vínculos con Epstein— ha provocado fuertes críticas incluso dentro de su propio Partido Laborista. Documentos recientemente publicados muestran que Mandelson no solo mantuvo una relación con Epstein tras la condena de este último, sino que además podría haber compartido información sensible mientras ocupaba cargos políticos, lo que ha agravado aún más la situación. Starmer despidió finalmente a Mandelson en 2025 tras conocerse estas revelaciones y ha pedido disculpas públicas a las víctimas de Epstein por haber creído las declaraciones de Mandelson sobre la supues]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-escandalo-por-los-vinculos-de-un-exembajador-con-epstein-intensifica-la-presion-sobre-el-primer-ministro-britanico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-escandalo-por-los-vinculos-de-un-exembajador-con-epstein-intensifica-la-presion-sobre-el-primer-ministro-britanico</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 20:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alexander Soros respalda la política migratoria de Pedro Sánchez tras la regularización de inmigrantes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alexander Soros, hijo del filántropo y multimillonario George Soros, ha mostrado públicamente su apoyo al presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, tras la decisión del Ejecutivo de impulsar la regularización administrativa de cerca de medio millón de inmigrantes, una medida acordada con Podemos.

En su mensaje, Alexander Soros subraya que, frente a otros dirigentes que eluden los grandes retos, el presidente español opta por abordarlos de manera directa.

Imágenes de vigilancia revisadas por investigadores muestran una figura de color naranja subiendo por las escaleras hacia el módulo de celdas donde se encontraba Epstein alrededor de las 22:39, contradictorio con los informes oficiales que afirmaban que nadie había entrado en el área esa noche. Mientras que el FBI interpretó la figura como 'posiblemente un recluso', el informe de la Oficina del Inspector General indicó que podría tratarse de un funcionario de prisiones transportando ropa o sábanas. Estas discrepancias han generado debates sobre la cronología de los hechos y la supervisión de los guardias, ya que los registros muestran fallos en los conteos de presos y en los controles de bienestar de Epstein.

En lugar de responder al fondo de la cuestión, Serrano replicó con una frase personal y despectiva —“¿Y tú cómo ligas?”— que desvió el foco del asunto y generó críticas por su tono y falta de respeto.

La pregunta hacía referencia a la denuncia presentada por una exconcejala del Ayuntamiento de Móstoles, que acusa al alcalde de acoso laboral y sexual. Ante este contexto, Serrano no solo evitó valorar los hechos concretos, sino que defendió de manera cerrada a su partido y al regidor municipal. Durante la comparecencia, anunció además posibles acciones legales contra “cualquiera” que acuse al PP de encubrir un caso de acoso sexual, elevando el tono del enfrentamiento político.

La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid acudió al plató para valorar la actualidad política, con especial atención al accidente ferroviario de Adamuz, que había marcado el debate público en los últimos días. Durante la conversación, Ayuso aprovechó para cargar contra el ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, y para cuestionar la gestión del sistema ferroviario por parte del Gobierno central.

El momento más incómodo llegó cuando Ana Rosa Quintana le planteó una comparación directa entre el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, y la propia Ayuso. La periodista recordó que Sánchez había sido criticado por no acudir a un funeral en Huelva, mientras que a Ayuso también se le había reprochado haber promovido una misa en la Catedral de la Almudena el mismo día que se celebraba el funeral oficial al que asistieron los Reyes.

La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha advertido de precipitaciones muy abundantes en comunidades donde el suelo ya se encuentra saturado, lo que aumenta de forma significativa el riesgo de inundaciones y crecidas de ríos.

El contexto atmosférico viene marcado por un chorro polar especialmente activo y desplazado hacia latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, un patrón que está facilitando la llegada continua de borrascas desde el Atlántico. Este flujo dominante de vientos del oeste y suroeste arrastra aire muy húmedo, provocando lluvias persistentes y, en algunos momentos, de carácter intenso.

Desde diciembre, el país no recibe suministros regulares de gasolina y diésel, lo que ha provocado apagones prolongados, el colapso del transporte público y un aumento generalizado del malestar social. En La Habana, considerada una de las zonas menos afectadas, los cortes eléctricos alcanzan entre 12 y 14 horas diarias, mientras que en el oriente del país algunas provincias apenas disponen de seis horas de electricidad al día.

La falta de combustible ha obligado al Gobierno a racionar la venta de gasolina, que ahora se comercializa exclusivamente en dólares y con un límite estricto de 40 litros por usuario.

La autorización judicial se apoya en el funcionamiento técnico de Ace Stream, una plataforma basada en tecnología P2P similar a BitTorrent, en la que los usuarios no solo consumen el contenido, sino que también contribuyen a su distribución al actuar como pares dentro de la red. Según el auto, incluso de forma inconsciente, cada espectador puede formar parte del entramado técnico que facilita la difusión de contenidos no autorizados, lo que ha servido a LaLiga como argumento p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-permite-identificar-ips-por-ace-stream-pero-aclara-que-ver-futbol-pirata-no-implica-automaticamente-delito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-permite-identificar-ips-por-ace-stream-pero-aclara-que-ver-futbol-pirata-no-implica-automaticamente-delito</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detalles del DLC Poison Retro Set para Pixel Gun 3D en Epic Games Store]]></title><description><![CDATA[Poison Retro Set es un contenido descargable para el juego free to play Pixel Gun 3D que añade un conjunto de armas con estética retro y un potente efecto de veneno al arsenal del jugador.

Esta medida, tomada en el contexto de las crecientes tensiones en Gaza y la inestabilidad en el Medio Oriente, abarca sectores clave como la tecnología, infraestructura y bienes raíces. Beijing está tomando esta decisión debido a la incertidumbre sobre la seguridad de las inversiones en una región marcada por conflictos prolongados y amenazas de actores como Irán y Hezbollah. Las relaciones comerciales entre China e Israel se habían estrechado en la última década, especialmente en áreas como ciberseguridad, tecnología avanzada y agricultura.

El autor sostiene que la supuesta publicación masiva de millones de archivos vinculados a Epstein habría revelado una red global de abusos sexuales, chantaje y control político que implicaría a gran parte de las élites occidentales, incluidos dirigentes estadounidenses, empresarios tecnológicos y casas reales europeas. Según esta tesis, el escándalo habría provocado una crisis moral irreversible en Estados Unidos y en lo que denomina el “Occidente colectivo”.

El artículo afirma que Donald Trump habría utilizado inicialmente la promesa de desclasificar los archivos como arma electoral, para después intentar minimizar o encubrir su contenido, lo que habría generado una fractura interna en el movimiento MAGA.

En esas conversaciones privadas, mantenidas en la sede de la Vicepresidencia del Gobierno de Aragón durante el primer semestre de 2024, se plantea abiertamente la posibilidad de que el presidente autonómico, Jorge Azcón, pudiera recolocar a dirigentes de Vox en otras responsabilidades una vez abandonado el Ejecutivo.

En los audios, Nolasco pregunta de forma directa a su entorno de confianza si Azcón aceptaría colocar a personas afines “donde él quisiera”, recibiendo como respuesta que cualquier movimiento sería fruto de una negociación y no de una obediencia automática.

La noticia destaca que, mientras Abascal se presenta como un firme defensor de España, no dudó en mostrar simpatía hacia un magnate extranjero que critica al propio Gobierno español. Los usuarios de Twitter cuestionaron sus motivaciones y le acusaron de intentar ganar notoriedad internacional a costa de criticar a su propio país. La reacción de Abascal fue interpretada por muchos como un gesto de 'lamebotismo' hacia Musk, y varios tuiteros no tardaron en expresar su descontento con comentarios irónicos y críticos.

El interés norteamericano por ambos territorios se explica por razones estratégicas más que económicas, especialmente en el contexto de la Primera Guerra Mundial y la reciente apertura del Canal de Panamá, que incrementó el valor geopolítico del Caribe.

Las Islas Vírgenes, colonizadas sucesivamente por varias potencias europeas, pasaron a manos danesas en el siglo XVII y se integraron en un sistema colonial basado en plantaciones de azúcar sostenidas por mano de obra esclava. Tras la abolición de la esclavitud y el hundimiento de ese modelo económico, el archipiélago se convirtió en una carga para Dinamarca. Estados Unidos mostró interés desde mediados del siglo XIX, temiendo que otras potencias europeas, especialmente Alemania, se adelantaran en su control.

Según el análisis, la semana del 9 al 15 de febrero estará marcada por la continuidad de la llegada de borrascas atlánticas, lo que se traducirá en un episodio lluvioso en gran parte de la Península. Galicia será la comunidad más afectada por las precipitaciones, mientras que en el área mediterránea y en los archipiélagos las lluvias serán, en caso de producirse, más débiles y dispersas.

Además de las precipitaciones, esta primera semana destacará por unas temperaturas claramente superiores a la media habitual para esta época del año en la práctica totalidad del territorio peninsular, consolidando una tendencia de ambiente suave que ya se viene observando en semanas anteriores.

El texto, publicado en Menéame dentro de una comunidad gastronómica, reivindica la cocina popular y de subsistencia, destacando su valor cultural, emocional y culinario.

La autora explica la elaboración de los tortos desde una perspectiva práctica y doméstica, sin medidas exactas, siguiendo el método tradicional “a ojo”. Los ingredientes básicos son harina de maíz, agua tibia y sal, trabajados hasta lograr una textura similar a la plastilina. Se detallan trucos para conseguir una masa manejable, estirarla correctamente y darle forma uniforme antes de cocinarla directamente sobre la chapa, tal y como se hacía históricamente.

El acompañamiento, denominado coloquialmente “la chicha”, consiste en un sofrito de cebolla con rebozuelos, nueces para aportar textura, nata y queso azul, hasta obtener una salsa cremosa.

Mouliaá decidió retirar la denuncia por presunta agresión sexual contra Íñigo Errejón, algo que sorprendió a su abogado, quien había recomendado actuar de forma coherente. Arrién destacó las dificultades que vivió durante todo el proceso debido a la actitud de la actriz, que, según él, no siguió sus consejos y saboteó el procedimiento con sus decisiones impulsivas. Además, comentó que la Fiscalía probablemente archive el caso por la debilidad de las pruebas, ya que la retirada de la denuncia por parte de Mouliaá ha debilitado considerablemente el caso.

La ficción, compuesta por ocho capítulos, aborda de forma cruda y directa el auge de la extrema derecha y sus efectos sobre una democracia debilitada. La historia sigue a Salvador, un médico madrileño que se enfrenta a un drama personal cuando descubre que su hija Milena, gravemente herida en una pelea entre hinchas de fútbol, forma parte de un grupo neonazi llamado White Souls. La serie no solo expone la violencia y la injusticia que rodea a este fenómeno político, sino que también invita al espectador a reflexionar sobre las causas que llevan a personas aparentemente pacíficas a adoptar ideas extremistas. La producción combina escenas de acción trepidantes con un análisis profundo de la polarización social, mostrando cómo el descontento y la frustración pueden ser aprovechados por ideologías radicales.

Desde 2008, la organización ha atendido a más de 10.000 mujeres y niñas mediante un proyecto que combina prevención, acompañamiento y atención integral, así como formación de profesionales sanitarios para la detección temprana de situaciones de riesgo. El proyecto también fomenta redes comunitarias lideradas por mujeres, como Flor de África, y grupos de jóvenes afrodescendientes, fortaleciendo su papel como agentes de cambio. La erradicación de la MGF se considera un desafío que requiere intervención comunitaria, implicación institucional y enfoque en los derechos humanos, incluyendo la reconstrucción genital y atención emocional.

Estudios recientes sobre el Parque Solar de Talatan en la meseta tibetana muestran que la instalación de paneles fotovoltaicos ha creado un microclima que protege el suelo, retiene la humedad, reduce la erosión y favorece la vegetación. Tras más de una década de funcionamiento, se ha observado un aumento del 81,4% en la fijación de arena, del 71,1% en captura de carbono, del 32,1% en retención del suelo y del 5,4% en conservación de agua. Los paneles actúan como barreras contra el viento y sombra para el suelo, permitiendo que las semillas germinen y crezcan donde antes no era posible. Esta restauración genera beneficios ecológicos que incluso se extienden más allá del perímetro de la planta. Sin embargo, los estudios destacan una desigualdad ecológica: las zonas dentro del parque son mucho más fértiles que el desierto circundante.

Mientras Wakeman llevó al extremo el uso del teclado en el rock progresivo, mostrando la capacidad narrativa de los instrumentos, De Ville ofrece una visión más moderna, utilizando el violín eléctrico para crear una pieza que fusiona riffs y melodías tensas. A través de estos dos ejemplos, se demuestra cómo el rock instrumental ha evolucionado desde su apogeo en los años 70, adaptándose a la era digital y al formato de escucha fragmentada actual, sin perder su esencia ni su poder expresivo.

Tras el impacto, que a simple vista no parece especialmente violento, la batería del vehículo quedó dañada y comenzó a generar humo rápidamente. El conductor logró salir del coche, pero no pudo abrir las puertas traseras para rescatar a los otros ocupantes debido a que los tiradores ocultos no se desplegaban.

La presidenta ha señalado que la tauromaquia vive un “momento especial” en España, destacando el creciente interés de la juventud, a la que atribuye la búsqueda de autenticidad frente a lo que considera intentos de limitar determinadas tradiciones culturales. En este contexto, ha remarcado que el Gobierno regional continuará apoyando y fomentando los festejos taurinos, manteniendo a Madrid como “la gran casa de la tauromaquia” al servicio del conjunto del país.

Tras el escándalo protagonizado por el equipo de Noruega en el Mundial de Trondheim de 2025, donde se comprobó que varios deportistas alteraron sus trajes para ganar estabilidad y sustentación en el aire, el organismo endureció su normativa y adoptó una política de tolerancia cero frente a cualquier modificación.

En ese contexto, la FIS introdujo controles más estrictos, entre ellos la medición con escáneres 3D de la zona genital de los saltadores. Estas mediciones sirven como referencia para diseñar trajes ajustados a la morfología de cada deportista, con el objetivo de evitar prendas excesivamente holgadas o tensadas que puedan proporcionar ventajas ilegítimas durante el vuelo.

Según el investigador J. M. Ciordia, los templos clásicos no serían una creación puramente abstracta o simbólica, sino la petrificación en piedra de barcos de guerra o mercantes utilizados originalmente como refugio y techumbre. La hipótesis sostiene que elementos clave del templo, como el entablamento, los frisos con triglifos y metopas o incluso la curvatura del conjunto, derivan directamente de la estructura y el diseño de las galeras griegas.

La investigación combina arquitectura, arqueología naval, lingüística y etnografía. Uno de los puntos de partida es la similitud entre los términos griegos naus (barco) y naos (templo), cuya coincidencia formal habría sido ignorada hasta ahora por falta de una conexión material clara entre ambos conceptos.

Entre los arrestados se encuentran un notario, dos abogados que representaban legalmente a la víctima, su cuidadora y el comprador de los inmuebles. La investigación estima que los beneficios obtenidos por estas operaciones fraudulentas ascienden a unos 785.000 euros.

Según la investigación judicial, los implicados se aprovecharon de la situación de extrema vulnerabilidad de la anciana para vender todos sus bienes inmuebles en un periodo de poco más de un año, a precios muy inferiores a su valor real. Las compraventas se realizaron siempre ante el mismo notario y con el asesoramiento de los dos abogados, que incurrían en un claro conflicto de intereses al representar simultáneamente a la vendedora y a la parte compradora.

Bautista compareció ante los medios defendiendo su continuidad en el cargo y apelando a la presunción de inocencia, asegurando que seguirá trabajando por respeto a los vecinos del municipio.

El regidor sostiene que la denuncia fue investigada internamente por el PP entre octubre de 2024 y abril de 2025 y que el expediente fue archivado al no encontrarse pruebas que acreditaran los hechos. Además, subraya que la exconcejala no recurrió esa decisión ni acudió posteriormente a la vía judicial, argumento que utiliza para afirmar que no sabe de qué debe defenderse.

La investigación, publicada en la revista Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy y desarrollada en el marco de una tesis doctoral, se centra principalmente en el hepatocarcinoma, el cáncer de hígado más frecuente en adultos, aunque también analiza modelos de colangiocarcinoma y cáncer de colon.

Trabajos previos ya habían demostrado que SLU7 es esencial para el correcto funcionamiento de los hepatocitos sanos y que sus niveles disminuyen a medida que progresa la enfermedad hepática. Sin embargo, este nuevo estudio revela una paradoja relevante: aunque SLU7 se reduce durante la evolución de la enfermedad, las células tumorales conservan una cantidad mínima de esta proteína que resulta imprescindible para su supervivencia.

La decisión se enmarca en una estrategia nacional de tolerancia cero frente a los crímenes cometidos contra menores, que sitúa la integridad física y psicológica de la infancia como un valor prioritario del Estado.

Según explica, miles de ancianos murieron sin ser trasladados a hospitales, no por criterios médicos individualizados, sino por protocolos que excluían a residentes con alta dependencia o deterioro cognitivo.

El jet, un Gulfstream de 16 plazas, fue empleado al menos en dos vuelos recientes, en enero y febrero, trasladando a varios hombres palestinos desde un centro de detención en Arizona hasta Tel Aviv, con escalas técnicas en Estados Unidos y Europa.

Según el reportaje, los deportados viajaron esposados y con grilletes en tobillos y muñecas durante un trayecto de más de 12 horas.

Entre las voces críticas destacan Ana Pilar González del Cacho, actual jefa de gabinete de la presidenta de las Cortes aragonesas, y Alejandro Nolasco, por entonces vicepresidente del Gobierno autonómico y hoy candidato de Vox. En las conversaciones, González del Cacho llega a afirmar que Abascal 'no tiene ni puta idea' y 'es un puto basto', amenazando incluso con desafiliarse si se mantenía la línea política nacional.

José, tras ganar una oposición en Ibiza, tuvo que renunciar a ocupar su plaza porque no podía afrontar los costes de una vivienda local. Dolma, separada y con hijos, tuvo que trasladarse a Villena, Alicante, para poder adquirir una casa a un precio asequible. Según expertos, el 60% del salario familiar se destina al alquiler en Baleares, cifra que supera ampliamente la media nacional y provoca exclusión social y desigualdad.

La canción recuerda las lecciones del pasado, tomando como referencia el poema de Martin Niemöller, y llama a plantar cara a las injusticias.

En declaraciones realizadas en el programa 'Meet the Press' de NBC, Khanna reconoció que la divulgación reciente es significativa, pero subrayó que no cumple con el compromiso de hacer públicos todos los archivos del caso. Según explicó, el Departamento de Justicia ha identificado más de seis millones de documentos, pero tras un proceso de revisión y censura solo ha liberado alrededor de 3,5 millones.

Khanna, junto con el congresista republicano Thomas Massie, ha advertido de que, si no se publican los archivos restantes, están dispuestos a impulsar procedimientos de impeachment o declarar en desacato a la fiscal general, Pam Bondi.

La obra, esculpida por el artista Alan Cottrill en Ohio, se instalará en el Trump National Doral, cerca de Miami, sede de la Cumbre del G20 que acogerá Estados Unidos los días 14 y 15 de diciembre de 2026. El objetivo principal del proyecto es promocionar el memecoin $PATRIOT. La estatua representa a Trump con el puño en alto, inspirada en una imagen tras el intento de asesinato en Butler (Pensilvania) en julio de 2024, y los encargadores pidieron al escultor 'mejorar' el aspecto del presidente, eliminando el 'cuello de pavo' y adelgazándolo para que parezca más joven. Sin embargo, existe una disputa: Cottrill retiene la pieza en su fundición porque los inversores le deben 90.000 dólares de los 150.000 acordados, alegando que usaron ilegalmente imágenes de su trabajo para promocionar la criptomoneda, cuyo valo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estatua-dorada-de-trump-de-7-metros-financiada-por-inversores-en-criptomonedas-para-promocionar-memecoin-en-el-trump-national-doral-durante-el-g20</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estatua-dorada-de-trump-de-7-metros-financiada-por-inversores-en-criptomonedas-para-promocionar-memecoin-en-el-trump-national-doral-durante-el-g20</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mensajes de Epstein revelan los esfuerzos de Steve Bannon por financiar a partidos de extrema derecha en Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los archivos recientemente publicados de Jeffrey Epstein han revelado detalles sobre los intentos del exasesor de Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, de influir en la política europea a través de apoyo financiero a partidos de extrema derecha. Los mensajes, fechados principalmente entre 2018 y 2019, muestran a Bannon buscando el respaldo de Epstein para fortalecer a líderes como Matteo Salvini en Italia y Marine Le Pen en Francia, así como para promover el crecimiento de fuerzas ultraderechistas en Alemania, Polonia, Suecia y Austria. En algunos correos se evidencia que Bannon viajaba por Europa con la intención de unir a estos grupos en un movimiento euroescéptico. No hay evidencia de que Salvini tuviera relación directa con Epstein ni participación en su red de tráfico sexual, aunque su nombre aparece varias veces en los intercambios. En Francia, correos también mencionan a figuras como Jack Lang y su hija Caroline, vinculadas a proyectos artísticos con Epstein, sin indicios de ilegalidad.

Esta zona, aislada durante siglos por montañas escarpadas y su estructura de clanes patrilineales, presenta una notable preservación genética única en Europa continental.

Los resultados muestran que alrededor del 80 % de los linajes paternos pertenecen al haplogrupo J-M172 (específicamente subclados como J-L930), común en la antigüedad griega pero poco frecuente en otras partes de Europa actual. Muchos de estos linajes se remontan a un ancestro común del siglo VII a.C., lo que indica episodios graves de reducción demográfica por epidemias, guerras e inestabilidad política a lo largo de la historia.

Por el lado materno (ADN mitocondrial), se detectan al menos 30 linajes diferentes procedentes de áreas cercanas, lo que sugiere contactos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-genetico-confirma-la-continuidad-ancestral-desde-la-edad-del-bronce-en-la-poblacion-aislada-de-deep-mani-grecia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-genetico-confirma-la-continuidad-ancestral-desde-la-edad-del-bronce-en-la-poblacion-aislada-de-deep-mani-grecia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Presidente del Gobierno español Pedro Sánchez sobre el rearme de Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra una entrevista con el Presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, donde aborda temas relacionados con el rearme de Europa, la situación geopolítica actual, la guerra en Ucrania, la necesidad de inversión en defensa, y el papel de España en el contexto europeo y global.

La sentencia, dictada por la sala de lo contencioso-administrativo, respalda el criterio de la Agencia Tributaria y concluye que el holding del cineasta intentó compensar de forma indebida las pérdidas de una empresa integrada en el grupo, lo que suponía un doble aprovechamiento fiscal no permitido por la normativa.

El caso se remonta a una inspección iniciada en 2013 sobre AE William Holding, conglomerado que agrupa varias sociedades vinculadas a la actividad cinematográfica de Segura, entre ellas Amiguetes Entertainment, productora de la saga Torrente.

Según las primeras informaciones, las jóvenes se encontraban muy afectadas después de que sus padres les hubieran retirado el teléfono móvil. De acuerdo con la reconstrucción inicial, las hermanas se habrían encerrado en el balcón del domicilio familiar antes de precipitarse al vacío. Los gritos alertaron a los padres y a algunos vecinos del edificio, pero cuando lograron acceder al balcón ya no pudieron evitar el desenlace.

El nivel del agua ha alcanzado los 1,8 metros sobre el nivel del mar y continúa aumentando a un ritmo acelerado, con previsiones de superar los 1,9 metros en las próximas horas, lo que está unificando grandes áreas en una única lámina de agua de unas 30.000 hectáreas.

Desde el punto de vista ecológico, este episodio tiene efectos mayoritariamente positivos a corto plazo.

Utilizando la técnica DIPA-CRISPR, desarrollada previamente por el mismo grupo en 2022 para inactivar genes mediante inyección en el abdomen de la hembra, los investigadores han realizado una inserción (knock-in) fusionando el gen distal-less (clave en el desarrollo embrionario) con el marcador fluorescente rojo mCherry. Esta modificación se ha logrado con éxito en alrededor del 30 % de las hembras inyectadas, permitiendo observar en vivo y en tiempo real la expresión de la proteína Dll en apéndices y sistema nervioso durante el desarrollo embrionario, sin alterar el crecimiento normal del insecto.

Esta megaestructura consiste en un anillo artificial construido alrededor de una estrella, con un radio similar a la órbita terrestre y una superficie habitable millones de veces mayor que la de la Tierra. Aunque la idea fascinó a lectores y científicos, pronto generó críticas técnicas, especialmente tras la publicación de la novela en 1970.

El principal problema señalado es la inestabilidad gravitatoria inherente a un anillo orbital de este tipo. A diferencia de una órbita planetaria, el equilibrio del anillo es inestable: cualquier perturbación mínima —ya sea una asimetría estructural, el impacto de un meteorito o la influencia gravitatoria de otros cuerpos— tendería a crecer hasta provocar la colisión del anillo con la estrella central. Mantenerlo centrado sería tan difícil como equilibrar un lápiz sobre su punta.

En la actualidad, su valor ha caído por debajo de los 71.000 dólares, situándose incluso por debajo del precio que tenía antes de que Trump regresara a la presidencia.

Las pérdidas se han acelerado recientemente: un 8% en un solo día, un 20% en una semana y casi la mitad de su valor en el último trimestre.

Según expone el sindicato MATS, la central de esterilización está actualmente gestionada por la empresa Croma Servicios y Productos, tras la externalización del servicio. Diversos documentos internos indicarían que esta empresa estaría esterilizando material de la compañía privada Sanitas utilizando las instalaciones públicas del hospital madrileño.

Por su parte, la Moncloa defiende la ley como un mecanismo para garantizar la transparencia en la moderación de contenidos y proteger a los menores frente a la manipulación algorítmica, señalando además los problemas legales previos de Telegram en Francia debido a la falta de moderación. La Comisión Europea ha aclarado que no corresponde responsabilizar a los CEO de las plataformas y recuerda que la Ley de Servicios Digitales de la UE busca armonizar la protección de los menores de edad.

El autor sostiene que estas plataformas ya no cumplen ninguna función social positiva sin estar contaminada por vigilancia masiva, manipulación algorítmica y polarización deliberada. Lejos de conectar a las personas o fortalecer la democracia, se han convertido en sistemas de extracción de datos al servicio de intereses económicos colosales.

Dans apoya su argumentación en estudios que sitúan a Facebook, Instagram y otras aplicaciones de Meta entre las más invasivas en términos de recopilación y compartición de datos, subrayando que este saqueo no es un efecto secundario, sino el núcleo del negocio.

La traducción de Rodrigo Guijarro Lasheras y su estudio justifican por sí solos la edición de KRK, destacando la complejidad y ambición de la obra. Crumey, físico teórico y matemático, utiliza recursos postmodernos, intertextualidad y narración múltiple, y su literatura mezcla ciencia, música, filosofía y literatura, creando un diálogo sutil entre el texto y la experiencia del lector. La reseña enfatiza que el valor de la novela no reside únicamente en la historia o los personajes, sino en cómo plantea la realidad como una narrativa postmoderna y cómo combina elementos de física cuántica, distopía y literatura clásica. Además, se contextualiza su obra dentro del panorama editorial español, señalando interrupciones en la publicación de sus siguientes novelas y destacando la importancia de contar con traductores competentes.

En diciembre, la presidenta madrileña reprochó a la izquierda la falta de contundencia ante acusaciones de acoso, utilizando el caso Salazar para acusar al PSOE de no proteger a las mujeres y de normalizar conductas machistas en su entorno político.

Sin embargo, cuando una edil del PP de Móstoles denunció haber sufrido acoso sexual y laboral por parte del alcalde del municipio, Manuel Bautista, Ayuso no la recibió ni respondió a sus escritos, a pesar de que la concejala intentó durante meses obtener su apoyo. En lugar de ello, la presidenta sí citó al alcalde denunciado pocos días después de conocer los hechos.

La polémica surge al conocerse que la madre de sus dos hijas es beneficiaria de uno de los pisos de la primera promoción de vivienda protegida construida en la ciudad en los últimos 20 años, ubicada en un solar municipal especialmente cotizado, cercano a la playa de San Juan y dotado de servicios como piscina y pistas de pádel.

Las viviendas, un total de 140, fueron adjudicadas a un precio medio de 215.000 euros, aproximadamente la mitad de su valor de mercado, lo que ha generado una fuerte controversia política y social.

El juez analiza de forma individualizada las cuatro faltas imputadas y pone especial énfasis en la ocurrida el 29 de noviembre de 2024, cuando la trabajadora tuvo que acudir de urgencia al veterinario ante el empeoramiento crítico del estado de salud de su animal, al que finalmente se le practicó la eutanasia.

Las autoridades han organizado un desalojo escalonado y han trasladado a los vecinos a alojamientos provisionales.

Dicha conversación, que incluía referencias a presuntas cuentas bancarias y diálogos atribuidos al expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, fue negada rotundamente por ambas partes implicadas y nunca tuvo lugar.

Originalmente, 'facha' proviene de 'fascista', un concepto político que surgió en la Italia de Mussolini a comienzos del siglo XX. El fascismo fue un movimiento autoritario, ultranacionalista y totalitario que negaba las libertades individuales, controlaba todos los ámbitos de la sociedad y normalizaba la violencia como herramienta política. Reducir esta palabra a un insulto cotidiano empobrece el debate, pues hace difícil identificar comportamientos autoritarios reales. La noticia invita a la reflexión personal mediante un cuestionario sobre actitudes autoritarias, destacando que la verdadera esencia del fascismo va mucho más allá de una simple discrepancia política.

Además, Feijóo vinculó irónicamente la publicación de la noticia con la campaña electoral en Aragón y con la comparecencia del exasesor de Pedro Sánchez, Francisco Salazar, también acusado de acoso, subrayando diferencias en los tiempos y en la gestión de las denuncias. El líder popular defendió que, según los Estatutos del partido, la investigación en Madrid se realizó de manera veraz, se notificó a las personas implicadas y se remitió al Comité de Derechos y Garantías para su seguimiento.

A pesar de haber participado en varias reuniones con responsables del caso, incluido Alfonso Serrano y la vicepresidenta de la Asamblea, Ana Millán, sus denuncias no recibieron respuesta ni amparo por parte de la organización.

Aunque las llamadas comerciales sin consentimiento ya estaban prohibidas, aún se permitían en ciertos casos, como cuando el usuario había aceptado recibirlas o había sido cliente en los últimos 12 meses, siempre que no estuviera inscrito en listas de exclusión publicitaria. Ahora, además, estas llamadas solo podrán originarse desde números que comiencen por el prefijo 400, lo que permitirá identificarlas fácilmente y, si se desea, bloquearlas.

Inicialmente, la compañía buscaba limitar su impugnación a los programas de obuses ATP Ruedas y ATP Cadenas, pero el Tribunal Supremo ha extendido la demanda para incluir a otras entidades beneficiarias de créditos, como filiales de Telefónica, debido a la ausencia de dictamen del Consejo de Estado, un requisito no vinculante pero necesario según la ley.

Los tuiteros señalaron que, pese a un Gobierno progresista, España no presenta cambios ni medidas tan radicales como sugiere el artículo, e incluso bromean con la desproporción de la crítica. La noticia también destaca la disparidad entre la atención mediática sobre las supuestas políticas de Sánchez y otros líderes españoles como Feijóo, Ayuso o Abascal, quienes han protagonizado episodios mediáticos llamativos por distintos motivos, desde lapsus verbales hasta polémicas en actos públicos.

Desde una perspectiva académica y comparativa, se argumenta que el franquismo ofrece un marco histórico útil para comprender cómo se consolidan los sistemas autoritarios más allá de los modelos clásicos asociados al nazismo.

El texto repasa el ascenso del franquismo a partir de un contexto de crisis económica y política, el papel central del nacionalismo excluyente, la alianza con la Iglesia católica y la utilización del miedo al 'enemigo interno' para justificar la represión. Se subraya cómo el régimen debilitó la resistencia social mediante el control de los cuerpos, especialmente de las mujeres, restringiendo derechos reproductivos y reforzando roles tradicionales como parte de una estrategia de reproducción ideológica.

En aquel momento, Podemos había irrumpido con fuerza en el Congreso con 69 escaños y más del 20% de los votos, mientras Ciudadanos también obtenía relevancia pero sin capacidad para pactos mayoritarios con el PP o PSOE. El informe del banco alemán detallaba cuatro posibles escenarios: una investidura de Pedro Sánchez con el apoyo de Podemos y los nacionalistas, un acuerdo entre PSOE, Podemos y Ciudadanos, un pacto entre PSOE, PP y Ciudadanos, o elecciones anticipadas.

Los resultados principales indican que un mayor consumo acumulado de cannabis se asocia de forma general con volúmenes mayores en varias regiones cerebrales clave (especialmente aquellas con alta densidad de receptores CB1, como el hipocampo) y con un mejor desempeño en pruebas cognitivas relacionadas con memoria, aprendizaje, velocidad de procesamiento, atención y funciones ejecutivas.

A través del lenguaje visual y del humor, la pieza reflexiona sobre los mecanismos de manipulación de la opinión pública en el contexto actual, marcado por el auge de la ultraderecha, la centralidad de las redes sociales y el poder creciente de grandes plataformas digitales.

La ilustración apunta de manera directa a figuras y dinámicas reconocibles del debate público contemporáneo, como el papel de líderes políticos de la ultraderecha —entre ellos Santiago Abascal— y la influencia de magnates tecnológicos como Elon Musk en el ecosistema informativo. La viñeta sugiere cómo discursos simplificados, emocionalmente cargados y amplificados algorítmicamente pueden moldear percepciones colectivas, desplazar debates complejos y normalizar marcos ideológicos extremos.

Quiles, conocido por perseguir a cargos públicos con preguntas provocadoras fuera de contextos informativos convencionales, increpó a Iglesias en plena calle utilizando argumentos habituales de la extrema derecha, como la teoría del “gran reemplazo”, y ataques personales relacionados con su trayectoria política y profesional.

Durante el encuentro, Quiles lanzó preguntas sobre supuestas declaraciones de Irene Montero y sobre el futuro político de Iglesias, insistiendo en un tono provocador mientras grababa la escena para difundirla posteriormente en redes sociales. Ante esta situación, Iglesias respondió de forma airada, calificando a Quiles de “fascista” y “cerdo”, e intentando apartar el micrófono del canal Estado de Alarma, medio vinculado a Javier Negre.

Sin embargo, la interpretación resultó ser incorrecta y rápidamente llamó la atención de quienes conocen mínimamente la geografía gaditana.

El Puente Carranza no es una autovía urbana, sino la carretera CA-36, con un carril por sentido y otro reversible, y atraviesa directamente la Bahía de Cádiz. Al estar construido sobre el mar, no existen cunetas ni márgenes terrestres que puedan inundarse: los laterales y la parte inferior del puente están permanentemente rodeados de agua salada.

Según la versión de Serrano, la denunciante trasladó inicialmente al partido un escrito en febrero de 2024 en el que hablaba exclusivamente de discriminaciones laborales. En una reunión posterior, la dirección del PP le preguntó expresamente si estaba denunciando acoso o abuso sexual, a lo que ella habría respondido negativamente.

El proyecto surge de años de trabajo comunitario y de apoyo mutuo en el barrio, donde el problema de la vivienda se identificó como el principal factor de precariedad.

El autor no idealiza el pasado, pero defiende que crecer en un entorno imperfecto enseñaba a desarrollar criterio, instinto y resiliencia, algo que considera en peligro con las políticas de “riesgo cero”.

Arjona cuestiona que la prohibición sea una medida de salud pública basada en evidencias sólidas. Apoyándose en estudios recientes y en las tesis del psiquiatra Sami Timimi, sostiene que existe una tendencia a simplificar problemas complejos mediante soluciones rápidas y efectistas, lo que denomina la “McDonaldización de la salud mental”.

La obra, de grandes dimensiones, había perdido su rastro durante décadas y su localización se produjo en el marco de una investigación iniciada tras detectarse una pintura cuyo paradero no estaba claro durante una exposición organizada por la propia Casa de Alba entre 2023 y 2024.

El motivo principal es que el ponente designado para evaluar los suplicatorios del juez Pablo Llarena pertenecía al mismo grupo político que Vox, partido que ejerció la acusación popular en el juicio por el procés y el 1-O. El TJUE considera que esta circunstancia vulneró el derecho a un tratamiento imparcial y equitativo, ya que se incumplió la regla interna del Parlamento de evitar ponentes con afinidades políticas que puedan generar dudas legítimas sobre su neutralidad. El fallo corrige la sentencia previa del Tribunal General de la UE, que había avalado la retirada de inmunidad, y contradice también la propuesta del abogado general Maciej Szpunar, quien recomendaba rechazar los recursos.

El texto sostiene que dichos documentos describen una red de abusos sexuales sistemáticos, violencia extrema y chantaje que afectaría a sectores muy amplios de las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas de Occidente. Según el autor, existirían evidencias fotográficas y audiovisuales de torturas y abusos, así como correos electrónicos en los que Epstein y sus contactos aludirían a prácticas criminales graves, incluidas amenazas de muerte.

El artículo afirma que las víctimas de la red de Epstein podrían ascender a más de un millar de menores y subraya que las autoridades judiciales y policiales habrían conocido estos hechos desde los años noventa, sin actuar en consecuencia. Se menciona el caso de Maria Farmer, denunciante temprana que habría sido ignorada y posteriormente desacreditada.

Este resultado, que ha despertado un enorme interés científico y social, abre la puerta a futuros ensayos clínicos en humanos, previstos dentro de dos o tres años. Sin embargo, el principal obstáculo para dar ese paso es la falta de financiación suficiente.

El coste mínimo estimado para iniciar los ensayos clínicos en humanos asciende a unos 30 millones de euros, una cantidad que no está cubierta por los actuales Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Aunque el CNIO recibió en 2023 un total de 36,5 millones de euros en subvenciones públicas, estos fondos se destinan a la actividad global del centro, que desarrolla decenas de proyectos simultáneos, y no de forma exclusiva al estudio de Barbacid.

Según los documentos difundidos, Gil-Casares intercambió correos electrónicos y mensajes con Epstein desde 2017 hasta pocos meses antes de la muerte de este en agosto de 2019.

La alerta surgió cuando vecinos detectaron una antena parabólica de dos metros en el jardín de un apartamento alquilado por Airbnb, que interfería con la señal de internet del vecindario. La policía francesa investigó el lugar y halló un complejo sistema tecnológico que permitía interceptar datos satelitales, incluyendo información de la red Starlink, utilizada en comunicaciones críticas y posibles aplicaciones militares. Cuatro hombres de nacionalidad china fueron detenidos, acusados de delitos relacionados con la ciberdelincuencia y el suministro de información a una potencia extranjera.

Destaca cómo Uclés, pese a su éxito y proyección, ha decidido boicotear unas jornadas sobre la Guerra Civil organizadas por Arturo Pérez-Reverte, tituladas '1936. La guerra que todos perdimos'. Uclés se niega a compartir cartel con figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a quienes considera inadecuados, y rechaza el lema del evento por considerarlo falso y complaciente con la derecha revisionista, ya que argumenta que la guerra no la perdieron todos, sino que la ganaron los franquistas y la sufrieron especialmente los republicanos.

Lo que debía haber sido un momento de celebración se vio empañado por una oleada de insultos y ataques personales en redes sociales, motivados por el idioma que utilizó en una entrevista posterior a la competición. Delago habló en ladino, su lengua materna, durante una conversación con RAI Ladinia, el canal público italiano que emite íntegramente en este idioma.

Los comentarios ofensivos, lanzados principalmente por usuarios anónimos o los llamados “leones de teclado”, incluían mensajes como “si representas a Italia, habla italiano” o insultos de carácter xenófobo. Estas reacciones generaron un debate público sobre la diversidad lingüística en Italia y el derecho a utilizar lenguas minoritarias en espacios mediáticos y deportivos.

Inicialmente, Bezos mantuvo la independencia editorial y permitió que el medio realizara un periodismo crítico y de calidad, convirtiéndose en un referente durante la presidencia de Donald Trump. Sin embargo, con el tiempo, intervenciones directas en decisiones editoriales y cambios estratégicos destinados a la rentabilidad llevaron a despidos masivos y a la eliminación de secciones clave como noticias locales, deportes y corresponsalías internacionales. La publicación perdió suscriptores y buena parte de su identidad como periódico independiente y local. El artículo destaca la paradoja de que, a pesar de contar con una fortuna personal colosal, Bezos optó por sacrificar la esencia del medio en lugar de asumir pérdidas económicas, lo que contrasta con la dedicación de históricos magnates de la prensa como William Randolph Hearst.

En lugar de centrarse en cuestiones de competencia, Hawley dedicó buena parte de su turno a atacar el contenido de la plataforma, especialmente la presencia de personajes y temáticas trans en programas dirigidos al público infantil.

Hawley acusó a Netflix de promover lo que denominó una “ideología transgénero”, llegando a afirmar, sin aportar pruebas, que casi la mitad de los contenidos infantiles de la plataforma impulsan esta supuesta agenda. El codirector ejecutivo de Netflix, Ted Sarandos, negó rotundamente esas cifras y calificó los datos de inexactos, señalando que no sabía de dónde procedían.

Se eliminó la obligatoriedad de inscribirse en el Registro de demanda de vivienda de la Generalitat y de presentar una declaración responsable que acreditara el cumplimiento de requisitos para acceder a estas viviendas. Estos mecanismos actuaban como filtro inicial antes del visado final por parte de la Conselleria. La normativa anterior pretendía garantizar transparencia y evitar fraudes en la adjudicación.

La Conselleria de Vivienda defiende el cambio argumentando que separa mejor los demandantes de promoción pública y privada (con perfiles y rentas distintos), y que el nuevo decreto refuerza los controles en la fase de visado, incluyendo autorizaciones para verificar datos tributarios y económicos con otras administraciones.

Durante el juicio celebrado en la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, los dos acusados reconocieron haber insultado y acosado verbalmente a la víctima, aunque negaron haberle golpeado directamente y atribuyeron los puñetazos a un tercer amigo.

Los informes de seguimiento de las pruebas piloto realizadas durante el último año muestran que reducir la jornada laboral a 32 horas semanales y ofrecer flexibilidad horaria mejora significativamente la salud emocional de las trabajadoras y trabajadores. Expertas en sociología y psicología del trabajo destacan que este modelo disminuye el agotamiento crónico (burnout), ya que un tercer día de descanso permite una desconexión real que la jornada tradicional de 40 horas no garantiza. Además, las trabajadoras que experimentan bienestar emocional son un 15% más productivas y tienen un 40% menos de bajas por ansiedad.

Aunque nació como una herramienta para garantizar el acceso a la vivienda a hogares de ingresos bajos y medios, la reducción sostenida de su producción y la flexibilización de los requisitos de acceso han ido desdibujando su función social. En un contexto de crisis residencial y subida generalizada de precios, las VPO son cada vez menos y están dirigidas a rentas más altas.

Desde 1991 se han construido cerca de 1,7 millones de viviendas protegidas en España, pero muchas de ellas han perdido con el tiempo su calificación y han pasado al mercado libre, contribuyendo a la escalada de precios. La producción actual está en mínimos históricos: en 1995 se concedieron más VPO que en todo el periodo comprendido entre 2017 y 2025.

Además del pago de la fianza, el magistrado ha impuesto varias medidas cautelares, entre ellas la prohibición de salir de España, la retirada del pasaporte y la obligación de comparecer semanalmente ante el juzgado.

La detención de Francisco de Borbón se enmarca en una investigación más amplia iniciada en 2024, cuando fue arrestado Óscar Sánchez Gil, inspector jefe de la UDEF, al que se le atribuye haber ocultado en su domicilio cerca de 20 millones de euros. Según la investigación judicial, Sánchez Gil habría utilizado su posición dentro de la Policía Nacional para facilitar información y ofrecer protección a redes de narcotráfico a cambio de comisiones, participando posteriormente en el blanqueo de los beneficios obtenidos.

La adjudicación se firmó el 28 de noviembre de 2025, semanas después de la entrada en vigor, el 25 de septiembre, del decreto ley que prohíbe la importación y exportación de material de defensa israelí. Según la información disponible, los chalecos ofertados por la empresa adjudicataria están fabricados en Israel, lo que plantea dudas relevantes sobre la legalidad de la operación.

El contrato se tramitó mediante un procedimiento abierto simplificado y abreviado. Solo concurrieron dos empresas y la segunda fue descartada pese a ofrecer un mayor descuento, al no cumplir —según el informe de la policía local— los requisitos técnicos relativos a la forma y los materiales de los chalecos.

Los archivos, difundidos a finales de enero de 2026, incluyen correos electrónicos y testimonios sin verificar que mencionan situaciones extremas, lo que ha servido de detonante para reactivar viejas teorías de la conspiración.

Entre los nombres citados en los documentos figuran empresarios y personalidades públicas de distintos países, lo que ha incrementado el interés mediático y la circulación de interpretaciones especulativas. En este contexto, ha resurgido un episodio ocurrido en México en 2009 protagonizado por Gabriela Rico Jiménez, una joven que, durante una crisis nerviosa frente a un hotel de lujo en Monterrey, realizó graves acusaciones contra miembros de las élites políticas y empresariales, llegando a afirmar la existencia de asesinatos rituales y canibalismo.

Los recortes impactarán especialmente en las áreas de deportes y de información internacional, con la eliminación de corresponsalías y enviados especiales en distintos puntos del mundo.

Uno de los casos que ha generado mayor repercusión pública es el de Lizzie Johnson, periodista que se encontraba en Ucrania cubriendo la invasión rusa cuando fue informada de su despido.

Rego argumentó que X se ha convertido en un entorno en el que se producen vulneraciones graves y reiteradas de derechos fundamentales, lo que, a su juicio, justifica la necesidad de una intervención más contundente por parte de los poderes públicos.

Esta zona contenía tumbas de decenas de soldados británicos, australianos y otros aliados caídos en la Primera y Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las fotos muestran movimientos de tierra sistemáticos en la esquina suroeste, con eliminación de lápidas, remoción de capa superior del suelo y creación de un gran montículo de tierra como barrera, visibles desde agosto y más evidentes en diciembre de 2025. El antiguo cuidador del cementerio, Essam Jaradah, confirmó dos operaciones de bulldozado: una externa con olivos y otra interna de casi 1.000 m² en la zona de tumbas australianas, realizada probablemente entre abril y mayo tras la retirada israelí.

Ortiz, que se había fugado a Venezuela tras cometer los crímenes, cumplía una condena de 30 años allí hasta que fue repatriado a Estados Unidos junto a otros presos políticos. La promoción de la entrevista emitida por Telemundo ha generado indignación entre las familias de las víctimas, ya que la cadena se cuestiona si Ortiz es víctima o asesino, lo que ha sido considerado insensible y doloroso por los afectados. En el adelanto, Ortiz afirma haber sido torturado en prisión y se muestra con gafas de sol y gorra estadounidense en un entorno ajardinado.

El suceso ocurrió el lunes por la noche en un tren regional que cubría la ruta entre Kaiserslautern y Saarbrücken, en el suroeste del país, según informó la compañía ferroviaria Deutsche Bahn (DB).

Durante un control rutinario de billetes, el revisor, identificado como Serkan C., detectó que un joven de 26 años no disponía de título de transporte. Al intentar expulsarlo del convoy, el pasajero reaccionó con extrema violencia y golpeó repetidamente al empleado en la cabeza. El ataque se produjo poco después de que el tren saliera de la estación de Landstuhl, en el distrito de Kaiserslautern.

Como consecuencia de la agresión, el revisor quedó gravemente herido y tuvo que ser reanimado en el propio lugar de los hechos antes de ser trasladado de urgencia a un hospital en estado crítico.

La novela, concebida como una carta de amor onírica y surrealista a Barcelona, presenta una ciudad múltiple y superpuesta, construida a partir de capas temporales y voces literarias que abarcan distintas épocas y sensibilidades culturales.

Uclés explica que su acercamiento a Barcelona fue fruto de una estancia prolongada gracias a la beca Montserrat Roig, durante la cual se sumergió en la literatura catalana y en la historia cultural de la ciudad. De ese proceso surge un relato coral, con más de 80 artistas e intelectuales, que busca provocar al lector y transmitir una imagen caótica y rica de Barcelona, similar a un mosaico o un *trencadís*.

Sumar considera que las declaraciones de Irene Montero, en las que plantea ampliar el derecho al voto a los inmigrantes regularizados o incluso cambiar la ley para permitirlo, refuerzan el marco argumental de PP y Vox.

Se describen métodos clásicos para dividir en dos partes (por la diagonal o por el centro) y en cuatro (por las dos diagonales o cortes perpendiculares), destacando que todos generan piezas equivalentes. Para tres partes, un corte paralelo simple falla en igualar el borde, ya que los trozos centrales y laterales difieren en corteza.

UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Steve Bannon, exasesor jefe de Donald Trump durante su primer mandato, ha provocado una fuerte polémica tras asegurar en su pódcast War Room que el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) rodeará los colegios electorales en las próximas elecciones de noviembre en Estados Unidos. Según Bannon, esta medida serviría para impedir un supuesto fraude electoral, una acusación que volvió a reiterar sin aportar pruebas, insistiendo en que no permitirán que el país sea “robado” de nuevo.

Las declaraciones han generado una ola de críticas y preocupación en redes sociales y entre expertos en derechos civiles, que consideran que la presencia de agentes federales en los puntos de votación constituye una forma clara de intimidación del electorado. El Brennan Center for Justice recuerda que tanto la legislación federal como la de los estados prohíben expresamente el despliegue de fuerzas federales en colegios electorales y cualquier práctica destinada a amedrentar a los votantes.

Según el informe policial remitido a la Audiencia Nacional, Sánchez habría facilitado la entrada de 58,5 toneladas de cocaína ocultas en 37 contenedores marítimos procedentes de Latinoamérica, con un valor estimado superior a los 2.060 millones de euros. A cambio, habría recibido al menos 32 millones de euros.

La investigación se apoya de forma decisiva en el volcado del teléfono móvil de Ignacio Torán, considerado el cabecilla de la organización criminal, donde se hallaron anotaciones detalladas, pantallazos y mensajes que evidencian una relación prolongada con el inspector jefe, conocido entre los narcos como “El Amigo”. Sánchez proporcionaba información sensible sobre controles aduaneros y sistemas de inspección, alertando a la red criminal de qué contenedores iban a ser revisados y cuáles no.

Según el Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear, entre el 3,8% y el 7% de las muertes por esta enfermedad se atribuyen a la exposición al radón, con Galicia y Extremadura como las comunidades más afectadas. El gas, que emana de rocas ricas en uranio, puede acumularse en los edificios y su concentración varía considerablemente según la ubicación, la altura de la vivienda, el tipo de construcción y la densidad de población.

A mediodía del 4 de febrero de 2026, el nivel del agua rozaba los 1,90 metros y el caudal superaba los 80 m³/s, cifras muy elevadas aunque aún lejos de las registradas en las graves inundaciones de febrero y marzo de 2025, cuando se superaron los 2 metros y los 400 m³/s.

La Delegación del Gobierno en Madrid, siguiendo el Protocolo de Comunicación de Crecidas, ha pedido extremar la precaución, evitar acercarse a los cauces fluviales y limitar los desplazamientos innecesarios. En San Fernando de Henares se están instalando barreras provisionales para proteger el polideportivo municipal ante un posible desbordamiento. El delegado del Gobierno, Francisco Martín, se ha desplazado al lugar para supervisar los trabajos.

Esta declaración se enmarca en su persistente narrativa de fraude masivo en los comicios de 2020, que aún niega pese a la ausencia de pruebas y a múltiples rechazos judiciales. Trump argumenta que es necesario centralizar el voto para evitar supuestas trampas demócratas, vinculándolo también a su política de deportaciones masivas de inmigrantes indocumentados, a los que acusa sin evidencia de votar ilegalmente en grandes cantidades.

La propuesta choca directamente con la Constitución estadounidense, que en el artículo I, sección 4, asigna a los estados la regulación de las elecciones, manteniendo un sistema descentralizado gestionado por funcionarios locales de ambos partidos.

Estas momias, conservadas gracias al clima árido, pertenecen a una población antigua que los científicos denominan 'fantasma', ya que su linaje genético no había sido identificado previamente de forma directa en restos físicos.

Dirigido por la arqueogenetista Nada Salem, del Instituto Max Planck de Antropología Evolutiva, el análisis muestra que esta rama se separó de los linajes subsaharianos hace unos 50.000 años, coincidiendo con la migración de humanos modernos fuera de África.

La decisión, comunicada a través de un extenso texto en redes sociales, llega después de que el juez haya apreciado indicios de criminalidad y haya decidido enviar al ex portavoz de Sumar al banquillo. Mouliaá subraya que su retirada no implica una retractación ni una negación de los hechos denunciados.

En su comunicado, la actriz insiste en que tanto la Fiscalía como el juez instructor han considerado que existen elementos suficientes para que el proceso judicial continúe. Precisamente por el carácter público del procedimiento, la causa seguirá su curso aunque ella deje de participar activamente como acusación particular. Mouliaá explica que su decisión responde a un límite personal, marcado por el desgaste emocional y por el hecho de haber sostenido la denuncia en solitario.

Según un estudio publicado en 2024 por la Escuela de Salud Pública de la Universidad de Harvard, seis grandes redes sociales ingresan alrededor de 11.000 millones de dólares anuales en Estados Unidos gracias a la publicidad dirigida específicamente a menores de edad. Este modelo de negocio explica, en parte, la resistencia del sector tecnológico a las nuevas restricciones anunciadas por el Gobierno español, como la prohibición del acceso a redes sociales a menores de 16 años.

El informe señala que el uso de redes sociales entre menores se ha duplicado en la última década y que casi la mitad de los menores de edad las utilizan de forma habitual, a pesar de que muchas plataformas prohíben el registro de menores en sus propias condiciones de uso.

La solución fue innovadora: eliminar las alas tradicionales y diseñar el fuselaje de manera que él mismo generara sustentación, dando origen a los llamados Cuerpos Sustentadores (Lifting Bodies). El primer prototipo, el M2-F1, estaba construido de madera y tubos de acero y fue remolcado por un Pontiac descapotable para sus primeras pruebas. Este diseño evolucionó hacia modelos metálicos como el M2-F2 y el HL-10, lanzados desde bombarderos B-52, que permitían aterrizajes planeados pero extremadamente difíciles. El accidente del piloto Bruce Peterson en 1967 dio lugar a la famosa introducción de la serie 'El Hombre de los Seis Millones de Dólares'. Con el X-24B, la NASA logró aterrizajes precisos y sentó las bases para el Transbordador Espacial.

Desde su incorporación al gobierno local en junio de 2023 con Unidad X Alguazas, ha logrado recuperar 107 viviendas, reduciendo notablemente la okupación y la delincuencia en un municipio de unos 10.000 habitantes. La estrategia implementada incluye evaluaciones individualizadas de cada caso, coordinación con la Policía Local y desokupaciones “in fraganti”, procedimientos legales que permiten desalojos inmediatos cuando la ocupación acaba de producirse. En situaciones más complejas, como narcopisos o casos que involucran a personas vulnerables, intervienen los Servicios Sociales para garantizar apoyo y recursos adecuados.

Durante el reportaje, se recogen posturas diversas. Algunos ciudadanos relativizan el caso y sostienen que, de no tratarse de una persona vinculada a una figura política relevante, no tendría tanta exposición mediática. Otros, sin embargo, subrayan que el propio González Amador ha reconocido los hechos y la deuda con Hacienda, por lo que consideran que no existe una persecución política, sino la aplicación normal de la ley.

Ortega Smith sostiene que la votación de su expulsión se realizó en apenas dos minutos a través de un grupo de WhatsApp, lo que a su juicio demuestra que el CEN ha dejado de ser un órgano deliberativo para convertirse en una instancia meramente formal que ratifica decisiones tomadas de antemano por la cúpula del partido.

Esta situación coloca a España como uno de los cuatro países europeos donde los ingresos por pensión pública son suficientes para cubrir los costes básicos de la jubilación, junto con Polonia, República Checa y Rumanía. No obstante, esta suficiencia promedio no elimina las vulnerabilidades. Los colectivos más expuestos al riesgo de pobreza son las mujeres jubiladas, quienes no poseen vivienda en propiedad y los hogares con ingresos más bajos. La vivienda representa el 38% del gasto de los mayores, y aunque el 80% de los jubilados son propietarios, los que viven de alquiler enfrentan mayor presión económica.

El estudio revela un “eje regulador” celular que involucra al receptor PPARβ/δ, fundamental para que la metformina ejerza parte de sus efectos en la reducción de glucosa en sangre. Además, este mecanismo aumenta los niveles de la proteína GDF15, asociada con una mejor utilización de la energía y la regulación del metabolismo. Este hallazgo no cambia los tratamientos actuales, pero aporta información crucial para el desarrollo de terapias más personalizadas y eficaces, especialmente para pacientes que responden de manera variable a la metformina.

Además, el artículo destaca la actitud reciente de Tarantino: crítico de otros cineastas, provocador en redes y semirretirado, mientras sus colegas siguen innovando y defendiendo el cine en salas.

Se destaca que Benjamin Netanyahu, primer ministro de Israel, se opuso a hacer concesiones y que las ofertas presentadas por Clinton y Ehud Barak eran insuficientes y sesgadas a favor de Israel, según reconocimientos de negociadores israelíes y estadounidenses.

Saif al Islam fue una de las figuras más relevantes del régimen de su padre y durante años fue considerado su posible sucesor.

La decisión responde a la aplicación del principio de prejudicialidad penal, al coincidir los hechos investigados por Hacienda con los que forman parte de una causa penal en curso por presuntos delitos de corrupción en los negocios.

Carrasco, esposa de Fernando Camino, presidente de Quirón Prevención, está imputada en una pieza separada vinculada a la investigación sobre la pareja de la presidenta madrileña, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. El juez considera que la continuidad del procedimiento administrativo podría interferir con la instrucción penal, ya que las personas y operaciones examinadas por la Agencia Tributaria son sustancialmente las mismas que se investigan en sede judicial.

La actuación se inició gracias a la colaboración ciudadana, que alertó del posible abandono de varios animales encerrados en una vivienda aislada y sin ninguna persona a su cargo. A partir de ese aviso, agentes del Servicio de Protección de la Naturaleza (SEPRONA), junto con veterinarios de la Junta de Castilla y León, realizaron varias inspecciones para comprobar el estado de los canes.

En el interior de la vivienda, apuntalada para evitar su derrumbe, los agentes hallaron a los once perros rodeados de excrementos, sin alimento y en un ambiente de grave insalubridad. Los animales presentaban un estado físico muy deteriorado, con signos evidentes de desnutrición. Según las investigaciones, llevaban al menos un mes abandonados y solo habían logrado sobrevivir gracias a la ayuda puntual de un vecino, que les]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rescatados-once-perros-podenco-en-grave-estado-de-abandono-en-una-vivienda-de-la-bureba</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rescatados-once-perros-podenco-en-grave-estado-de-abandono-en-una-vivienda-de-la-bureba</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 11:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Documentos del caso Epstein mencionan a varias figuras españolas sin imputaciones penales]]></title><description><![CDATA[La publicación de millones de documentos del caso Jeffrey Epstein por parte del Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos, en aplicación de una ley de transparencia, ha sacado a la luz numerosos nombres de personas que mantuvieron algún tipo de contacto directo o indirecto con el financiero estadounidense.

La presencia de estos nombres en los archivos no implica la comisión de delitos ni su inclusión formal en la investigación judicial, extremo que el propio artículo subraya.

Uno de los nombres más destacados es el del rey emérito Juan Carlos I, mencionado en más de una decena de documentos, en su mayoría recortes de prensa y correos internos de Epstein.

Sin embargo, desde el Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación (MAPA) insisten en que la normativa es clara: cualquier alimento que entre en la UE debe cumplir exactamente los mismos requisitos que los producidos dentro del mercado comunitario, exista o no un acuerdo comercial.

Ambas penas provienen del sumario 13/13, un caso controvertido por las intervenciones del CNI y las denuncias de torturas durante el proceso.

El auto, fechado el 28 de enero y difundido por Efe, concede diez días naturales desde la notificación para que ingresen voluntariamente en prisión; de no hacerlo, se emitirán órdenes de busca y captura.

Estas viviendas, levantadas sobre suelo público vendido por el Ayuntamiento a una cooperativa por 6,6 millones de euros, estaban destinadas a garantizar el acceso a la vivienda habitual y a evitar cualquier uso especulativo.

La normativa autonómica establece que los adjudicatarios de viviendas protegidas en régimen de compra deben empadronarse en ellas y destinarlas a residencia habitual, además de cumplir estrictos requisitos económicos. Sin embargo, según ha denunciado Compromís, algunos propietarios no residen en los inmuebles, otros viven en el extranjero y varios pisos han sido anunciados en portales inmobiliarios a precios muy superiores a los permitidos, lo que constituiría una clara irregularidad.

A través de la exageración visual y el simbolismo, el autor invita al lector a cuestionar por qué muchos de los llamados “archivos Epstein” siguen sin esclarecerse completamente y por qué determinados ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-vineta-critica-sobre-el-caso-epstein-y-las-elites-de-poder-en-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-vineta-critica-sobre-el-caso-epstein-y-las-elites-de-poder-en-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 07:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El debate sobre el boicot a festivales vinculados a KKR pone a prueba el compromiso del público y los artistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La venta de abonos para grandes festivales de música en España vuelve a situar en primer plano el debate sobre el boicot cultural a empresas vinculadas con la ocupación israelí de territorios palestinos. Superstruct Entertainment, propietaria de eventos como Arenal Sound, Viña Rock, FIB Benicàssim, O Son do Camiño o Resurrection Fest, pertenece al fondo de inversión estadounidense KKR, señalado por organizaciones como Who Profits por beneficiarse indirectamente de la ocupación a través de su participación en Axel Springer.

A diferencia del año pasado, cuando muchos asistentes alegaron desconocer esta relación, en 2026 el público compra las entradas con la información ya disponible. La cuestión central es si el conocimiento de estos vínculos se traducirá en un boicot real o quedará en un gesto simbólico.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el gobierno laborista galés, responde a un creciente malestar social ante la desconfianza hacia la clase política, alimentada por promesas incumplidas y la manipulación informativa.

La nueva norma busca proteger a los votantes y reforzar la calidad democrática, situando la verdad y los hechos verificables en el centro del debate público. En un contexto marcado por la proliferación de noticias falsas y estrategias de desinformación, la ley envía un mensaje claro: el discurso político no está exento de responsabilidad legal.

Epstein, delincuente sexual convicto, fue hallado sin vida en agosto de 2019 en su celda del Centro Correccional Metropolitano de Nueva York, mientras esperaba juicio por múltiples cargos de tráfico sexual. El informe forense determinó que la causa de la muerte fue el suicidio por ahorcamiento, con la presencia de varias fracturas en huesos del cuello, incluido el hioides.

Según los médicos forenses, este tipo de fracturas puede darse tanto en casos de ahorcamiento como en estrangulamientos, aunque son más frecuentes en homicidios. No obstante, los especialistas subrayan que la rotura del hioides no es incompatible con un suicidio, especialmente en personas de edad avanzada como Epstein, que tenía 66 años. El informe también describe la presencia de hemorragias petequiales en los ojos y en las mucosas de los labios, un hallazgo habitual en m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-autopsia-de-jeffrey-epstein-detalla-fracturas-cervicales-compatibles-con-ahorcamiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-autopsia-de-jeffrey-epstein-detalla-fracturas-cervicales-compatibles-con-ahorcamiento</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Catorce jóvenes detenidos en Ontinyent por delitos de odio y agresiones tránsfobas continuadas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha detenido en la localidad valenciana de Ontinyent a 14 jóvenes de entre 15 y 20 años como presuntos responsables de una serie de delitos de odio, lesiones, amenazas y quebrantamiento de condena contra una persona de su entorno que había realizado un cambio de sexo. Según la investigación, los hechos se prolongaron desde junio de 2024 y se produjeron de forma reiterada en distintos ámbitos de la vida cotidiana de la víctima, incluyendo el centro educativo, espacios de ocio y celebraciones públicas.

Los investigadores han constatado que las agresiones eran tanto físicas como verbales y que se llevaban a cabo de manera grupal, con el objetivo de intensificar la intimidación y la humillación hacia la víctima. Las actuaciones incluían insultos, vejaciones, amenazas y ataques directos motivados por transfobia, lo que llevó a tipificar los hechos como delitos de odio.

Los hechos incluyen zarandear, golpear, vejar y encerrar a los menores en habitaciones sin supervisión. Las pruebas clave son varios vídeos grabados por trabajadoras del centro, quienes decidieron permanecer en sus puestos durante más tiempo para documentar las agresiones en lugar de abandonar el empleo como habían hecho otros empleados anteriormente. En una de las grabaciones se ve cómo la mujer obliga a una niña a tragar un trozo de manzana sujetándola del cuello con fuerza. En otra, coge la mano de un niño y la utiliza para golpear a otro menor.

Estos documentos muestran una correspondencia y relación continuada entre Chomsky y Epstein incluso después de la condena de este último en 2008 por delitos sexuales relacionados con menores. Prashad, quien sufrió abusos sexuales en su infancia, afirma que no puede tolerar ningún tipo de vínculo con alguien que explotó a niños, y considera indefendible la amistad de Chomsky con Epstein. Destaca que en febrero de 2019, meses antes de los nuevos cargos federales contra Epstein, Chomsky le aconsejó ignorar la cobertura mediática negativa y la 'histeria' sobre el abuso de mujeres. Prashad lamenta que, pese a ser su mentor, Chomsky nunca mencionara estas reuniones o contactos en sus conversaciones personales.

Frente a esa visión equidistante, el autor sostiene que la guerra tuvo ganadores y perdedores muy claros: los republicanos, demócratas y defensores de la legalidad fueron derrotados, mientras que los fascistas no solo ganaron militarmente, sino que se enriquecieron materialmente gracias al conflicto y a la represión posterior.

Maestre apoya su argumento en una cita del propio Francisco Franco, pronunciada en 1940, en la que reconocía que los ricos que participaron en la guerra salieron aún más ricos al finalizarla, gracias a la apropiación y revalorización de bienes que antes estaban en riesgo. Este reconocimiento, según el autor, desmonta el relato de la derrota colectiva y explica por qué determinados sectores insisten en diluir las responsabilidades: aceptar que hubo vencedores implica admitir ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El bitcoin cae un 40% tras su máximo de 2025 en un contexto de menor demanda y cambio de preferencias de inversión]]></title><description><![CDATA[El bitcoin atraviesa una fase de fuerte corrección tras haber marcado un máximo histórico en octubre de 2025. Desde entonces, su cotización ha caído alrededor de un 40%, pasando de más de 105.000 euros a situarse en torno a los 64.000 euros en apenas cuatro meses. A diferencia de caídas anteriores, los analistas subrayan que no existe un detonante único y claro que explique este desplome, lo que ha alimentado la preocupación en el mercado.

Según fuentes citadas por Bloomberg, el problema principal es una crisis de confianza. La demanda de bitcoin estaría disminuyendo, la liquidez sería más limitada y el activo se estaría comportando de forma cada vez más desconectada de los grandes mercados financieros. Tradicionalmente, las criptomonedas se han presentado como un refugio alternativo en periodos de inestabilidad, pero en esta ocasión no han reaccionado ni al estrés geopolítico ni a la debilidad del dólar, ni siquiera a las fuertes oscilaciones recientes del oro y la plata.

Tras la detección inicial de una anomalía en el fondo marino mediante instrumentos de vigilancia, las autoridades activaron un estricto protocolo de confidencialidad para evitar expolios.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en el anuncio realizado por Sánchez en Dubái, donde avanzó su intención de prohibir el acceso a las redes sociales a menores de 16 años como parte de una estrategia de protección frente a los riesgos digitales. La medida, que afecta de lleno a plataformas como X, propiedad de Musk, fue duramente criticada por el magnate.

A través de su propia red social, Musk calificó a Sánchez con términos como “fascista”, “totalitario”, “tirano” o “traidor”, utilizando un lenguaje especialmente agresivo que no pasó desapercibido.

Este volumen de agua ha superado la capacidad de absorción del terreno, provocando un fenómeno poco habitual en la zona: la surgencia de la Sima de la Olla, un manantial natural que expulsa el exceso de agua acumulada en el subsuelo. La Sima de la Olla se encuentra a pocos kilómetros del núcleo urbano de Grazalema y es conocida por su espectacularidad, aunque estas circunstancias la han hecho especialmente llamativa esta semana. Las lluvias intensas también han afectado a la infraestructura local, cortando la carretera que conecta Benamahoma con El Bosque y dejando aislada temporalmente a la población. Ante la situación, la Unidad Militar de Emergencias (UME) ha movilizado 250 militares y 90 vehículos para colaborar en las tareas de seguridad y recuperación.

Los archivos incluyen correos electrónicos que evidencian la interacción social de Chomsky con Epstein, como la planificación de reuniones y vacaciones, así como intercambios financieros vinculados a asuntos personales y profesionales. Entre los correos más destacados, Chomsky aconseja a Epstein sobre cómo manejar la atención mediática, incluso años después de que Epstein se declarara culpable de delitos sexuales con menores. También se documentan intercambios con otras figuras conocidas, como Steve Bannon y posibles referencias al cineasta Woody Allen. Aunque no hay pruebas de que Chomsky estuviera involucrado en los abusos cometidos por Epstein, los documentos contradicen declaraciones anteriores del académico que minimizaban su vínculo, sugiriendo que su relación no era exclusivamente financiera.

Epstein respondió positivamente a la anécdota, y ambos comentaron sobre las características de mujeres jóvenes. La denunciante, que menciona contactos con Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Ferguson y Leon Black, también describe haber visto indicios de actividades inapropiadas en la casa de Epstein y haberse marchado perturbada.

Durante su trabajo en Minneapolis, acompañó a activistas contrarios a esta agencia en labores de vigilancia ciudadana y fue testigo directo de una detención que tuvo consecuencias inmediatas para una menor de once años, cuya madre fue arrestada mientras ella quedaba sola y desprotegida.

Pastor relató cómo, tras la detención, la niña tuvo que refugiarse en casa de una vecina en plena nevada, portando una carpeta con documentos para explicar que su madre había sido arrestada.

Según el Boletín Hidrológico del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica, los embalses peninsulares se sitúan en el 67,3% de su capacidad, lo que supone un incremento de 8,1 puntos en apenas siete días. Esta cifra está más de 14 puntos por encima de la media de la última década y supera ampliamente los registros habituales para esta época del año.

Hasta 31 pantanos han alcanzado el 100% de su capacidad, lo que ha obligado a realizar desembalses controlados en varias cuencas para garantizar la seguridad de las infraestructuras. El mes de enero ha sido clave en esta recuperación: ha resultado el más lluvioso de los últimos 25 años en la España peninsular, con un 85% más de precipitaciones de lo normal según la Aemet.

El evento, que pretendía debatir sobre la Guerra Civil Española con un enfoque de reconciliación y equidistancia, generó polémica desde el principio por su título (inicialmente más provocador en borrador) y por la participación de figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros. Varios participantes de izquierdas, como el escritor David Uclés, Antonio Maíllo (IU) y otros, renunciaron al considerar el planteamiento sesgado o inadecuado. Pérez-Reverte y la fundación atribuyeron la suspensión al 'sectarismo' y 'cobardía' de la izquierda (moderada y radical), incluyendo críticas en redes de Podemos, y anunciaron el aplazamiento a octubre manteniendo el título.

Pena, residente en Estados Unidos desde 2009, se había posicionado públicamente a favor de las políticas migratorias más restrictivas del presidente Donald Trump, defendiendo redadas, deportaciones rápidas y la criminalización de migrantes. En sus contenidos, diferenciaba entre 'criminales' —a quienes según él iba dirigida la represión— y el resto, pidiendo calma a la comunidad brasileña ante las primeras oleadas de detenciones del nuevo mandato.

La detención se produjo por no presentarse a una vista judicial relacionada con su propio estatus migratorio, según confirmaron fuentes cercanas al Brazilian Times y The Guardian.

La reseña fue escrita por Paige Rolland, una adolescente que utilizó la plataforma literaria Wattpad para dar su opinión, sin emplear insultos ni lenguaje ofensivo. Pese a ello, Brittain se obsesionó con el comentario y decidió tomar represalias.

Tras investigar la vida de la joven a través de redes sociales, el autor viajó cerca de 600 kilómetros desde Bedford, en Inglaterra, hasta Glenrothes, en Escocia, donde Rolland trabajaba en un supermercado. Una vez allí, la atacó por la espalda con una botella de vino mientras ella se encontraba desempeñando su labor.

Los modelos meteorológicos prevén acumulados semanales de entre 100 y 150 mm en amplias zonas, con picos que pueden alcanzar los 300 mm en regiones como Galicia, Extremadura y Andalucía.

Una de estas alternativas es Zrce, en la isla croata de Pag, que se está consolidando como el nuevo epicentro europeo de la fiesta. La playa ofrece festivales internacionales y clubes abiertos las 24 horas, como Papaya, Aquarius, Noa, Kalypso y Euphoria, con DJ de renombre. La gran ventaja de Zrce frente a Ibiza es el coste: vuelos directos desde Reino Unido desde 21 libras, entradas a discotecas gratuitas antes de medianoche o por menos de 10 euros, y bebidas mucho más asequibles.

El caso reciente de una concejala del PP que recorrió 50 km solo para gritar un insulto al presidente del Gobierno evidencia que este tipo de conductas se están naturalizando como si fueran parte de la libertad de expresión o del debate político. Sin embargo, la realidad es que se trata de violencia verbal que degrada la democracia y deshumaniza a los adversarios políticos. El silencio o la tibieza frente a estas acciones contribuyen a que el odio se infiltre en la vida política y social, afectando la convivencia democrática. Además, el programa vincula este fenómeno con otros asuntos de actualidad, como las revelaciones de los 3,5 millones de documentos del caso Epstein y su impacto en figuras políticas y empresariales, y con la regularización masiva de migrantes en España, donde los datos contradicen la idea de un 'efecto llamada' negativo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-del-insulto-y-el-discurso-de-odio-en-la-politica-espanola</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-normalizacion-del-insulto-y-el-discurso-de-odio-en-la-politica-espanola</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Últimas reflexiones del periodista Carlos Hernández antes de su fallecimiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[El periodista y escritor Carlos Hernández, fallecido a los 56 años, dejó escrita una emotiva carta que se publicó póstumamente en elDiario.es.

El testimonio de las familias afectadas revela un patrón de actuación basado en el envío reiterado de cartas de reclamación, en algunos casos cada quince días, acompañadas de advertencias sobre posibles embargos.

Las declaraciones llegan poco después de un allanamiento del FBI en una oficina electoral del condado de Fulton (Georgia), un foco habitual de las teorías de Trump. Según la noticia, el propio presidente habría influido indirectamente en la operación a través de la directora de Inteligencia Nacional, Tulsi Gabbard. Trump ha reiterado que existen 'estados muy corruptos' y ha sugerido que los registros incautados revelarán 'resultados interesantes'.

Eso es lo que ha ocurrido durante años con los correos electrónicos vinculados a Jeffrey Epstein, difundidos en internet a través de archivos PDF escaneados, documentos de texto e imágenes procedentes de procesos judiciales y divulgaciones oficiales. La dispersión y el formato poco amigable de estos materiales han dificultado su consulta sistemática por parte de periodistas, investigadores y ciudadanos.

Un nuevo proyecto web llamado Jmail propone una solución centrada en la usabilidad. En lugar de presentar los correos como archivos sueltos, la plataforma recrea una interfaz similar a Gmail, organizada en bandejas de entrada y salida, hilos de conversación y un buscador interno.

Según el estudio HBSC-2022, que analiza los comportamientos sexuales de jóvenes escolarizados de entre 15 y 18 años, el 34,8 % ha mantenido relaciones sexuales coitales, una cifra similar entre chicos y chicas. Sin embargo, el uso del preservativo ha descendido de forma significativa en las dos últimas décadas: desde 2002 ha caído 18 puntos, situándose en el 65,5 % en 2022.

El descenso es especialmente acusado entre las adolescentes de 15 y 16 años, donde en solo cuatro años el uso del condón se ha reducido casi 16 puntos. Esta tendencia ha ampliado la brecha de género: mientras el 70,6 % de los chicos utilizó preservativo en su última relación sexual, solo lo hizo el 60,8 % de las chicas.

Las autoridades ucranianas informaron de al menos diez personas heridas, daños en edificios residenciales, una guardería y una gasolinera en Kiev, así como afectaciones a las centrales térmicas operadas por la empresa DTEK, siendo este el noveno ataque importante a sus instalaciones desde octubre.

La polémica se enmarca en un contexto de crecientes divisiones dentro del GOP, especialmente en torno a la lealtad personal a Trump y a la gestión de asuntos sensibles como la publicación de documentos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein.

Tras el incidente, el menor de 4 años fue ingresado de forma preventiva en el Hospital Universitario de Navarra para valoración. La madre del niño, de 30 años y con la patria potestad suspendida desde diciembre de 2024 por declaración de desamparo, recibió el primer aviso del centro el 18 de enero mediante un mensaje de WhatsApp en el que se indicaba que el pequeño estaba bien y había sido hospitalizado por 'verbalizaciones' que requerían evaluación profesional, activándose un protocolo de protección, sin mencionar en ningún momento la posible naturaleza sexual del hecho.

La pieza audiovisual se presenta como una excursión por lo que Abascal define como “el corazón del Pirineo”, con un tono divulgativo y cercano al medio natural.

Durante el recorrido, grabado en un entorno invernal con abundante nieve, Abascal y sus acompañantes avanzan por la montaña mientras comentan aspectos relacionados con la flora y la fauna de la zona. En varios momentos intentan identificar especies de árboles y aves, con dudas entre álamos, abedules, hayas o arces, y mencionan el uso de aplicaciones móviles para ayudar en la identificación.

El comando Txikia excavó un túnel bajo la vía por la que pasaba diariamente el almirante tras asistir a misa y colocó 75 kilos de explosivos que hicieron volar el vehículo Dodge Dart, matando a Carrero, su chófer y su escolta. ETA reivindicó inmediatamente la acción como venganza por ejecuciones de militantes vascos y en pro de la liberación nacional vasca, negando cualquier colaboración externa.

El texto destaca el impacto del magnicidio: desestabilizó el franquismo tardío, facilitó indirectamente la Transición democrática al eliminar a una figura clave del continuismo ultraconservador y evidenció que el régimen no estaba 'atado y bien atado'.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el Ayuntamiento, busca acercar las fiestas y símbolos culturales locales a las nuevas generaciones a través del juego, la convivencia y el respeto, integrando tradición y ocio en un entorno accesible.

Durante el acto inaugural, la alcaldesa de Onda, Carmina Ballester, destacó que este parque pretende mantener viva una parte esencial de la identidad del municipio, fomentando al mismo tiempo valores como la socialización y el uso compartido del espacio público. El parque cuenta con diversos elementos de juego adaptados a edades infantiles, entre los que se incluyen un cadafal con tobogán, una pequeña plaza de toros, barreras, figuras de toro y vaca, así como juegos de muelle anclados al suelo.

El primero garantiza la revalorización de las pensiones y recoge otras medidas vinculadas a la Seguridad Social, como las cuotas de los autónomos o el Ingreso Mínimo Vital. El segundo agrupa el resto del denominado escudo social, que incluye el bono energético, ayudas por la dana, bonificaciones fiscales y la prórroga de la moratoria antidesahucios.

La decisión de dividir el paquete en dos textos responde a las presiones políticas cruzadas dentro del bloque parlamentario que sostiene al Ejecutivo. Tanto el PP como Junts exigían que la subida de las pensiones se aprobara por separado, mientras que las fuerzas de izquierda defendían mantener intacto el conjunto de medidas sociales. El punto más conflictivo ha sido la moratoria de los desahucios, que Junts y el PNV consideran perjudicial para los pequeños propietarios.

La denuncia acusaba al exlíder socialista de delitos de narcotráfico, blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, supuestamente derivados de su relación política y personal con el expresidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro.

El magistrado instructor, Antonio Piña, adoptó esta decisión tras analizar un informe contundente de la Fiscalía Antidroga, que calificó la querella como un conjunto de “conjeturas, suposiciones y deducciones infundadas”. Tanto el juez como el ministerio público subrayan que en todo el escrito de Hazte Oír no aparece ni un solo indicio concreto, dato verificable o prueba que permita sostener las graves acusaciones formuladas contra Zapatero.

Durante su intervención en el World Governments Summit celebrado en Dubái, Sánchez aseguró que España prohibirá el acceso a las redes sociales a los menores de 16 años, obligando a las plataformas a implantar sistemas efectivos de verificación de edad. Esta medida se enmarca en el proyecto de ley de protección de los menores en los entornos digitales, actualmente en tramitación parlamentaria, y sigue la estela de iniciativas similares adoptadas en otros países europeos como Francia o Portugal.

El cambio principal consiste en eximir a los propietarios de una sola vivienda en alquiler —o de dos propiedades cuando una sea la residencia habitual— de la obligación de ofrecer una alternativa habitacional a los inquilinos vulnerables en caso de impago.

Según explica el PNV, esta modificación responde a una reivindicación sostenida por el grupo parlamentario vasco, que considera que la normativa anterior equiparaba injustamente a pequeños arrendadores con grandes tenedores o fondos de inversión. A juicio de la formación, esa equiparación trasladaba una carga económica excesiva a personas que dependen del alquiler de un único piso como complemento de renta o ahorro, obligándolas a asumir largos periodos de impago sin capacidad real de respuesta.

Varios interesados relatan que, al intentar comprar pisos de la urbanización Les Naus, se les exigieron cantidades muy superiores al precio máximo legal, con una parte importante del pago en dinero negro para esquivar la normativa autonómica.

Una de las afectadas explica que contactó con una inmobiliaria tras ver un anuncio en un portal especializado y que le solicitaron 227.000 euros declarados y otros 223.000 en efectivo, una cifra que considera desorbitada. Según su testimonio, desde la propia agencia se normalizó esta práctica con frases como “esto es España”. Otros compradores potenciales confirman experiencias similares, con peticiones de contratos privados y entregas de grandes sumas en metálico antes de la firma oficial.

Draghi destacó que en los ámbitos donde la UE ya actúa de forma federalizada —como el comercio, la competencia, el mercado único y la política monetaria— es tratada como una potencia global y logra negociar en igualdad de condiciones, citando acuerdos comerciales exitosos con India, América Latina o el Mercosur.

Además de la multa económica, el regulador ha prohibido a determinadas sociedades del grupo presentarse a licitaciones públicas para el suministro de gasóleo A durante un periodo de seis meses.

Según la CNMC, Repsol, que ostentaba una posición de dominio en el mercado mayorista nacional de combustibles para automoción, incurrió en una práctica de estrechamiento de márgenes.

Según los expertos en seguridad y el proveedor de hosting, el ataque no se originó por vulnerabilidades en el código de Notepad++, sino por un fallo en el servidor que permitió el acceso a credenciales internas. El actor detrás del ataque fue probablemente un grupo patrocinado por el Estado chino, focalizándose específicamente en Notepad++. Tras la detección, el proveedor migró todos los clientes a un nuevo servidor y aplicó mejoras de seguridad, incluyendo la rotación de credenciales y la corrección de vulnerabilidades. Notepad++ reforzó su sistema de actualizaciones WinGup en la versión 8.8.9, verificando certificados y firmas de los instaladores, y planea aplicar una verificación más estricta en la próxima versión 8.9.2.

Según el autor, esta lectura geopolítica es en gran medida ilusoria y oculta las verdaderas motivaciones económicas del acuerdo. Las negociaciones, iniciadas en 2007 y retomadas en 2022, responden sobre todo al intento europeo de reproducir el modelo que durante dos décadas vinculó a la UE con China: acceso a un gran mercado en expansión, exportaciones de productos de alta gama y aprovechamiento de mano de obra barata.

Desde esta perspectiva, la India aparece como un sustituto de China tras el agotamiento del llamado “momento chino”, que benefició especialmente al capitalismo alemán pero dejó importantes costes sociales e industriales en otros países europeos.

Según los últimos datos anunciados por el Carter Center, en 2025 solo se han registrado 10 casos humanos en todo el mundo, la cifra más baja desde que comenzó el programa internacional de erradicación en 1986. De confirmarse estos datos, esta parasitosis podría convertirse en la segunda enfermedad humana erradicada de la historia, tras la viruela.

El gusano de Guinea es un nematodo que se transmite a través del consumo de agua contaminada con pequeños crustáceos que portan sus larvas. Tras infectar a la persona, el parásito migra por el cuerpo y, aproximadamente un año después, emerge lentamente por la piel a través de una ampolla extremadamente dolorosa, normalmente en piernas o pies. El proceso puede prolongarse durante semanas y conlleva un alto riesgo de infecciones secundarias, sepsis y discapacidad temporal o permanente.

La operación, desarrollada este lunes, se ha saldado con al menos seis personas detenidas y varias más investigadas. Entre los arrestados figuran varios trabajadores de la propia estación de ITV y, de forma especialmente relevante, un agente de la Guardia Civil, aunque por el momento no se ha detallado públicamente el grado de implicación de este último en los hechos.

Según la investigación, el entramado certificaba de manera fraudulenta reparaciones que en realidad no se habían llevado a cabo, permitiendo que vehículos en mal estado y con graves carencias técnicas superaran la inspección obligatoria. Esta práctica suponía un riesgo directo para la seguridad vial, al permitir la circulación de coches que no cumplían las condiciones mínimas exigidas para circular por las carreteras.

La actriz y presentadora acudió al programa televisivo ‘¡De viernes!’ para aclarar cómo fue su trato con Epstein y contextualizar una relación que, según sus palabras, se limitó al ámbito personal y de amistad.

Obregón explicó que conoció a Epstein a comienzos de los años ochenta en Nueva York a través de un amigo común, cuando ella residía en la ciudad por motivos de estudios y trabajo. En aquel momento, Epstein era presentado como un empresario atractivo y bien relacionado. La actriz relató que durante ese periodo llegó a alojarse en su casa durante dos semanas, insistiendo en que no mantuvieron una relación sentimental ni sexual.

Se trata de una iniciativa poco habitual en aerolíneas occidentales, pero más alineada con las estrategias de otras grandes compañías del Golfo, como Qatar Airways o las aerolíneas saudíes, que utilizan este tipo de infraestructuras como herramienta clave para atraer y retener talento en un mercado laboral altamente competitivo.

El complejo estará ubicado en el Dubai Investments Park, una zona estratégica próxima tanto al actual aeropuerto internacional de Dubái, donde opera Emirates, como al futuro Al Maktoum International Airport, al que la aerolínea prevé trasladar sus operaciones en los próximos años.

Tradicionalmente centrado en el televisor del salón, el tiempo libre se organizaba alrededor de rutinas familiares y espacios compartidos. Hoy, el ocio se ha desplazado al ámbito digital y personal, principalmente a través de móviles y pantallas individuales. Aunque los españoles siguen disfrutando de entre cuatro y media y seis horas diarias de ocio, su consumo se ha fragmentado en microintervalos llenos de estímulos constantes, desde redes sociales y videojuegos hasta plataformas de streaming como Netflix. Este cambio no solo afecta al entretenimiento pasivo, sino también a la socialización, la identidad y la pertenencia, especialmente entre jóvenes y menores, que dedican gran parte de su tiempo libre a TikTok, YouTube y juegos online.

El precio de la vivienda de segunda mano ha aumentado un 20,4% interanual en enero, el mayor incremento registrado en las dos últimas décadas. Este encarecimiento sitúa el precio medio de venta en 2.897 euros por metro cuadrado, lo que supone que un piso tipo de 80 metros cuadrados alcance un coste aproximado de 231.700 euros, muy cerca de los máximos históricos previos al estallido de la burbuja inmobiliaria de 2007.

La vivienda nueva tampoco ofrece alivio, ya que cerró 2025 con un aumento cercano al 9%, consolidando una tendencia generalizada de subidas en todo el mercado residencial.

Su padre, Antonio Ascari, falleció en 1925 a los 37 años en un accidente durante el Gran Premio de Francia en Montlhéry, cuando Alberto tenía solo siete años. Ciccio, como se le conocía por su complexión robusta, heredó el talento de su progenitor y debutó en el motociclismo en 1936, logrando victorias con marcas como Gilera y Bianchi. En 1940 condujo el primer Ferrari en la Mille Miglia, aunque un fallo mecánico lo retiró pronto.

Tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Ascari brilló en competiciones como el GP de Módena (1947) y se unió a Ferrari, donde ganó los títulos mundiales de Fórmula 1 en 1952 y 1953 con una superioridad aplastante, incluyendo un récord de 75 % de victorias en una temporada que aún se mantiene.

Gorbachov, convencido del ideal comunista y preocupado por la decadencia económica, militar y tecnológica de la URSS, impulsó profundas reformas mediante la Perestroika y la Glasnost. Aunque bienintencionadas, estas políticas precipitaron la desintegración del sistema soviético, la pérdida de sus satélites en Europa del Este y la fragmentación del país en quince repúblicas independientes, con graves consecuencias económicas y sociales que todavía se sienten.

Mucho antes de la llegada de exploradores europeos con cámaras e instrumentos, comunidades como los inuit, los sámi o los chukchi habían desarrollado sociedades complejas adaptadas a un entorno extremo, basadas en la caza, la pesca, la movilidad estacional y un conocimiento profundo del hielo, el clima y los animales.

Uno de los ejes centrales del texto es la figura de William Bradford, pintor y fotógrafo estadounidense que publicó en 1873 la obra “The Arctic Regions”, un volumen monumental financiado en parte por la reina Victoria y editado en una tirada muy limitada.

La foto, etiquetada a lápiz con la inscripción “El difunto Carrington” y con un estilo consistente con el momento histórico, parecía coincidir con la edad y vestimenta de Carrington.

El estudio revela que la pérdida de autonomía es menor de lo esperado, y depende principalmente del año de fabricación. Los modelos más antiguos, como el Nissan Leaf de 2012, conservan alrededor del 81% de su autonomía original, mientras que los coches de segunda generación (2017-2021) mantienen entre el 85% y el 88%. Los vehículos más modernos alcanzan incluso el 91% de su autonomía tras recorrer 241.000 km, gracias a mejoras en la química de las baterías, sistemas de gestión térmica y estrategias de eficiencia.

Originalmente pensado como un adorno alegre para celebrar el Año del Caballo, el error en la costura de la boca convirtió al 'caballo llorón' en un símbolo inesperado de los trabajadores sobrecargados y poco valorados. Muchos jóvenes empleados en China, que soportan largas jornadas bajo la cultura laboral '996' (de 9 a.m. a 9 p.m., seis días a la semana), se identifican con la expresión del peluche, utilizándolo en memes y publicaciones para expresar su agotamiento y frustración. La tienda de Yiwu que lo fabrica ha visto cómo los pedidos se disparaban, obligando a ampliar la producción, y el juguete ha comenzado a venderse también en otras regiones de Asia, África y Oriente Medio. Más allá de su aspecto tierno y melancólico, el caballo llorón refleja la presión social y laboral ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-peluche-de-caballo-llorando-se-convierte-en-simbolo-de-trabajadores-sobrecargados-en-china</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-peluche-de-caballo-llorando-se-convierte-en-simbolo-de-trabajadores-sobrecargados-en-china</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Empleados de ICE denuncian retrasos en pagos y falta de seguro médico tras promesas incumplidas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un número creciente de empleados de la agencia estadounidense de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) ha comenzado a expresar públicamente su frustración por retrasos en el pago de salarios y la falta de activación de seguros médicos, incluso semanas después de haber sido contratados. La agencia, que recientemente incorporó a 12.000 nuevos agentes, enfrenta problemas administrativos que han llevado a que personal de primera línea recurra a Reddit para relatar sus dificultades. Entre las quejas, destacan la imposibilidad de cubrir gastos médicos para hijos enfermos y la ausencia de los bonos prometidos. Los sueldos, que según el nivel y la experiencia podrían variar entre 51.600 y 84.000 dólares anuales para oficiales de deportación de nivel inicial, incluyen incentivos adicionales, como horas extras, seguros y bonos de firma, muchos de los cuales no se han materializado.

La distribución de los $100.810 millones se reparte entre 1.062 cuarteles, unos $95 millones por asociación, un monto insuficiente considerando que un solo traje forestal cuesta más de $5.000.

Según explicó, conoció a Epstein a través de un amigo común que insistió en presentarle al que entonces era considerado un atractivo y exitoso soltero. Obregón relató que llegaron a mantener una relación de amistad cercana y que, en un momento complicado para ella, llegó a vivir dos semanas en su casa tras incendiarse su apartamento.

Según la información facilitada por los servicios de emergencia y recogida por Europa Press, los hechos ocurrieron en torno a las 10.00 horas en una vivienda situada en la calle Constitución.

La víctima fue atacada por dos personas desconocidas que la rociaron con un líquido abrasivo y la golpearon de forma reiterada, causándole fracturas en la mandíbula y en las extremidades superiores, así como quemaduras de segundo y tercer grado en aproximadamente el 40% de su cuerpo.

La receptora, Carme, sufrió una grave necrosis facial provocada por una infección bacteriana que destruyó gran parte de los tejidos de su rostro y le impidió realizar funciones básicas como comer, hablar o respirar con normalidad. Tras años de aislamiento y deterioro físico y emocional, el trasplante supuso para ella una oportunidad real de recuperar calidad de vida.

La intervención, de carácter parcial, ha sido especialmente compleja y ha contado con la participación de cerca de un centenar de profesionales de distintas especialidades médicas.

Aunque la Consejería de Salud había negado deficiencias, los testimonios de varias pacientes de hospitales como el HUCA en Oviedo, Cabueñes en Gijón y Valle del Nalón en Langreo evidencian lo contrario, incluyendo casos de consultas retrasadas meses que derivaron en cirugías posteriores.

A pesar de haber actuado correctamente y llamar al personal para que limpiara el derrame, la empresa la acusó de haber sustraído bienes sin autorización y la despidió por 'causa justificada'.

El caso ha generado polémica y los sindicatos, como la CGIL, han calificado la situación como absurda y desproporcionada, destacando que la trabajadora actuó con total corrección. Se ha iniciado un proceso legal para impugnar el despido, y se espera que la sentencia se dicte a mediados de marzo.

Ventura, que quedó segundo en la primera vuelta con cerca de un cuarto de los votos, ha conseguido en seis años que Chega pase de tener un único diputado a ser la principal fuerza de oposición, gracias a su discurso contra la inmigración, ciertos colectivos minoritarios y la corrupción gubernamental. Esta movilización del centro-derecha busca subrayar su compromiso con los valores democráticos y trazar una línea roja frente a las fuerzas radicales, aunque paradójicamente podría reforzar la narrativa anti-establishment de Ventura.

Ese día entraron en la cafetería Woolworth’s de Greensboro y se sentaron en una barra reservada exclusivamente a personas blancas, desafiando de forma directa las leyes y normas sociales que sostenían la segregación racial en el sur del país.

La reacción fue inmediata: el personal se negó a atenderlos y algunos clientes los increparon, pero los jóvenes permanecieron sentados de manera pacífica hasta el cierre del local, anunciando que volverían al día siguiente.

A los problemas estructurales propios de la actividad se suma una combinación de factores que, según los profesionales, hacen inviable mantener las explotaciones. Entre ellos destaca la lucha constante contra la varroa, un parásito que provoca una elevada mortandad en las colmenas y obliga a dedicar gran parte del esfuerzo a la repoblación en lugar de a la producción de miel o polen.

A esta dificultad sanitaria se añade el impacto del cambio climático, que ha reducido de forma drástica la producción y ha elevado las pérdidas por encima del 40%.

El cierre fue comunicado a la clientela el pasado viernes por Montse Clos, que llevaba más de dos décadas al frente del establecimiento. Durante este tiempo, el horno no solo ha sido un comercio de proximidad, sino también un actor activo en la vida social y cultural del barrio, participando habitualmente en iniciativas como el concurso de escaparates de Sant Medir.

Negueruela señala también a la presidenta del Govern, Marga Prohens, por “blanquear” a Airbnb durante su presencia en FITUR, mientras los ciudadanos enfrentan aumentos de alquileres superiores al 100%, lo que obliga a muchos a alquilar habitaciones en lugar de pisos completos.

El hombre, de 92 años, padecía un cáncer de estómago en fase terminal y tenía reconocido un grado 3 de dependencia. Los profesionales de cuidados paliativos recomendaron a la familia contar con una persona de apoyo para asistirle en tareas básicas como la higiene, la alimentación o la medicación, ya que su esposa era la única cuidadora permanente.

La solicitud de la ayuda se presentó a finales de noviembre ante los servicios sociales de Leganés. Según relata el nieto, el proceso estuvo marcado por dificultades administrativas y por un trato que califica de despectivo por parte de responsables municipales, en un contexto de extrema urgencia debido al estado de salud del paciente.

Según los escritos judiciales, el liderazgo eclesiástico, incluidos familiares directos del acusado, fomentó una cultura de silencio y protección institucional que facilitó los abusos a al menos 11 menores.

Zachary Radcliff, de 30 años, fue apartado de su cargo en octubre de 2024 tras salir a la luz denuncias por abusos contra 10 niños y una niña. Posteriormente, fue enviado a juicio con 60 cargos, entre ellos 17 por conducta sexual criminal en primer grado, delitos que podrían acarrearle cadena perpetua.

La FINUL explicó que las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel informaron previamente de que llevarían a cabo una operación aérea con el lanzamiento de una sustancia que describieron como “química no tóxica”. No obstante, la advertencia incluyó la recomendación expresa de que las tropas de la ONU se alejaran de la zona afectada, lo que impidió el desarrollo normal de las tareas de supervisión y apoyo a las Fuerzas Armadas libanesas.

El eje central del programa lo forman los submarinos S-80, desarrollados por Navantia, que incorporan tecnologías avanzadas como la propulsión independiente del aire, sensores de nueva generación y mayores capacidades de sigilo y autonomía.

Existen varias modalidades de tarán: el impacto con la hélice, que busca destruir la cola del enemigo; el tarán de ala, donde se golpea el ala o superficies de control; el uso del tren de aterrizaje para dañar al adversario sin comprometer el fuselaje propio; y la embestida de fuselaje, último recurso extremadamente peligroso. Históricamente, pilotos como Pyotr Nesterov, Alexander Kazakov, Viktor Talalikhin, Yekaterina Zelenko, Amet-Khan Sultan y otros llevaron a cabo estas maniobras en conflictos del siglo XX, desde la Primera Guerra Mundial hasta la Guerra Fría, demostrando audacia y precisión excepcionales.

Con una pensión mensual cercana a los 2.000 euros, Miguel Ángel vivía de forma independiente hasta que la subida sostenida de los precios del alquiler hizo inviable mantener su vivienda en solitario.

Según explica, hace tres años pagaba 660 euros por un piso situado en la periferia de la ciudad, una cantidad que suponía aproximadamente un tercio de sus ingresos y que podía asumir sin grandes dificultades. Sin embargo, en ese periodo el alquiler se incrementó alrededor de un 23%, alcanzando los 830 euros mensuales. Este aumento provocó que el gasto en vivienda pasara a representar casi la mitad de su pensión, una proporción que compromete seriamente su estabilidad económica.

El líder del Partido Popular evitó asumir responsabilidades políticas en relación con sus comunicaciones con el presidente valenciano, Carlos Mazón, y centró gran parte de sus respuestas en criticar al Gobierno central y a la Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar. Esta estrategia provocó el malestar de varios diputados y, de forma destacada, la intervención reiterada de la presidenta de la comisión, Carmen Martínez.

El momento más tenso se produjo durante el intercambio con el diputado de EH Bildu, Oskar Matute. Ante una pregunta directa sobre si había amparado la actuación del presidente autonómico durante la tragedia, Feijóo desvió la respuesta hacia cuestiones ajenas a la DANA, introduciendo referencias a ETA y vinculando a Matute con el entorno de la izquierda abertzale.

La autora explica que no tenía intención inicial de escribir ni de cocinar algo complejo, pero que finalmente decidió aprovechar ingredientes básicos que tenía a mano, combinando ambas cosas.

La receta parte de patatas peladas y cortadas en rodajas, que se dejan a remojo mientras se preparan las verduras.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la mañana del sábado 31 de enero y han generado una fuerte reacción social en una ciudad especialmente sensible a las cuestiones de convivencia y diversidad cultural.

Según el testimonio difundido públicamente en nombre del agente afectado, el guardia civil se encontraba desayunando con su familia cuando varios policías nacionales, sentados en una mesa cercana, comenzaron a proferir insultos en voz alta. Entre las expresiones denunciadas figuran calificativos racistas y deshumanizantes como 'mono' y 'chimpancé', además de una amenaza explícita de agresión física. Los comentarios fueron realizados de forma audible para el resto de clientes y para los hijos del agente, presentes en el local.

Matute respondió reprochando a Feijóo que utilizara a ETA como un 'comodín' y defendió su historial sin antecedentes penales, insinuando que su partido no puede decir lo mismo.

El llamado “Great Healthcare Plan” se reduce a un PDF de apenas dos páginas y carece de medidas concretas capaces de abordar los problemas estructurales de la sanidad estadounidense, un sector que consume cerca del 17% del PIB. Según el autor, el plan se limita a reciclar ideas clásicas del ideario republicano que ya han demostrado ser ineficaces o impopulares.

La propuesta se apoya en tres pilares principales. El primero es la reducción del precio de los medicamentos mediante la figura de la “nación más favorecida”, una fórmula que pretende igualar los precios estadounidenses a los de otros países. El problema es que el Estado federal no compra directamente los fármacos y el sistema está plagado de intermediarios privados, por lo que la medida resulta inaplicable sin una reforma profunda del merc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-el-nuevo-plan-sanitario-de-trump-repite-viejas-recetas-republicanas-y-fracasa-en-reducir-costes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más de un centenar de mujeres andaluzas reclaman indemnización tras fallos en los cribados de cáncer de mama]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 101 mujeres han presentado reclamaciones patrimoniales ante el Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS) tras desarrollar cáncer de mama debido a fallos en los cribados sanitarios de Andalucía. La crisis surgió por errores en la comunicación de los resultados de las mamografías, provocando que estas pacientes no fueran notificadas a tiempo y no pudieran recibir tratamiento preventivo. La asociación Amama cifra en hasta 338 el número de mujeres afectadas, incluyendo una víctima que ha fallecido. El origen del problema está vinculado a la externalización del servicio y la informatización del sistema, que sustituyó el seguimiento manual y la comunicación directa con las pacientes. La gestión pasó a empresas privadas como NTT Data e Indra, mientras que algunos protocolos de seguimiento se desactivaron, provocando que las cartas de aviso no llegaran a su destino.

Uno de los datos más alarmantes es la situación de la infancia: uno de cada tres menores vive en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social, y más de dos millones de niños crecen en entornos sin las condiciones mínimas para su desarrollo. Los participantes coincidieron en que tener un empleo ya no garantiza una vida digna, debido a salarios insuficientes, precariedad laboral y un sistema de ayudas que no se ha adaptado al aumento del coste de la vida.

Según relata, la clave está en unas condiciones laborales reguladas y en una remuneración que permite vivir con dignidad del trabajo. En el país nórdico, un camarero puede percibir alrededor de 3.000 euros netos mensuales, a lo que se suman horas extraordinarias pagadas de forma obligatoria y, en muchos casos, la comida incluida durante la jornada laboral.

Sáez destaca que la jornada semanal estándar en Noruega es de 37,5 horas, inferior a las habituales en España, y que existe un respeto real por los descansos y la conciliación entre vida personal y profesional. Este marco hace que la hostelería sea vista como una profesión sostenible y atractiva, y no como un empleo temporal o de última opción.

Diversos artistas aprovecharon la enorme visibilidad del evento para lanzar mensajes políticos y sociales en defensa de los derechos de las personas migrantes.

Uno de los momentos más destacados de la noche lo protagonizó Bad Bunny, que hizo historia al ganar el Grammy a álbum del año con un disco íntegramente en español. En su discurso, el artista puertorriqueño fue especialmente contundente al pedir el fin del ICE y denunciar la deshumanización de los inmigrantes, recordando que son personas y ciudadanos con derechos. Además, apeló a una forma de lucha basada en el amor y no en el odio, subrayando que responder al odio con más odio solo refuerza la división social.

Daniel comenzó a vapear en sexto de primaria, en pleno auge de los cigarrillos electrónicos, atraído por su fácil acceso, los sabores dulces y la normalización de su consumo en entornos escolares y sociales. Lo que empezó como algo puntual terminó convirtiéndose en una adicción diaria que llegó a alcanzar un vaper al día, equivalente a unas 700 caladas o a fumar alrededor de 35 cigarrillos.

Con el paso del tiempo, Daniel empezó a notar graves problemas respiratorios: dificultad para respirar al hacer ejercicio, episodios nocturnos de asfixia y una sensación constante de falta de aire, incluso en reposo. Tras acudir al médico, fue diagnosticado con un edema pulmonar incipiente, una afección seria provocada por el vapeo que le llevó a temer por su vida y a replantearse su relación con la salud.

La obra incluye un registro exhaustivo de asesinatos, golpes de Estado, masacres respaldadas por Estados Unidos, sanciones y presiones políticas aplicadas para garantizar el control de recursos y mercados extranjeros.

En una entrevista concedida al semanario francés Le Journal du Dimanche, Aznar considera que esta posición transmite una imagen de “sectarismo inútil” y de incomprensión del contexto internacional, especialmente ante los socios de la Alianza Atlántica. Según el exlíder del PP, negarse a cumplir un acuerdo firmado por el resto de países aliados debilita la credibilidad de España y la sitúa en una posición aislada dentro del bloque occidental.

Aznar va más allá del debate presupuestario y califica a Sánchez como un “populista radical”, al que asocia con modelos políticos latinoamericanos como el kirchnerismo.

Este fenómeno implica un aumento abrupto de las temperaturas en la estratosfera, alterando los patrones climáticos habituales en Europa, Norteamérica y Asia. El vórtice polar actúa normalmente como una barrera que mantiene el aire frío en el Ártico, y su colapso puede debilitar el Jet Stream, permitiendo que el aire polar se desplace hacia el sur y el aire cálido ascienda hacia el norte. Existen dos formas de colapso: desplazamiento, que provoca frío localizado, y división, que puede generar olas de frío generalizadas, como ocurrió en 2018 con la conocida “Bestia del Este”. Tras un CES, los efectos en la superficie no son inmediatos, apareciendo entre dos y cuatro semanas después.

A partir del caso del cómico Quequé y la cancelación de la gira del espectáculo 'Hora Treintaypico', el texto expone cómo sectores de extrema derecha utilizan la violencia verbal y las amenazas físicas para intentar silenciar a comunicadores críticos o vinculados a la izquierda.

El autor subraya que ya no se trata de debates sobre el mal gusto, la sensibilidad o la crítica legítima a un chiste o a un discurso, sino de una estrategia deliberada de intimidación. Amenazas como llamamientos al asesinato o a agresiones directas cruzan una línea peligrosa que afecta a la libertad de expresión y a la seguridad personal.

Los hechos ocurrieron en la tarde del 31 de enero en el parque de Josep Serra Martí, una zona frecuentada por vecinos y jóvenes del barrio.

Según la información confirmada por fuentes cercanas a la investigación, los agresores se aproximaron a las víctimas con la intención de sustraerles los patinetes eléctricos que utilizaban. Durante el asalto, emplearon machetes para intimidar y agredir a los menores, provocándoles heridas de consideración.

Sin embargo, la planificación del transporte público, especialmente del Metro, está generando una clara desigualdad entre los nuevos barrios del norte y los del sur y sureste de la capital. Mientras desarrollos como Valdebebas o Madrid Nuevo Norte acumulan entre tres y cinco estaciones proyectadas, otros barrios recientes como El Cañaveral siguen sin una estación propia y dependen de conexiones más lejanas o de autobuses.

Valdebebas, con unos 30.000 habitantes y grandes equipamientos como la Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid o el hospital Zendal, contará con varias paradas y una conexión directa con el aeropuerto. En contraste, El Cañaveral, con una población similar, vio descartada su estación de Metro por problemas geotécnicos del terreno, según la Comunidad de Madrid.

El documento, elaborado como trámite previo obligatorio para autorizar el gasto, señala que el acuerdo tendrá repercusiones no solo en el Servicio Cántabro de Salud, sino en todo el sector público autonómico durante al menos 16 años, con posibilidad de prórroga hasta alcanzar dos décadas.

El informe, firmado por el jefe de Servicio de Gestión Presupuestaria, subraya que el volumen de gasto comprometido obligará a adoptar medidas de priorización del gasto público en futuros ejercicios. En concreto, el convenio prevé un desembolso total de 216 millones de euros, cifra que posteriormente fue incrementada en otros 40 millones una vez aprobado definitivamente el acuerdo.

Esta medida ha generado un fuerte rechazo entre agricultores y pescadores españoles, que denuncian una situación de competencia desleal. Organizaciones como Asaja y FEPEX alertan de que tomates cherry, melones, pescado congelado y pulpo procedentes de la región de Dakhla entran en la UE con menores costes laborales, sociales y ambientales, presionando los precios y reduciendo la rentabilidad de las explotaciones nacionales.

A partir de una anécdota histórica del rey godo Teodorico, que castigó la falta de principios de un ministro incapaz de ser fiel ni a su dios, la autora traza un paralelismo con reinas y consortes contemporáneas que renunciaron a sus creencias por conveniencia política y matrimonial.

Concostrina analiza varios casos: desde Charlene de Mónaco y su conversión al catolicismo, pasando por Mary de Dinamarca y otras consortes que cambiaron de confesión como trámite administrativo, hasta el ejemplo español, donde la religión fue durante décadas un requisito político de primer orden.

Göbekli Tepe, reconocido como Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO desde 2018 y datado hacia el 9600 a.C., es considerado el templo más antiguo conocido.

Aunque en los medios se presentan como casos aislados —por ejemplo, empleados despedidos por comerse un producto destinado a la basura—, el texto sostiene que estas situaciones son solo la excusa final de una estrategia planificada.

Según el artículo, las empresas esperan a que el trabajador cometa una falta menor o fabrican acusaciones de bajo rendimiento para justificar un despido disciplinario inmediato, sin preaviso ni indemnización. Si el trabajador no demanda, la empresa consigue un despido gratuito.

El diputado autonómico Xabel Vegas califica esta postura como 'populismo pesquero' y la considera irresponsable desde el punto de vista ambiental, al ignorar la evidencia científica sobre el grave declive de la anguila europea.

Según recuerda la formación, el Consejo Internacional para la Exploración del Mar (CIEM) lleva años recomendando capturas cero debido al colapso de la especie. En este contexto, Sumar defiende no solo la prohibición total de la pesca de la angula, sino también de su comercialización y consumo.

Según Pappé, el Estado israelí no puede considerarse una democracia, ya que mantiene un sistema de apartheid que niega derechos civiles y humanos a la población palestina desde 1948 y, especialmente, desde la ocupación iniciada en 1967. Para el historiador, la imagen democrática de Israel es una construcción ideológica que no resiste un análisis riguroso.

Pappé describe una profunda fractura interna entre dos proyectos de país: el denominado “Estado de Judea”, representado por la extrema derecha religiosa y nacionalista aliada a Netanyahu, y el “Estado de Israel”, vinculado a sectores laicos y liberales.

Aunque el dólar sigue siendo moneda de reserva, la creciente desconfianza en la sostenibilidad de la deuda estadounidense impulsa a bancos centrales y gobiernos a reforzar sus reservas en metales preciosos. Este fenómeno recuerda la decadencia de antiguas potencias, como Francia y Reino Unido tras el fiasco del Canal de Suez en 1956, y se refleja en la política exterior agresiva de Washington en múltiples frentes, desde Venezuela hasta Cuba. La globalización ha dado lugar a nuevas potencias económicas y tecnológicas, especialmente en Asia, mientras que los intentos de EEUU de mantener su dominio comercial y militar muestran signos de micromilitarismo internacional y de defensiva ante la pérdida de influencia.

La urbanización, levantada en las décadas de 1960 y 1970 sobre dunas y en una zona de alta erosión natural, ignoró la dinámica litoral y eliminó las barreras naturales que permitían a la playa regenerarse tras los temporales. Durante años, la anchura del arenal ocultó el riesgo, pero la pérdida progresiva de arena ha dejado viviendas, paseos marítimos y chiringuitos directamente expuestos al mar.

Las borrascas de 2026 no han creado el problema, sino que han acelerado un proceso anunciado desde hace décadas. El agua ha llegado a patios y calles, evidenciando que las soluciones de emergencia, como regeneraciones artificiales de arena o defensas provisionales, solo compran tiempo sin resolver el fondo del asunto. La erosión ha pasado de ser una amenaza futura a una realidad perman]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/matalascanas-y-el-error-historico-de-construir-una-costa-como-si-el-mar-no-cambiara</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/matalascanas-y-el-error-historico-de-construir-una-costa-como-si-el-mar-no-cambiara</guid><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La plaza de toros de El Bibio y su uso como campo de concentración tras la caída de Gijón en 1937]]></title><description><![CDATA[La plaza de toros de El Bibio, uno de los espacios más emblemáticos de Gijón, fue utilizada como campo de concentración por las fuerzas franquistas tras la ocupación de la ciudad el 21 de octubre de 1937. Entre esa fecha y algún momento de 1939, alrededor de quince mil personas pasaron por este recinto, convertido en un lugar de reclusión masiva, hacinamiento y represión, antes de ser trasladadas a cárceles, campos de trabajos forzados o directamente ejecutadas. Pese a la magnitud de los hechos, esta función represiva del coso fue sistemáticamente borrada de la memoria colectiva mediante su reconstrucción, la exaltación de la épica franquista y la ausencia de cualquier señalización oficial.

El artículo detalla cómo, tras los bombardeos sufridos durante la batalla de Gijón, las ruinas de la plaza reunían las condiciones idóneas para encerrar a miles de prisioneros: un amplio espacio cercado, bien comunicado y alejado del centro urbano, lo que permitía ocultar el espectáculo de la repre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-plaza-de-toros-de-el-bibio-y-su-uso-como-campo-de-concentracion-tras-la-caida-de-gijon-en-1937</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-plaza-de-toros-de-el-bibio-y-su-uso-como-campo-de-concentracion-tras-la-caida-de-gijon-en-1937</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 23:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
