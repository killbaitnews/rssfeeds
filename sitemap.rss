Colorist Olga Shirnina brought life to original black-and-white images, offering a more immediate connection to the fearlessness and daily realities of these young aviators. Led by Major Yevdokiya Bershanskaya and formed under Major Marina Raskova’s initiative, the regiment operated primarily at night, employing a tactic of throttling engines to glide stealthily toward targets. The unit earned the coveted Guards designation in 1943 and carried the honorary title “Taman” for its role in the Novorossiysk–Taman operations. Over the war, the Night Witches flew roughly 23,000 sorties and delivered thousands of tons of bombs and incendiaries, despite using aging Polikarpov U-2 biplanes with limited payloads.

The vehicle exploded by a remote detonation beneath the car chassis, killing the general and triggering an intensive security response. Russian police opened a criminal investigation into murder by explosives, with investigators inspecting security footage, conducting forensics, and interviewing witnesses to reconstruct movements around the vehicle. Authorities consider multiple leads, including potential involvement by foreign intelligence services. Since the 2022 war in Ukraine, selective killings and sabotage against strategic infrastructure and security figures have risen, though the violence previously fluctuated between spikes and relative calm. The attack demonstrates that high-ranking military figures can be targeted far from the front lines, underscoring a symbolic dimension given the general’s role in operational readiness.

The report, released by the World Bank and China's Ministry of Finance, outlines the drivers of China's poverty alleviation achievements and offers insights for other developing countries. Two primary strategies have driven China’s success: broad-based economic transformation, which raised average incomes and created new opportunities, and targeted support for disadvantaged areas and households. The report emphasizes the importance of education, infrastructure, and competition-friendly policies. China's approach, combining sustained economic growth with targeted interventions, has been instrumental in reducing poverty, and it serves as a model for other nations. Going forward, China aims to sustain its poverty alleviation efforts through rural revitalization, focusing on industrial deve]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-poverty-reduction-key-lessons-from-40-years-of-progress</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-poverty-reduction-key-lessons-from-40-years-of-progress</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Florida Surgeon General Calls for Repeal of Vaccine Mandates with Support from Moms for Liberty]]></title><description><![CDATA[At the annual summit of the national advocacy group Moms for Liberty in Kissimmee, Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo urged the organization to support efforts to repeal vaccine mandates for schoolchildren. He emphasized that the cooperation of lawmakers in Tallahassee is crucial for these changes. Ladapo spoke about restoring parental rights in medical decisions, aligning with the group’s mission to allow parents more control over vaccination choices. Moms for Liberty, founded in Brevard County, now has a national presence, and many parents voiced their support for less government intervention in vaccine requirements. However, some public health experts have expressed concerns over the potential risks of rolling back vaccination mandates, particularly with outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough and measles. Despite these concerns, parents at the summit expressed their desire for more flexibility in vaccination schedules and decisions regarding their children's health.

A significant power outage, affecting around 125,000 homes and businesses, caused traffic lights to fail, which created chaos for Waymo's fleet of driverless cars. Numerous videos surfaced showing Waymos halted at intersections, blocking traffic as human drivers navigated around them. The power outage, caused by rolling blackouts from Pacific Gas & Electric, led to widespread gridlock, and emergency vehicles faced challenges due to the confusion on the streets. In response, Waymo stated that it paused operations to ensure rider safety and allow clear access for emergency responders. The company confirmed the resumption of its services the following Sunday. This incident highlights the vulnerabilities of autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions, particularly when facing unpredictable scenarios such as power outages.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-due-to-traffic-chaos-during-power-outage</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/waymo-suspends-service-in-san-francisco-due-to-traffic-chaos-during-power-outage</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Countries Where Christmas Is Prohibited: Historical Prohibitions and Current Restrictions]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article surveys the concept of Christmas bans across history and geography, noting that Christmas is a public holiday in over 150 countries and celebrated by Christians who are a minority in many places. It traces periods when Christmas faced suppression, such as in Soviet bloc countries where religion was seen as disloyal to the party, and even in Scotland during the 17th century. It then highlights the modern instances where Christmas is restricted or prohibited, focusing on a small set of countries. North Korea is described as an officially restrictive religious environment where only the leader’s cult is permitted; December 24 is noted as a local holiday in honor of the leader’s grandmother, and December 27 as a constitution-related holiday. Brunei is described as enforcing Sharia law since 2014, prohibiting public Christmas celebrations, Santa costumes, carols, and Christmas trees in public spaces, though some consumer-related displays are allowed.

The loan will be used to cover Ukraine's massive economic and military collapse, raising a total of 90 billion euros over the next two years. While the EU initially considered using Russian assets to back the loan, this proposal was rejected in favor of joint debt financing. The repayment will be financed through national budgets and EU contributions, with payments beginning in 2027. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic have opted out of the agreement, citing financial concerns. Critics argue that the EU should prioritize domestic spending on healthcare, housing, education, and pensions, rather than continuing to fund the war effort in Ukraine. Opposition has been growing as several EU nations, including France and Italy, already face large fiscal deficits, and additional debt could worsen the economic str]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europeans-face-3-billion-euros-annual-payments-for-ukraine-loan-repayment</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europeans-face-3-billion-euros-annual-payments-for-ukraine-loan-repayment</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Masked Immigration Agents Raise Concerns Over Accountability and Abuse]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since President Donald Trump's return to office in January 2025, his administration has engaged in increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics. A notable shift has been the widespread use of federal agents who operate in masks and without visible identification. These practices undermine transparency and accountability, contributing to a climate of fear within immigrant communities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, often in civilian clothes and unmarked vehicles, have been involved in arrests at sensitive locations like courthouses, schools, and places of worship. The rationale for masking is cited as a means to prevent doxing, yet this blanket policy seems to compromise the agents' accountability and transparency, which are crucial for upholding the rule of law. Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases where individuals were apprehended by unidentifiable agents, creating confusion and anxiety. In one instance, a Tufts University student was detaine]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/masked-immigration-agents-raise-concerns-over-accountability-and-abuse</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/masked-immigration-agents-raise-concerns-over-accountability-and-abuse</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe's Pursuit of Digital Sovereignty: Efforts to Reduce Dependence on US Tech Giants]]></title><description><![CDATA[Europe is grappling with its digital sovereignty, driven by a 90% reliance on US cloud services, according to experts like Cristina Caffarra. The US CLOUD Act of 2018 has created a direct conflict with Europe's stringent privacy laws, particularly the GDPR, as American companies are legally compelled to hand over data to US authorities, even if it’s stored in Europe. This situation forces European organizations to seek alternatives to US cloud providers to maintain control over their data and systems. A few public bodies in Austria, Germany, and France, as well as the International Criminal Court, are taking steps to regain digital autonomy by migrating to European solutions like Nextcloud and OpenDesk. The Austrian government, for example, has successfully moved 1,200 employees to Nextcloud, prioritizing control over cost savings. However, the shift is not without challenges. While European alternatives like Nextcloud offer genuine sovereignty, European nations must contend with the r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-s-pursuit-of-digital-sovereignty-efforts-to-reduce-dependence-on-us-tech-giants</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-s-pursuit-of-digital-sovereignty-efforts-to-reduce-dependence-on-us-tech-giants</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Judicial Inaction Enables Expansion of Book Bans Across States, Sparking Free-Read Rights Concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[This piece argues that the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear Leila Green Little et al. v. Llano County effectively allows state and local authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to decide which materials are accessible in libraries, potentially eroding First Amendment protections. Citing PEN America’s tallies of thousands of book-ban incidents, the article contends that the trend reflects a coordinated effort by national conservative groups to remove or suppress books addressing race, gender, and sexuality, disproportionately affecting Black and LGBTQ authors. It portrays librarians as frontline defenders who have faced job losses for not removing materials, framing the issue as a broader civil-liberties battle rather than a local anomaly. The narrative weaves in the documentary The Librarians by Kim A. Snyder to illustrate how censorship campaigns operate at the local level as a testing ground for nationwide strategies, and urges civic engagement—voting, speaking out, or r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/judicial-inaction-enables-expansion-of-book-bans-across-states-sparking-free-read-rights-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/judicial-inaction-enables-expansion-of-book-bans-across-states-sparking-free-read-rights-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Belgium considers measures against climate misinformation and new observatory, sparking debate over information control]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that on November 12, the Belgian government signed a joint declaration in Belem, Brazil, alongside other nations, committing to the integrity of information and the fight against climate misinformation. It notes that roughly fifteen countries have joined this effort. Beginning next year, Belgian radio and television outlets would undergo content reviews focused on weather reporting to identify misinformation, whether intentional or not. The piece presents this as the first step in a broader campaign to steer readers toward information approved by a new climate misinformation observatory, with possible future penalties or sanctions. The piece quotes minister Jean Luc Crucke discussing the aim to understand and counter the phenomenon without replacing existing regulators, and hints at potential future enforcement. The article references historical associations with censorship (nihil obstat) and likens the approach to medieval inquisitions, suggesting a crackdown on cl]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgium-considers-measures-against-climate-misinformation-and-new-observatory-sparking-debate-over-information-control</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgium-considers-measures-against-climate-misinformation-and-new-observatory-sparking-debate-over-information-control</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 04:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Living Under Gang Rule in a Rio Favela: A Complex Preference for Safety Over Democracy]]></title><description><![CDATA[In an article for Haaretz, Yishai Raz shares his unusual perspective on life in a luxury favela in Rio de Janeiro, where a gang holds dictatorial control. While this might seem unsettling to many, Raz finds a sense of safety and order under the gang's rule. He explains that the strict enforcement of the gang's power, including harsh punishments for anyone who steps out of line, creates a secure environment where crime is minimal. Although he acknowledges the authoritarian nature of the gang's governance, Raz contrasts it with his experiences in Israel, where he feels democracy has failed to deliver the security and stability he desires. The article explores themes of governance, security, and the perceived failure of democratic systems in the face of societal instability. Raz's narrative challenges conventional ideas about governance and safety, raising questions about what people prioritize in their communities—freedom or security—and the role of democracy in achieving both.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/living-under-gang-rule-in-a-rio-favela-a-complex-preference-for-safety-over-democracy</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/living-under-gang-rule-in-a-rio-favela-a-complex-preference-for-safety-over-democracy</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 18:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Historical Overview of US Efforts for Regime Change in Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article provides an in-depth analysis of the United States' extensive efforts to destabilize Venezuela and promote regime change over the past three decades. It examines the political, economic, and strategic motives behind U.S. actions, driven primarily by the desire to control Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Beginning with the early 20th century, the piece details the role of U.S. corporations, such as Standard Oil, in Venezuela's oil sector. The Venezuelan nationalization of its oil industry in the 1970s marked a turning point, but the U.S. continued to exert influence. The rise of Hugo Chávez in the late 1990s and his policies of resource sovereignty sparked heightened U.S. opposition, including covert support for a 2002 coup attempt. Over the years, U.S. strategy shifted between low-intensity warfare, economic sanctions, and covert operations aimed at weakening the Chávez and Maduro governments. The Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations all intensified economic pressure thro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-historical-overview-of-us-efforts-for-regime-change-in-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-historical-overview-of-us-efforts-for-regime-change-in-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Belgium Leads EU Rebellion Against Seizing Russian Assets]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article by Thomas Fazi analyzes the growing conflict within the European Union over Brussels’s plan to confiscate Russia’s frozen assets held in Europe. Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever has become a central figure in opposing this proposal, arguing that confiscating the assets would violate international law, undermine financial stability, and set a dangerous precedent. Most of these Russian reserves are held by Euroclear, a major Brussels-based financial institution. Legal experts, including Robert Volterra, have warned that such a move would be illegal and could trigger lawsuits that might bankrupt Euroclear and destabilize Belgium’s economy. 

De Wever’s stance sparked strong backlash from EU officials and pro-EU media, accusing him of siding with Moscow. Yet, other countries — including Hungary, Slovakia, Italy, Bulgaria, and Malta — have joined Belgium’s opposition, fearing that confiscation could erode trust in the euro and cause capital flight. In response, the Europea]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgium-leads-eu-rebellion-against-seizing-russian-assets</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgium-leads-eu-rebellion-against-seizing-russian-assets</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel's 'Zombie Economy': A Look at the Economic Crisis Amid the Gaza War]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since October 2023, Israel's economy has been severely impacted by the ongoing Gaza conflict, with a range of economic shocks that have affected both productivity and public services. Thousands have been displaced from border regions, while hundreds of thousands of reservists were pulled from the workforce, disrupting key sectors. Despite these struggles, some aspects of the economy, like the stock market and the shekel, have shown resilience, though they mask deeper issues. Economist Shir Hever describes Israel's economy as a 'zombie economy,' functioning but with no clear future due to heavy reliance on military expenditure, foreign loans, and denial of the situation. The nation faces significant debt, weakening international trade relations, and boycotts. More than 46,000 businesses have gone bankrupt, and nearly a quarter of Israelis are living in poverty, with rising food insecurity. Despite these hardships, military spending continues to prop up the economy, creating a façade of ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-zombie-economy-a-look-at-the-economic-crisis-amid-the-gaza-war</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-zombie-economy-a-look-at-the-economic-crisis-amid-the-gaza-war</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Titan's Potential Internal Ocean Remains Uncertain]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recent findings have cast doubt on the hypothesis that Titan, Saturn's largest moon, possesses a global liquid ocean beneath its icy surface. While the idea of an ocean rich in ammonia and other compounds has been supported by Cassini's data, a new study challenges this notion by analyzing Titan's response to tidal forces. The original hypothesis suggested a liquid ocean nearly 250 km thick, but new research indicates that instead of a global ocean, Titan might have multiple layers of different types of ice, with potential liquid water pockets. Titan's unique environment, including its methane lakes and thick atmosphere, makes it a fascinating target for NASA's Dragonfly mission, launching in 2028. This mission will explore Titan's dunes and study a region known as the Selk crater, which may have once hosted liquid water and complex organic molecules, important for astrobiological research. The revised theory also suggests that Titan's current state could be the result of a relatively ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titan-s-potential-internal-ocean-remains-uncertain</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titan-s-potential-internal-ocean-remains-uncertain</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 07:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forest City: A $30 Billion Real Estate Failure in Malaysia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Forest City, an ambitious real estate project in Malaysia, was designed to house 750,000 residents and attract foreign investment, particularly from China. Launched in 2006, the development faced numerous challenges, including political changes, stricter regulations on foreign property ownership, and the COVID-19 pandemic. As of early 2025, the population of the city is a fraction of the expected number, with only around 10,000 people living in the area. Despite over $30 billion invested, the island city remains almost deserted, with many buildings and shops empty. Forest City is owned largely by China's Country Garden, which struggled with massive debt, and a local Malaysian investment fund. While the city is being maintained to look pristine, it has faced ecological and diplomatic concerns due to its location in the Strait of Malacca, a critical maritime passage. The Malaysian government has offered tax exemptions to attract more residents, and the city is being marketed as a destina]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forest-city-a-30-billion-real-estate-failure-in-malaysia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forest-city-a-30-billion-real-estate-failure-in-malaysia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Morocco Expands Its Military Modernization Through Israeli Arms Purchases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Morocco continues to expand its military capabilities by purchasing strategic armaments from Israel, signaling a deepening defense relationship between Rabat and Tel Aviv. The article notes that Israel’s defense industry has broadened its client base from Southeast Asia to North Africa, with Morocco validating a new order for heavy artillery within the year. It mentions deployments of Israeli-made equipment in other regional conflicts, illustrating that international criticism of the Gaza war has not disrupted Israeli arms exports. Leading defense companies such as Elbit Systems and Rafael are highlighted as key players in this growth. Morocco reportedly made a significant investment, signing an agreement estimated at 150 to 200 million euros for ATMOS artillery systems, supplementing existing acquisitions like the PULS rocket launcher and the Barak MX air defense shield.

In a recent blog post, the author reflects on the critical themes of the documentary and shares a poignant excerpt that highlights the dangers of the privatization of healthcare. The excerpt features a doctor who passionately discusses how the current trend of privatizing healthcare is leading to preventable deaths. As public healthcare systems collapse under the pressure of underfunding, more and more individuals are unable to access essential care. The doctor warns that this isn't an accidental outcome, but a deliberate policy shift that prioritizes private profits over human lives. Long waitlists, overcrowded primary care, and understaffed emergency services are just some of the deadly consequences of this shift. The post emphasizes that those who promote the dismantling of public healthcare systems are not just poor managers—they are complicit in a system that is ki]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impact of Satellite Megaconstellations on Space-Based Observatories]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent years, the deployment of massive satellite constellations such as Starlink has raised concerns about their impact on astronomical observations, including those conducted from space. Initially, some suggested that moving telescopes to low Earth orbit (LEO) could solve the issue. However, a recent study published in Nature by Alejandro Borlaff, Pamela Marcum, and Steve Howell confirms that even space-based telescopes in LEO are increasingly affected. Currently, about 9,400 Starlink satellites orbit Earth, but projections suggest that by 2040 there could be up to 500,000 satellites, causing significant contamination of astronomical images. Already, 4.3% of Hubble Space Telescope images between 2018 and 2021 were affected. Newer satellites, such as Starlink v2 Mini, are larger and brighter, exacerbating the problem. Future wide-field and all-sky survey missions like NASA's SPHEREx, the Chinese Xuntian telescope, and the European ARRAKIHS could see up to 96% of their observations ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canada’s Controversial ‘Victims of Communism’ Monument Will Remove All Names]]></title><description><![CDATA[A year after its opening, Canada's Monument to the Victims of Communism in Ottawa is facing a major controversy over the names initially set to be inscribed on the memorial. A government report revealed that more than half of the 553 names planned for inclusion were linked to Nazi or fascist affiliations. As a result, the Department of Canadian Heritage has decided to remove all individual names and instead focus on thematic content that aligns with Canadian values of democracy and human rights. The monument, designed by architect Paul Raff, originally sought to commemorate the suffering of millions under communist regimes.

Earlier, EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Kersti Kaljulaid, had pushed for a more aggressive approach to confiscate Russian assets, but concerns over legal, financial, and ethical implications led to a reversal. One consideration, reported by the Berliner Zeitung, is that while the assets are formally state-owned, they may contain funds belonging to private individuals, some of whom could be Jewish. This raises complex questions about targeting sanctions without violating property rights or international law, drawing historical parallels to the seizure of Jewish assets during the Nazi era. The discussion highlights the EU’s balancing act between supporting Ukraine financially and avoiding actions that could be considered discriminatory or unlawful.

Staff recounted that the guest was rarely seen outside the room, and several workers did not know what he looked like due to his limited movements. Upon checkout, staff discovered an enormous mess: a three-foot-deep mountain of toilet paper, food wrappers, bottles, and takeaway containers cluttered every surface. The bathroom was severely littered, with tissues and discarded items covering the sink, and a thick brown grime covering the floor. A table and two gaming chairs were buried under waste. Cleaning required three days of back-breaking work to disinfect and restore the room.

The decision comes amid a broader defense spending spree, as the German Bundestag recently authorized over 50 billion euros for various military projects, including combat vehicles, artillery systems, and space-based assets. The MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, manufactured by General Atomics, will be used for long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions, supporting the German Navy's existing fleet of P-8A Poseidon aircraft. This acquisition effectively ends Germany’s involvement in the EuroDrone program, a European initiative led by Airbus for developing a medium-altitude long-endurance drone.

Baud, who has written extensively on the Ukraine conflict, has been banned from entering EU territory and had his assets frozen despite having no financial ties to Russia. Sonneborn compares the EU's actions to a dictatorship, noting the lack of transparency, the inability for the accused to defend themselves, and the absence of legal processes. He also points out that similar repressive actions are being taken against others who dissent from the mainstream EU narrative on Ukraine and Gaza.

It begins with King Leopold II’s personal acquisition of the Congo in the late 19th century and the international outrage provoked by widespread abuses, including forced labor, corporal punishment, and mass mutilations. Facing growing criticism, Belgian authorities sought to rehabilitate the country’s image through large-scale exhibitions that portrayed colonization as a benevolent and civilizing mission.

A central focus is the monumental artwork “Panorama of the Congo,” commissioned for the 1913 Ghent World’s Fair. Created by Alfred Bastien and Paul Mathieu, the massive circular painting presented an idealized vision of colonial life, emphasizing economic progress, missionary work, and harmony between Europeans and Congolese people. The explicit goal, as stated by organizers, was to make the public forget the scandals as quickly as possible.

According to Salvini, the 19 sanctions packages implemented over nearly four years were intended to weaken Russia but instead have significantly harmed Western economies. He argued that these measures have contributed to economic decline across Europe and have notably driven up energy costs in Italy, placing additional pressure on households and businesses.

Salvini also warned against what he sees as the growing militarization of Europe, which he attributes to an exaggerated or 'phantom' threat posed by Russia.

Most people would assume radiology staff in hospitals or workers at nuclear power plants, both of whom are subject to strict legal exposure limits averaging 20 mSv per year. These limits are already several times higher than the natural background radiation received by the general population, which varies across Spain due to cosmic radiation and local geology.

However, the article highlights a surprising case: bank employees working in a specific branch in the A Coruña area who were exposed to extremely high concentrations of radon gas.

Their research demonstrated that quantum effects, previously observed only at the scale of individual particles, can manifest in systems containing billions of particles. The team designed an experiment using superconducting materials separated by an ultrathin insulating layer, known as a Josephson junction. By cooling the circuit to near absolute zero and performing highly precise measurements, they observed a collective quantum behavior in the circuit, where the system tunneled through an energy barrier without the classical energy required. Additionally, they confirmed that the system could only absorb or emit energy in discrete amounts, verifying the principle of energy quantization.

The event appeared aimed at boosting employee morale but also served as a subtle anti-union campaign ahead of a critical work council election. During the performance, Savas attempted to hype the crowd by arriving on stage in a Cybertruck, changing lyrics in his songs to reference Tesla, and leading chants for Elon Musk. Employees reportedly remained unresponsive, creating an awkward atmosphere. Tesla management, including factory manager André Thierig, took the opportunity to criticize the IG Metall union while announcing a 4% wage increase. However, the union argues that salaries should rise by an additional 30% to match industry standards. IG Metall's chief, Otto, highlighted Tesla's long-standing strategy of encouraging employees to avoid unionizing in exchange for advancement opportunities, framing expansion plans as contingent on election results.

This practice, rooted in the 'julkisuusperiaate' or 'principle of publicity', ensures transparency by allowing the public to access tax records. This year, the dataset included individuals earning over €150,000, roughly 1% of the population. At the top of the list was Mikko 'Miki' Kuusi, founder of Wolt and CEO of Deliveroo, with an income of €80.6 million, paying €39.7 million in taxes. Public access to such data enables informed discussion on income distribution and taxation. Observations reveal persistent trends, such as the underrepresentation of women among the highest earners, with only two women in the top 20. However, Tax Day data has limitations, as it does not include wealth from inheritance, gifts, property, or shares, and some dividend income may be tax-exempt.

Onlookers shouted warnings about her pregnancy, pleading with agents to release her, but one agent allegedly pressed his knees on her body while others used pepper spray against the crowd, including reporters. Protesters responded by throwing snowballs, and ICE called local police for backup. The Minneapolis Police Department later reported that no violence occurred against the officers. ICE successfully arrested the intended targets, a young Ecuadorian couple, while two U.S. citizens were also taken into custody for assaulting federal officers.

The defendants include a regional parliament deputy from Bashkortostan, Dmitry Chuvilin, physician Alexey Dmitriev, retiree Yuri Efimov, and two veterans, Pavel Matisov and Rinat Burkeev. Prosecutors described the group as an organization preparing to overthrow the Russian government and accused them of distributing materials that urged violent seizure of power. The defendants disputed the charges, maintaining their innocence. All five have been in pretrial detention for over three and a half years. The verdict is not final and may be appealed. The case’s chronology suggests the group was detained in March 2022 after meetings at Ufa’s Stalin Museum, where they studied Marxist works and trained physically.

Trump, shortly after the incident, posted on Truth Social referring to Rob Reiner as suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome,' which Greene called 'classless' and inappropriate for a former president. Greene emphasized that the tragedy should be met with compassion rather than politicization, highlighting the family’s grief and the son’s reported struggles with drug addiction and mental health issues.

Described as a decision long anticipated as economically essential, the move underscores systemic weaknesses affecting Volkswagen, the German economy, and the global automotive industry. The company faces a projected requirement to fund approximately €160 billion over five years for electrification, software platforms, and new vehicle architectures. Historically, Volkswagen chose reductions in output or partial reconversions rather than outright plant closures, making Dresden’s shutdown symbolically significant as a showcase facility intended to demonstrate openness, innovation, and brand image.

KJ Muldoon, an infant born with a rare and often fatal metabolic disorder, has begun taking his first steps after receiving a one-patient, customized gene therapy developed by physicians at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). A year earlier, doctors were uncertain whether KJ would survive infancy due to the severity of his condition.

KJ became the first person in the world to receive this type of individualized CRISPR-based treatment, designed specifically to correct the genetic defect responsible for his disorder. Before the therapy, his life was defined by prolonged hospital stays and constant medical monitoring. After receiving treatment earlier in the year, his health stabilized enough for doctors to discharge him in June, allowing him to return home with his family.

Years of poorly planned dam projects, overpumping of aquifers, and neglect of ancient qanat systems have drastically depleted both surface and underground water reserves. The qanats, centuries-old tunnels that sustainably tapped underground water, have largely fallen into disuse due to overpumping from modern wells, causing aquifer depletion and land subsidence. Iran's reservoirs are mostly empty, while rivers and wetlands have dried up, exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Afghanistan. Agriculture accounts for 90 percent of water usage, yet increasing numbers of wells produce less water than before. Hydrologists warn of impending food shortages, repeated water protests, and potential conflicts over water resources. Proposed solutions include restoring qanats, recharging aquifers, redirecting floodwaters, and shifting to less water-intensive crops, though government focus remains]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desmantelado un grupo criminal que saqueaba yacimientos arqueológicos en León y Valladolid]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha recuperado en León una valiosa corona visigoda de oro del siglo VI, junto a miles de piezas arqueológicas robadas, que habían sido saqueadas de importantes yacimientos de Castilla y León.

El Tribunal del Distrito Zamoskvoretsky de Moscú ha emitido una orden de detención contra Kaspárov, acusándole de ser un agente extranjero y de hacer apología del terrorismo debido a sus comentarios contra el gobierno ruso. La orden, que entra en vigor el 26 de diciembre, podría llevar a la detención del ajedrecista en caso de que regrese a Rusia. Sin embargo, dado que Kaspárov reside en Nueva York, es poco probable que sea arrestado dentro del territorio ruso. El propio Kaspárov respondió a la noticia en Twitter, ironizando sobre cómo, según el Kremlin, oponerse al terrorismo estatal ahora se considera terrorismo. Esta situación refleja las crecientes tensiones entre el gobierno ruso y la oposición, especialmente aquellos en el exilio que continúan denunciando las políticas de Putin.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-ordena-la-detencion-de-garri-kasparov-por-criticas-a-putin-y-acusaciones-de-apologia-del-terrorismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-ordena-la-detencion-de-garri-kasparov-por-criticas-a-putin-y-acusaciones-de-apologia-del-terrorismo</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guy Forget reflexiona sobre la ruptura entre Alcaraz y Ferrero y compara sus trayectorias con Nadal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Guy Forget, extenista y antiguo capitán del equipo francés de tenis, ha hablado sobre el estado actual del tenis mundial en una entrevista reciente. En cuanto a la ruptura entre Carlos Alcaraz y su entrenador Juan Carlos Ferrero, Forget se mostró sorprendido, ya que consideraba que la colaboración entre ambos había sido muy exitosa. Señaló que, a sus 22 años, un cambio tan profundo puede afectar la estabilidad de un joven campeón. En su opinión, el modelo de Nadal, quien mantuvo un equipo estable durante más de una década, fue clave para su éxito a largo plazo. Forget también analizó el futuro de Novak Djokovic, destacando que, debido a su edad, el serbio debe gestionar mejor su preparación y recuperación, aunque sigue teniendo la ambición de seguir luchando por títulos. Por último, Forget habló sobre el tenis masculino francés, destacando a Arthur Fils como una de las promesas del tenis, pero advirtiendo que su carrera dependerá de la continuidad y su salud física.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guy-forget-reflexiona-sobre-la-ruptura-entre-alcaraz-y-ferrero-y-compara-sus-trayectorias-con-nadal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guy-forget-reflexiona-sobre-la-ruptura-entre-alcaraz-y-ferrero-y-compara-sus-trayectorias-con-nadal</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenidos dos polacos tras una paliza mortal a dos alemanes en Elche]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado lunes, dos hombres de nacionalidad polaca golpearon hasta la muerte a dos alemanes en la urbanización El Pinet, situada en Elche (Alicante). Los agresores, tras intentar ocultar los cadáveres, se atrincheraron en un chalet durante más de 19 horas. La Guardia Civil, que acordonó la zona y desplegó un operativo para detener a los presuntos homicidas, logró su arresto este martes. La principal hipótesis apunta a que los polacos estaban ocupando de manera ilegal la vivienda y agredieron a los alemanes cuando estos intentaron desalojarlos. Los cuerpos fueron encontrados en plena calle tras un aviso de una vecina, que vio cómo los agresores trataban de sacar los cadáveres de la casa. A pesar de que la teoría del ajuste de cuentas no está descartada, los investigadores apuntan a un conflicto relacionado con la okupación del chalet. Además, una tercera persona se encuentra grave en el hospital tras la pelea.

Esta medida forma parte de un paquete de acciones adoptadas por el Gobierno con el fin de reducir la distancia de las pensiones más bajas respecto al umbral de la pobreza. La ministra de la Seguridad Social, Elma Saiz, detalló estas medidas tras la aprobación de un macrodecreto que también incluye la prórroga de las cuotas de los autónomos y la ampliación de ayudas sociales, como el bono energético y la protección contra los desahucios a familias vulnerables. Estas subidas de las pensiones buscan mejorar la calidad de vida de los colectivos más desfavorecidos, y se enmarcan dentro de la reforma de pensiones que comenzó en 2023 y culminará en 2027. Además, el Gobierno ha mantenido congeladas las cuotas de los autónomos para el inicio de 2026, mientras se busca un acuerdo sobre las reformas a medio plazo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-de-las-pensiones-minimas-y-no-contributivas-en-2026-entre-el-7-y-el-11-4</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-de-las-pensiones-minimas-y-no-contributivas-en-2026-entre-el-7-y-el-11-4</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El CEO de La Mafia se sienta a la mesa alerta sobre el aumento del absentismo laboral en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[Javier, cofundador y CEO de Grupo LMssLM (La Mafia se sienta a la mesa), ha manifestado en el pódcast Itnig su preocupación por el cambio de mentalidad laboral en España tras la pandemia. Aunque su empresa ha duplicado su tamaño en los últimos cuatro años y asegura ofrecer buenas condiciones a sus empleados, Javier lamenta la falta de compromiso de una parte de la plantilla, especialmente por el incremento del absentismo. Según explica, antes de la pandemia el absentismo en su empresa rondaba entre el 3 y el 4 %, mientras que ahora se sitúa entre el 8 y el 10 %, una tendencia que también se observa en el conjunto del país.

El directivo afirma que actualmente muchos trabajadores se ausentan incluso con síntomas leves, algo que no ocurría años atrás, y apunta que la eliminación del requisito de acudir al médico para justificar bajas cortas ha generado un abuso del sistema.

Este comentario se produce en un momento en el que el expresidente estadounidense se enfrenta a varias controversias internas, entre ellas las peticiones para desclasificar documentos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein. La anexión de Groenlandia, que es rica en recursos naturales y clave para la geopolítica del Ártico, ha sido un tema recurrente para Trump.

A raíz de esta denuncia, los CLER piden que los responsables sean puestos a disposición judicial y que las donaciones desviadas sean canalizadas hacia ONG y asociaciones locales con criterios éticos y de justicia social.

Magamedrasúlov relató cómo un grupo de unos 15 agentes fuertemente armados irrumpieron en su casa, lo golpearon y sometieron a tortura. A pesar de identificarse como miembro del NABU, fue tratado como un criminal peligroso. Este incidente ha generado preocupación sobre el uso de la violencia para frenar las investigaciones anticorrupción en Ucrania, especialmente aquellas que implican a personas cercanas al presidente Volodímir Zelenski.

Sin embargo, el PNV considera que los propietarios también necesitan ser protegidos con un 'doble escudo social', dado que muchos de estos propietarios se ven obligados a asumir situaciones de vulnerabilidad ajenas a ellos. La portavoz del PNV, Maribel Vaquero, ha señalado que la medida busca evitar que los propietarios de viviendas en alquiler se vean forzados a retirar sus propiedades del mercado debido al riesgo económico y social que implica alquilar a personas vulnerables sin garantías.

Nuevos estudios ponen en duda esta hipótesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Titán, la luna de Saturno, ha sido durante mucho tiempo uno de los principales objetivos de estudio debido a la presencia de sus mares y lagos de metano en la superficie. Sin embargo, la posibilidad de que Titán cuente con un océano interno global ha sido cuestionada por nuevos estudios que analizan los datos obtenidos por la sonda Cassini. En el pasado, los científicos pensaban que debajo de la corteza de Titán existía un océano de agua líquida, tal vez mezclado con amoniaco. Este océano se pensaba que tenía un grosor de alrededor de 250 kilómetros y estaba separado de la superficie por una capa de hielo. Pero recientes investigaciones sobre el momento de inercia de la luna, que mide su respuesta a las mareas ejercidas por Saturno, sugieren que podría no existir un océano global, sino varias capas de hielo de agua en diferentes estados de fusión, lo que implicaría que los mecanismos de deformación de la corteza no se explican por un océano líquido.

Además de la grave desatención física, se ha constatado un abandono emocional y espiritual, marcado por el temor y el sufrimiento de las monjas, algunas de las cuales expresaron haber sido víctimas de abusos físicos. La situación fue provocada por un cisma interno en la comunidad religiosa que aisló a las monjas mayores de la autoridad de la Federación de Clarisas.

Estos satélites dejan trazas visibles en las imágenes de los telescopios espaciales, lo que afecta la calidad de las observaciones científicas. Se estima que en 2040 habrá medio millón de satélites en órbita baja (LEO), lo que impactará seriamente a misiones como el telescopio Hubble y el observatorio SPHEREx. El aumento de tamaño y brillo de los satélites, especialmente los nuevos Starlink v2 Mini, los hace más problemáticos para los telescopios. A pesar de que el problema no es urgente aún, las futuras misiones de exploración del cielo podrían ver un aumento significativo en la contaminación por satélites.

El prototipo, basado en un ciclo Stirling termoacústico, logra temperaturas extremas sin recurrir a la combustión ni compresión mecánica. Este avance no solo mejora la eficiencia energética, sino que también abre la puerta a nuevas aplicaciones industriales, especialmente en sectores como la metalurgia y la petroquímica, que requieren calor a altas temperaturas. Además, la bomba de calor termoacústica tiene el potencial de reciclar calor residual de procesos industriales, lo que contribuiría a reducir el desperdicio de energía en China, donde se pierde entre un 10% y un 27% de la energía en forma de calor residual]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr: de pionera en el cine a inventora clave del WiFi]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr, nacida en Viena en 1914, fue una mujer que rompió moldes tanto en el cine como en la ciencia. A los 19 años, protagonizó la película 'Éxtasis', donde realizó el primer desnudo integral en la historia del cine y simuló un orgasmo, lo que causó gran escándalo en su época. Posteriormente, Lamarr pasó a ser esposa de Fritz Mandl, un magnate armamentístico que la sometió a un control extremo, lo que la llevó a huir a Hollywood. En Estados Unidos, fue renombrada como Hedy Lamarr y se convirtió en una de las grandes divas de la pantalla. Sin embargo, su verdadera pasión estaba en la ciencia. Durante sus noches de descanso, Lamarr desarrolló una tecnología que más tarde sería fundamental para la creación de WiFi, Bluetooth y otros avances en telecomunicaciones. Aunque en su época se le valoró más por su belleza que por su inteligencia, hoy se reconoce su legado como una innovadora tecnológica, recibiendo premios póstumos como el Pioner Award.

En su intervención durante la cumbre anual de la organización, celebrada en el Gaylord Palms Hotel de Kissimmee, Ladapo destacó la importancia de que los padres puedan tomar decisiones médicas sobre las vacunas de sus hijos. También instó a los miembros de la organización a colaborar con los legisladores de Tallahassee para modificar las leyes estatales y derogar las obligaciones de vacunación. Sin embargo, la propuesta se enfrenta a críticas, ya que algunos expertos en salud y ciudadanos temen que el relajamiento de los mandatos pueda aumentar los riesgos de enfermedades prevenibles. A pesar de ello, varios padres en la cumbre expresaron su apoyo a un mayor control parental sobre las decisiones de vacunación.

Su obra ha sido rescatada en una antología llamada 'Lo peor de Vázquez', que recopila sus trabajos desde finales de los años 70 hasta su última etapa en Glénat. Vázquez, conocido por su vida bohemia y su pasión por el bingo, se destacó por su capacidad para hacer reír a públicos de todas las edades, utilizando un trazo ágil y una comedia incisiva. Su estilo irreverente, que en ocasiones rozaba lo políticamente incorrecto, ha perdurado con el paso del tiempo, siendo aún hoy una referencia en el cómic español. La recopilación, que cuenta con textos de Antoni Giral, muestra un Vázquez más maduro y libre, capaz de manejar estereotipos y burlarse de la corrección social. Este volumen es ideal para los que quieren conocer la faceta más irreverente de Vázquez, una obra que ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-irreverente-genialidad-de-manuel-vazquez-una-retrospectiva-de-su-obra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-irreverente-genialidad-de-manuel-vazquez-una-retrospectiva-de-su-obra</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 02:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Condenan a dos limpiadoras por acosar a su compañera con enanismo durante casi dos años]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dos mujeres que trabajaban como empleadas del servicio de limpieza en un consultorio de Benidorm han sido condenadas a seis meses de prisión por burlarse de manera constante de una compañera con acondroplasia, una condición que provoca enanismo. Durante el período de acoso, que abarcó desde diciembre de 2020 hasta julio de 2022, las acusadas realizaron diversas humillaciones, como llamarla 'la enana', hacer comentarios degradantes sobre su discapacidad e incluso intentar hacerle creer que había sido contratada por un circo. Además de la pena de prisión, cada una deberá pagar una indemnización de 6.000 euros a la víctima por los daños morales causados. El tribunal considera que el comportamiento de las acusadas no puede considerarse como una simple broma, sino como un acoso reiterado que causó una grave persecución hacia la víctima. La sentencia también incluye una medida de alejamiento de tres años y medio hacia la perjudicada. El juicio ha dado lugar a controversia, ya que una tercera]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/condenan-a-dos-limpiadoras-por-acosar-a-su-companera-con-enanismo-durante-casi-dos-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/condenan-a-dos-limpiadoras-por-acosar-a-su-companera-con-enanismo-durante-casi-dos-anos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La reforma educativa de Milei: un giro hacia la privatización y el poder de las familias]]></title><description><![CDATA[El gobierno de Javier Milei en Argentina propone una reforma educativa radical que cambia profundamente el rol del Estado en la educación pública. La Ley de Libertad Educativa establece que el Estado debe actuar solo como garante del derecho a la educación, sin sustituir la responsabilidad de las familias. Se autoriza la enseñanza en el hogar y se promueve la competencia entre instituciones educativas para captar alumnos mediante financiamiento de la demanda, es decir, el dinero público irá a las familias para que elijan la escuela de su preferencia. Esto implica que el sistema educativo público perdería parte de su carácter gratuito y obligatorio. Las escuelas públicas y privadas podrán diseñar sus propios planes de estudio, y las familias tendrán poder para decidir sobre la dirección de las instituciones. Sin embargo, esta reforma ha sido criticada por docentes y expertos, quienes alertan sobre el riesgo de desregularización, elitización y falta de socialización en la educación.

Las denunciantes argumentan que la divulgación de estos archivos sin las debidas protecciones legales vulnera sus derechos y compromete su privacidad. La situación ha generado un debate sobre la responsabilidad del gobierno en la gestión de información confidencial y la protección de las víctimas de delitos sexuales. Además, se cuestiona si se siguieron los procedimientos legales adecuados al hacer públicos los documentos.

Este pacto implica ceder a varias de las demandas ideológicas del partido de Santiago Abascal, como el control más estricto de la inmigración ilegal registrada en el padrón municipal y la eliminación de las multas en la Zona de Bajas Emisiones de la Cartuja. Vox, que ya había apoyado los presupuestos de 2025, exige que en la ciudad se perciban más claramente sus principios ideológicos. Además, se han aceptado varias enmiendas propuestas por Vox, que incluyen un incremento de partidas sociales, como la ampliación del cheque bebé y la construcción de un espacio conmemorativo para niños no nacidos.

A través de la narrativa de Jake Sully y Neytiri, la película se presenta no solo como una batalla entre Na’vi y humanos, sino como una exploración de las dinámicas de poder dentro del hogar. El texto sostiene que la tercera entrega desplaza el foco del conflicto exterior hacia una cuestión íntima: ¿cómo educar a los hijos en un mundo que los percibe como una anomalía? Se exploran paralelismos con obras como Gran Torino, American History X y To Kill a Mockingbird, para sostener la idea de que el racismo no se transmite únicamente como ideología, sino como estructura familiar que se reproduce. La crítica señala la incomodidad que provoca la representación de Ash People, una tribu Na’vi asociada al fuego, que desafía la narrativa liberal de la opresión como algo externo.

Este hallazgo contradice la creencia popular de que los motores de combustión son más eficientes. Según Johannes Kückens, físico alemán, los motores de combustión nunca podrán superar un 45% de eficiencia debido a las leyes de la termodinámica, mientras que los motores eléctricos pueden alcanzar cifras cercanas al 90%. A pesar de los avances en la tecnología de los vehículos de combustión, la eficiencia energética sigue siendo muy limitada. Kückens también criticó la apuesta de la Unión Europea por los biocombustibles o e-fuels, señalando que, con la misma cantidad de electricidad, un coche eléctrico puede recorrer seis veces más distancia que uno alimentado con e-fuels.

A lo largo de su carrera, el cantante ha defendido la importancia de la clase obrera y se mostró sorprendido por el rechazo actual a que alguien se llame a sí mismo 'obrero'. En su opinión, los trabajadores deberían sentirse orgullosos de su labor, ya que son los que hacen avanzar a la sociedad.

Las resoluciones judiciales no consideran que se haya producido un delito de acoso, al entender que las concentraciones, que incluían rezos y mensajes antiabortistas, no fueron suficientemente intimidatorias ni coactivas. Sin embargo, las expertas advierten sobre la ineficacia de la legislación actual para frenar el acoso ambiental y abogan por la creación de 'zonas de seguridad' alrededor de las clínicas. La reforma del Código Penal en 2022 introdujo un tipo de delito específico para tratar de frenar el acoso antiabortista, pero las sentencias sugieren que este tipo de conductas no encajan con los nuevos tipos penales, lo que dificulta la aplicación efectiva de la ley.

Los autores destacan que esta decisión, al mantener la resolución de la Quinta Corte, podría debilitar el alcance de la Primera Enmienda y abrir la puerta a una ampliación de las prohibiciones de libros en todo el país. Se subraya que los esfuerzos de censura han aumentado en las últimas décadas y que las campañas suelen dirigir sus tácticas hacia comunidades rurales, con un fuerte énfasis en obras que tratan temas de raza, género y sexualidad, especialmente aquellas escritas por autores negros y LGBTQ+.

Su visión, basada en un análisis profundo de las contradicciones internas de la sociedad estadounidense, predice que la nación se encuentra en una crisis interna que podría llevar a su colapso. A través de su libro *America Against America*, Wang expone cómo la tensión entre el colectivismo y el individualismo, así como la mercantilización extrema de la sociedad, son factores que erosionan la cohesión interna de Estados Unidos. Además, propone que China, bajo el liderazgo de Xi Jinping, puede ofrecer una alternativa política que desafíe el modelo estadounidense. Este pensamiento es clave para entender las dinámicas de poder entre Pekín y Washington, especialmente en lo que respecta a la cuestión de Taiwán.

Entre los afectados se encuentran empresas españolas, que enfrentarán un recargo del 28,6%, tras cooperar en la investigación. Esta decisión afecta a productos como quesos frescos, cuajadas y leche, con España como uno de los principales exportadores afectados. Las exportaciones de lácteos españoles a China fueron de unos 82 millones de euros en 2024, lo que hace que la medida tenga un impacto económico considerable. Además, la medida se enmarca en un contexto de creciente tensión comercial entre la UE y China, con la reciente disputa sobre los aranceles a los vehículos eléctricos. El resultado final de la investigación podría dar lugar a aranceles definitivos, lo que incrementaría aún más la presión sobre el comercio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-establece-aranceles-provisionales-para-lacteos-europeos-tras-investigar-subvenciones-estatales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-establece-aranceles-provisionales-para-lacteos-europeos-tras-investigar-subvenciones-estatales</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA impone un límite de 100 horas mensuales de juego en GeForce NOW desde 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[A partir del 1 de enero de 2026, NVIDIA GeForce NOW limitará el tiempo de uso mensual de su servicio de juego en la nube a 100 horas. Este cambio afectará a todos los usuarios, independientemente de su suscripción, y es una medida destinada a gestionar mejor los recursos y reducir los tiempos de espera. NVIDIA asegura que el 94% de sus usuarios no superan ese límite, pero este cambio podría afectar a aquellos que juegan más de 3-4 horas al día. Para los usuarios más intensivos, se ofrecerán paquetes adicionales de 15 horas por 2,99 dólares en el plan Performance y 5,99 dólares en el plan Ultimate. Aunque el coste del servicio sigue siendo competitivo, este ajuste puede generar frustración, ya que los jugadores que ya pagan por un servicio de alta calidad preferirían tener acceso sin limitaciones. Este movimiento también se enmarca en un contexto de aumento de los precios de hardware y una mayor demanda de servidores en la nube.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nvidia-impone-un-limite-de-100-horas-mensuales-de-juego-en-geforce-now-desde-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nvidia-impone-un-limite-de-100-horas-mensuales-de-juego-en-geforce-now-desde-2026</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La prensa de la derecha continúa elogiando sin tregua a Ayuso durante la Navidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[La relación entre Isabel Díaz Ayuso y los medios de comunicación de la derecha ha alcanzado niveles sorprendentes, especialmente en fechas navideñas.

Titulares como el de La Razón, que califica su atuendo para visitar el Belén Viviente de Buitrago de Lozoya como 'perfecto', reflejan este culto a la figura de Ayuso. La situación ha generado críticas en las redes sociales, donde se han compartido reacciones que cuestionan la falta de objetividad y el tono servil de estos medios. En un contexto donde el protagonismo mediático de Ayuso parece no tener fin, muchos se preguntan hasta qué punto esta relación entre la política y la prensa está trastocando la función crítica del periodismo.

Su construcción, iniciada en 2006, buscaba atraer a miles de inversores extranjeros, especialmente chinos, para crear una ciudad moderna y habitada por 700,000 personas. Sin embargo, diversos factores, como cambios políticos, la crisis del mercado inmobiliario chino, restricciones por la pandemia y la caída de los precios del sector, dejaron a la ciudad en una espiral de vacío y desilusión. Hoy, Forest City alberga a tan solo 10,000 personas en más de 30,000 viviendas, con grandes rascacielos deshabitados y centros comerciales cerrados.

La familia ha confirmado que murió en un hospital tras una breve enfermedad. Rea, quien fusionó blues, pop, soul y soft rock a lo largo de su carrera, vendió más de 30 millones de discos y dejó un legado musical significativo, especialmente en España durante los años 80.

Nació en Middlesbrough, Inglaterra, en 1951, y desde joven mostró interés por la música, trabajando en una heladería para poder comprar su primera guitarra. A pesar de enfrentarse a la irrupción del punk rock, logró varios éxitos en su carrera, destacando en Estados Unidos con su canción 'Fool (If You Think It’s Over)'.

Mientras el transporte por tren se volvía cada vez más puntual, las diferencias horarias entre poblaciones podían ser de hasta 45 minutos, como ocurría entre Barcelona y A Coruña. Este desajuste se convirtió en un desafío para el funcionamiento de los trenes, que necesitaban horarios más precisos para evitar accidentes. Fue así como se propuso la unificación de la hora, una medida que surgió en Inglaterra y que, poco a poco, fue adoptada en otros países. El sistema se basaba en el horario de Greenwich, que se convirtió en la referencia mundial. En España, la primera normativa se implementó en 1859, estableciendo que las estaciones ferroviarias debían ajustarse a la hora de Madrid. Este proceso, que comenzó con la sincronización de los relojes de las estaciones, culminó en 1900 con la adopción de un huso horario nacional. Así, el ferrocarril]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercadona pierde juicio por despido improcedente tras acusar a trabajadora de comer platos preparados]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una ex trabajadora de Mercadona ha conseguido que se declare improcedente su despido, después de ser acusada de consumir platos preparados al final de su jornada laboral.

El testimonio de dos excompañeras que aseguraban haber presenciado los hechos, así como fotografías de los presuntos restos de comida, fueron las pruebas presentadas por la empresa. Sin embargo, la trabajadora no reconoció los hechos y llevó a Mercadona a los tribunales, rechazando una oferta de 1.000 euros a cambio de admitir su culpabilidad. En el juicio, el Juzgado de lo Social de Terrassa consideró que las pruebas eran poco creíbles, ya que las declaraciones de las excompañeras no resultaron convincentes y existió un conflicto previo entre ellas.

Aunque a corto plazo la acción dificultó un avance japonés hacia Shaanxi y Sichuan, el costo humano fue extremo y generó resentimiento rural hacia el régimen de Nanjing, que terminó reconociendo su responsabilidad en 1945.

En su lugar, Elma Saiz asume la Portavocía del Gobierno y Milagros Tolón se convierte en la nueva ministra de Educación. Estos cambios se producen en un contexto de fuertes reacciones políticas tras las elecciones autonómicas en Extremadura, donde el PSOE obtuvo el peor resultado de su historia, perdiendo diez escaños y quedando muy por detrás del PP, liderado por María Guardiola. La Ejecutiva del PSOE en Extremadura evalúa la posible dimisión de su secretario general, Miguel Ángel Gallardo, después de los malos resultados, con la posibilidad de conformar una gestora hasta un congreso extraordinario.

Según los propios miembros de la organización, la intervención no tenía intenciones de generar confrontación, sino de aprovechar la atención pública que genera el evento para impulsar la discusión de una propuesta solidaria. La proposición pretende que los fondos recaudados por el Sorteo de Navidad se destinen a fines humanitarios para los afectados en la Franja de Gaza.

En una rueda de prensa realizada en Buenos Aires, Kast afirmó que cualquier acción destinada a terminar con lo que él denominó una 'narcodictadura' en Venezuela contaría con el respaldo de Chile, aunque subrayó que su país no podría intervenir directamente debido a su tamaño. Kast criticó a Nicolás Maduro, acusándolo de robar las elecciones y de negarse a permitir el regreso de los migrantes venezolanos, además de promover el envío de remesas desde el extranjero. El presidente electo chileno también sugirió que una intervención estadounidense podría resolver un 'problema gigantesco' en toda América Latina. Estas declaraciones refuerzan su postura en defensa de medidas drásticas contra el narcotráfico y el control de la migración irregular en su país, durante su campaña electoral.

Sin embargo, el FBI no tomó medidas en ese momento y pasaron casi diez años antes de que Epstein comenzara a ser investigado seriamente. Farmer había denunciado que Epstein había robado fotos de sus hermanas menores y las había distribuido, además de hacerle amenazas para que no hablara. A pesar de los esfuerzos de Farmer por alertar a las autoridades, no recibió respuesta. Recientemente, los archivos desclasificados han confirmado que la denuncia fue ignorada. Este descubrimiento ha generado críticas hacia el FBI y otras agencias gubernamentales, que no tomaron en serio las alertas sobre el comportamiento de Epstein y su círculo cercano.

En el siglo XV, el filólogo Lorenzo Valla desmanteló este fraude, demostrando que el texto era anacrónico y había sido escrito siglos después de la supuesta fecha de emisión. Valla, a través del análisis filológico, señaló errores gramaticales, vocabulario inadecuado y referencias históricas imposibles para la época de Constantino, como la mención de Constantinopla antes de su fundación. Su estudio fue mucho más que una crítica académica, ya que tenía un trasfondo político, pues Valla trabajaba para el monarca aragonés Alfonso V, quien tenía disputas con el Papa. Este descubrimiento no solo debilitó el poder papal sobre los territorios italianos, sino que marcó el inicio de la crítica histórica y la utilización del análisis riguroso de textos en la investigación histórica.

Familias con ingresos estables se ven obligadas a abandonar sus viviendas debido a los aumentos desproporcionados del alquiler, que en ocasiones superan el 100%.

Sonia, madre de tres hijos, ha visto cómo su alquiler pasó de 800 a 1.400 euros, una subida insostenible para su familia.

Además, critica las propuestas de aumentar la velocidad en los trenes de alta velocidad entre Madrid y Barcelona, señalando que la solución no está en la velocidad, sino en aumentar el número de trenes disponibles para mejorar la capacidad.

La hija de Burton denunció que su madre sufrió un grave deterioro tras el error médico, presentando dificultades físicas y psicológicas. La familia ha interpuesto una demanda exigiendo compensación por los daños causados, mientras que el hospital se ha limitado a declarar que el incidente está siendo investigado.

El apagón interrumpió el comercio, el transporte y servicios públicos, provocando que varios comercios cerraran antes de lo previsto y que los semáforos dejaran de funcionar, lo que causó caos en las calles. La empresa Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) restauró parcialmente el servicio a unas 90.000 viviendas, pero unas 40.000 seguían sin electricidad hasta el domingo por la mañana. Las autoridades locales pidieron a los ciudadanos que se quedaran en casa y ayudaran a quienes lo necesiten.

Sin embargo, su viaje hacia el Reino Unido se convirtió en una pesadilla, donde fue obligada a ejercer la prostitución a manos de traficantes de personas. En las rutas migratorias, las mujeres enfrentan no solo los peligros inherentes al viaje, como la violencia, sino una explotación sexual sistemática por parte de los traficantes. Aunque los migrantes en general deben pagar a los traficantes, a las mujeres se les exige un tipo de 'pago' mucho más cruel: servicios sexuales forzados. La violencia sexual es una de las amenazas más devastadoras para las mujeres migrantes, y la falta de protección y apoyo durante su travesía por Libia y otros territorios las pone aún más vulnerables. Organizaciones como la OIM alertan sobre el aumento de mujeres migrantes solas, y la situación se ve agravada por la violencia de género que muchas de ellas experimentan antes y durante su traves]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-sufrimiento-oculto-de-las-mujeres-migrantes-explotacion-sexual-y-trafico-de-personas-en-su-ruta-hacia-europa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-sufrimiento-oculto-de-las-mujeres-migrantes-explotacion-sexual-y-trafico-de-personas-en-su-ruta-hacia-europa</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vínculos entre viñetas y denuncia: ¿ha cambiado la cobertura del conflicto Palestina]]></title><description><![CDATA[La revisión periodística destaca una supuesta reducción en la cobertura visual y gráfica del conflicto palestino, señalando que imágenes y viñetas de denuncia han perdido espacio en portadas, telediarios y feeds.

A partir de octubre de 2025, tras un supuesto alto el fuego acordado entre Hamas e Israel y un plan de paz de puntos conocido como el plan estadounidense de Trump, la atención mediática habría disminuido, a pesar de que el conflicto continúa y que Israel incumple el alto el fuego.

Desde la nacionalización parcial de la industria petrolera en 1976 hasta la llegada de Hugo Chávez en 1998, el país ha sido testigo de una lucha constante por el control de sus recursos. La Revolución Bolivariana de Chávez, que impulsó la soberanía sobre el petróleo, fue vista como una amenaza directa a los intereses económicos y geopolíticos de EE.UU.

Trump ha mostrado una postura agresiva hacia la Unión Europea, imponiendo sanciones, aranceles y amenazas contra empresas europeas, mientras difunde una narrativa despectiva hacia el proyecto europeo. El artículo destaca las tensiones comerciales y políticas, como la negativa de las empresas estadounidenses a cumplir con las normativas europeas, y las amenazas de Washington de imponer restricciones adicionales. Según Dans, Europa debe dejar de ser un socio pasivo y tomar medidas claras para defender sus intereses, incluyendo el uso de herramientas económicas y tecnológicas.

La movilización masiva de reservistas, la destrucción de viviendas y negocios, y una creciente dependencia de los préstamos extranjeros han puesto a la economía israelí al borde del colapso. El gasto militar ha sido el principal motor económico, pero este modelo parece insostenible a largo plazo. El país ha visto un aumento significativo en la pobreza y la inseguridad alimentaria, mientras que sectores clave como la educación y la sanidad se deterioran debido a la desviación de recursos hacia la guerra. A pesar de estos problemas, algunos indicadores, como la apreciación del shekel y los récords en la Bolsa de Tel Aviv, sugieren que la economía aún funciona, pero solo gracias a un gasto público masivo y el endeudamiento externo.

Entre las medidas aprobadas se incluyen la prohibición de desahucios sin alternativa habitacional, la suspensión de cortes de suministros básicos como electricidad, agua y gas, y la prórroga del bono social eléctrico. Este acuerdo es visto como una respuesta a las crecientes dificultades económicas de muchas familias, y se considera como un avance para garantizar una red mínima de protección social. Además, la extensión del escudo social se presenta como una de las primeras pruebas parlamentarias para el Gobierno en 2026, lo que añade un desafío político adicional en un momento de debilidad gubernamental.

En condiciones de disfunción metabólica, como la enfermedad del hígado graso asociada a disfunción metabólica (MASLD), el hígado aumenta FGF21 para intentar restaurar el equilibrio. Los investigadores han descubierto que la acumulación de G3P activa ChREBP, lo que favorece la síntesis de grasa en el hígado y, a la vez, inhibe su quema. Este hallazgo sugiere que modulando la ruta G3P-ChREBP se podría controlar la producción de FGF21 y, por tanto, disminuir los antojos mientras se favorece la quema de grasa. Aunque el estudio aún se encuentra en fases iniciales, abre la puerta a posibles terapias que aprovechen esta vía para tratamientos de MASLD, disfunción metabólica y obesidad, y podría explicar por qué algunas personas delgadas padecen MASLD y muestran aversión a los dulces.

Por otro lado, los hombres prefieren actividades más físicas o tecnológicas, como los videojuegos o el gimnasio.

La coalición ha conseguido un 10,25% de los votos, un significativo aumento con respecto al 6,2% de las anteriores elecciones. A pesar de este crecimiento, el panorama político en la Asamblea de Extremadura sigue incierto, ya que el PP sigue consolidándose como la fuerza más votada, con el apoyo de Vox. De Miguel ha enfatizado que su objetivo es seguir luchando por los intereses de los extremeños, defendiendo los servicios públicos y las políticas feministas.

A partir de 2026, los propietarios que alquilen varias viviendas deberán pagar un IVA del 26% por cada alojamiento a partir del segundo, lo que representa un aumento significativo en comparación con el 21% actual para la primera propiedad. Esta medida se ha propuesto como parte de los presupuestos del próximo año y pretende regular de manera más estricta el mercado de alquiler vacacional, especialmente en un contexto de creciente preocupación por su impacto en el mercado de la vivienda. Además, se aplicarán nuevas restricciones fiscales a partir de la tercera vivienda, clasificando a los propietarios bajo un régimen empresarial que dificultará aún más la operativa para particulares.

Esta acción se produjo a finales de 2024, en medio del conflicto entre Israel y Gaza, debido a que los barcos transportaban armas destinadas a Israel. Aunque aún no se ha tomado una decisión final, la FMC está investigando las consecuencias económicas de esta política y está considerando imponer sanciones, como la denegación de acceso a los puertos o la aplicación de multas millonarias.

En estos vídeos, los concejales contrastan negocios 'nacionales' y 'extranjeros', utilizando símbolos nacionales y banderas de países como Marruecos o Pakistán, lo que refuerza el discurso del partido sobre la inmigración. Este tipo de mensajes es criticado por varios analistas, como el politólogo Oriol Bartomeus, quien lo compara con las campañas de señalamiento de comercios en la Alemania de los años 30. Bartomeus advierte que, aunque la campaña de Vox no menciona grandes cadenas de comida rápida extranjeras como McDonald's o Burger King, se centra únicamente en negocios pequeños regentados por inmigrantes, lo que refleja un problema de racismo y xenofobia.

Esta incautación se suma a otras 9 toneladas confiscadas en el Pacífico, elevando el total de droga incautada en menos de 48 horas a 27 toneladas.

De Wever, pese a no ser un euroescéptico, fue objeto de duras críticas y acusaciones desde Bruselas por su resistencia, lo que el artículo interpreta como un ejemplo del autoritarismo creciente dentro de las instituciones europeas.

En este proyecto, basado en los diarios de guerra de Lindgren, se explica que Pippi nació como una respuesta a los horrores de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el ascenso del nazismo. Durante esa época, Lindgren, que vivía en Suecia, fue testigo de las atrocidades cometidas por el régimen de Hitler, y su escritura se impregnó de una profunda preocupación por el autoritarismo y la opresión.

El desalojo se llevó a cabo en pleno invierno, sin ofrecer alternativas de vivienda a los afectados, lo que constituye una grave violación de los derechos humanos. Los expertos han destacado la falta de respuestas adecuadas por parte del gobierno local y han denunciado la retórica estigmatizante utilizada por las autoridades, que describieron a los migrantes como una fuente de inseguridad sin pruebas que lo demuestren. La mayoría de los desalojados provienen de África occidental y subsahariana, y muchos de ellos ya habían sido desplazados de otras áreas en el pasado. Aunque las autoridades locales ofrecieron alojamiento temporal a solo 30 personas vulnerables, la mayoría se enfrenta a la falta de refugio y alternativas, lo que los obliga a regresar a asentamientos informales o a vivir en la calle.

El relato se centra en el caso de Luisa Peinado, cuyo cáncer de mama mostró una falla en la comunicación y activación de protocolos médicos, lo que ilustra cómo una demora de un año puede transformarse en un cáncer metastásico y en una pérdida de confianza en el sistema sanitario. El texto sostiene que los responsables no atribuyen estas situaciones a errores aislados sino a decisiones políticas que reducen plantillas, no cubren bajas y derivan pruebas a la sanidad privada para disminuir listas de espera, con el resultado de más demoras y menos transparencia. Además, se denuncia la opacidad informativa, al no publicarse tiempos de espera de pruebas diagnósticas y la supresión de debates públicos sobre estas cifras.

Entre las imágenes premiadas, destaca un gorila en Ruanda haciendo acrobacias para impresionar a su grupo familiar, capturado por Mark Meth Cohn. En la categoría junior, Grayson Bell ganó por una foto de ranas verdes que parecía una escena de un bautismo improvisado. En la categoría de menores de 25 años, Paula Rustemeier obtuvo el primer premio con una divertida imagen de zorros rojos 'bailando' en los Países Bajos. Además, varias fotos capturaron momentos graciosos y únicos, como una ardilla con el pelo desordenado y un colimbo mostrando una flexibilidad impresionante.

Esta propuesta, apoyada recientemente por el Parlamento Europeo, busca la creación de un fondo europeo que financie los tratamientos abortivos en los países de la UE donde el aborto es legal, aunque no cubra los gastos de desplazamiento. Argüello lamenta que el Parlamento Europeo haya respaldado la propuesta y la califica como 'antinavidad'. Además, sostiene que el aborto representa 'el poder del fuerte sobre el débil', llamando a la sociedad a apoyar a las madres a través de una alianza social por la vida.

A lo largo de su carrera, se destacó por su labor en destapar las cloacas del Estado y la Policía Patriótica, un trabajo que la convirtió en una de las figuras más relevantes en la denuncia de las prácticas corruptas en las instituciones del país. López colaboró en medios como la revista 'Tiempo', 'Así son las cosas' y 'Diario Público', donde se especializó en investigaciones de gran calado, como el documental 'Las Cloacas del Interior', que desvelaba cómo las estructuras del poder político y policial se usaban para incriminar a opositores. Su trabajo, que le costó varias denuncias y amenazas legales, fue finalmente reconocido con el Premio Dignidad en 2017.

Los colegios implicados son Trinidad, San Rafael Obispo, Sansueña, Escuelas Pías de la Inmaculada, Jesús Nazareno y San Acisclo y Santa Victoria. La denuncia llegó tras dos quejas anónimas sobre posibles irregularidades en la gestión de fondos públicos destinados a la educación.

Originalmente, se iban a inscribir 553 nombres en el muro conmemorativo diseñado por el arquitecto Paul Raff, pero tras el aviso de grupos judíos y medios de comunicación canadienses, más de la mitad de los nombres fueron retirados por su posible relación con el nazismo o el fascismo.

Lem defiende su obra como un homenaje al héroe mesopotámico Gilgamesh, mientras que AsimoV le reprocha la pretensión de enmendar la obra de los grandes narradores del siglo XX. Casandra interviene, cuestionando las pretensiones de los autores, y Chess aporta una visión crítica sobre el impacto de Borges y otros maestros literarios en la imaginación.

'The Book' se distancia de los manuales de supervivencia al enfocarse en el ingenio humano y la creatividad para recrear una nueva sociedad. Con un enfoque artístico y poético, el libro no pretende ser una guía técnica, sino más bien una reflexión sobre cómo la humanidad podría reinventarse después de un colapso global.

Sin embargo, una de las ausencias más llamativas es la de Donald Trump, cuyo nombre aparece en los archivos previos pero ahora se omite en el reciente conjunto de documentos. En particular, una fotografía que mostraba a Trump, su esposa Melania, Epstein y Ghislaine Maxwell ha sido eliminada. Los demócratas, liderados por Chuck Schumer, han criticado la eliminación de material y sugieren que podría tratarse de un encubrimiento.

Saviano elogia la consistencia y el control de Djokovic, señalando que incluso Nadal ha admitido que nadie ha tenido el dominio de la bola como él, y describe cómo ese control se traduce en la capacidad de levantarse, ganar tiempo y mantener la iniciativa incluso cuando la colocación no es perfecta. A la vez, analiza el juego actual de jóvenes talentos, destacando a Jannik Sinner como un jugador de gran potencial pero con limitaciones en la gestión de puntos que pueden complicarle si no calibra altura de la bola y ubicación. En contraste, manifiesta una admiración clara por Carlos Alcaraz, a quien ve preparado para perdurar en la élite gracias a una combinación de recursos físicos, técnicos y mentales.

La emigración de jóvenes, la baja natalidad y el envejecimiento de la población son algunos de los factores que contribuyen al declive de esta comunidad. En las elecciones regionales del 21 de diciembre de 2025, los votantes se enfrentan a un dilema entre la integración de inmigrantes y las propuestas de partidos como Vox, que rechazan la inmigración irregular. Mientras tanto, partidos de izquierda defienden políticas inclusivas para la integración de los migrantes y la repoblación con personas extranjeras. A pesar de los esfuerzos por revitalizar el campo y mejorar las infraestructuras, el panorama sigue siendo incierto para muchos habitantes de las zonas rurales. Los jóvenes siguen emigrando, y las políticas públicas de la región deben centrarse en frenar este éxodo, mejorar la calidad de vida y crear oportunidades laborales.

La víctima, que no recuerda los hechos, fue encontrada inconsciente y desprovista de algunas pertenencias, siendo trasladada inmediatamente a un centro sanitario para recibir atención médica y psicológica. Inicialmente, la juez encargada del caso decidió su encarcelamiento por riesgo de fuga y posible ocultación de pruebas, dado que los cuatro investigados estaban en situación irregular y sin domicilio fijo. Entre los indicios, se mencionó la presencia de ropa de la víctima cerca de las tiendas donde residían los jóvenes, aunque estos señalaron que por la zona pasaba ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuatro-jovenes-quedan-en-libertad-tras-pruebas-de-adn-en-caso-de-agresion-sexual-en-pamplona</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuatro-jovenes-quedan-en-libertad-tras-pruebas-de-adn-en-caso-de-agresion-sexual-en-pamplona</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un navarro sobrevive a la ingesta de una seta mortal gracias a una rápida intervención médica]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre de Navarra ha sobrevivido a la ingestión accidental de la peligrosa Amanita phalloides, un hongo tóxico que puede ser mortal incluso en pequeñas cantidades. El afectado, M.U., confundió el hongo con una seta comestible y lo cocinó sin darse cuenta de su peligrosidad. Tras varios episodios de vómitos y diarrea, acudió al Hospital Universitario de Navarra, donde los médicos lo trataron y lo mantuvieron en observación. Sorprendentemente, su estado mejoró sin que se registraran daños en órganos vitales, lo que fue considerado un 'milagro médico'. A pesar de la gravedad de la intoxicación por Amanita phalloides, que puede causar fallos hepáticos y renales fatales, el hombre recibió el alta al cabo de dos días sin secuelas. El caso ha generado asombro entre los profesionales de la salud, quienes han destacado la excepcionalidad de la recuperación del paciente.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-navarro-sobrevive-a-la-ingesta-de-una-seta-mortal-gracias-a-una-rapida-intervencion-medica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-navarro-sobrevive-a-la-ingesta-de-una-seta-mortal-gracias-a-una-rapida-intervencion-medica</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El FMI concede un segundo waiver a Argentina por incumplimiento en las metas de reservas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) se encuentra en proceso de otorgar un segundo waiver consecutivo a la Argentina debido a que el país no ha alcanzado las metas de reservas internacionales pactadas. Este waiver permitirá que el gobierno argentino reciba un desembolso de aproximadamente 1.050 millones de dólares en enero de 2026. La situación de las reservas sigue siendo crítica, ya que el Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA) no ha logrado acumular suficientes divisas debido a una política monetaria inconsistente y a intervenciones cambiarias poco efectivas. El FMI subraya que, aunque el gobierno de Javier Milei ha implementado medidas económicas que buscan estabilizar la economía, la acumulación de reservas es esencial para la sostenibilidad del programa y la estabilidad financiera a largo plazo. El préstamo será clave para enfrentar los vencimientos de deuda que se avecinan en 2026, lo que refuerza la presión sobre la necesidad de lograr una recuperación económica sólid]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fmi-concede-un-segundo-waiver-a-argentina-por-incumplimiento-en-las-metas-de-reservas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fmi-concede-un-segundo-waiver-a-argentina-por-incumplimiento-en-las-metas-de-reservas</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El análisis histórico de la violencia en Zaragoza durante el golpe de 1936]]></title><description><![CDATA[La violencia política desencadenada en 1936 en España fue un elemento clave en la construcción del nuevo orden dictatorial. El historiador David Alegre, en su reciente trabajo 'Verdugos del 36, La maquinaria del terror en la Zaragoza golpista', profundiza en el análisis de los temores y teorías conspirativas de los golpistas, el grado de infiltración de Falange en las estructuras del gobierno republicano y cómo se organizó la violencia en la ciudad de Zaragoza. Alegre también explora el perfil de los perpetradores de este terrorismo de Estado, desde figuras destacadas hasta individuos menos conocidos que jugaron un papel crucial en la represión de aquellos meses clave de 1936. El programa 'La Linterna de Diógenes' aborda cómo los elementos de poder construyeron esta maquinaria de terror en el contexto del golpe de Estado y su impacto en la España del siglo XX.

Además, los manifestantes exigieron la prórroga del Escudo Social, que finaliza el 31 de diciembre, para evitar que 60.000 familias en toda España enfrenten el desahucio. El portavoz de Juntes per l'Habitatge, Pablo Ramos, destacó que las protestas continuarán hasta que las administraciones se comprometan con medidas reales y efectivas para resolver el problema de la vivienda.

Entre 2010 y 2012, Dati recibió 900.000 euros de Renault-Nissan, y en la misma línea, GDF Suez (actualmente Engie) pagó 299.000 euros a un despacho de abogados relacionado con la ministra.

En un mundo donde la privatización de los servicios médicos se intensifica, el acceso a la atención se ve restringido a aquellos con poder adquisitivo. Este proceso no es accidental; es un fenómeno político deliberado, que permite que una minoría se enriquezca a costa del sufrimiento de muchos. La falta de recursos en la sanidad pública, la saturación de consultas y listas de espera interminables están provocando muertes evitables. La privatización de la salud genera una cadena de sufrimiento, donde la vida humana queda subordinada a los intereses económicos. El autor denuncia esta situación como un crimen premeditado que tiene como víctimas a los más vulnerables, pues las muertes que ocurren hoy podrían haberse evitado con un sistema de salud eficiente y accesible para todos.

La narrativa se centra en cómo cada personaje construye su propia versión de los hechos: Simone ve en la niña una oportunidad de redención, Alba percibe una fisura que desafía sus códigos, y Fátima, la madre biológica, busca ofrecer una oportunidad. La prosa de Iglesias destaca por su precisión y observación de detalles cotidianos que revelan la complejidad de los vínculos humanos, desde gestos mínimos hasta objetos con significado íntimo. La novela también aborda de manera sutil la dimensión económica de estas decisiones, reflejada en intercambios de dinero y promesas que no pueden cumplirse.

Israel, según el autor, está diseñando un modelo para tratar a los sectores 'sobrantes' de la población en un futuro con recursos limitados y un clima hostil. Este modelo, que ya se aplica en Palestina, está basado en la vigilancia masiva, el control social a través de la tecnología y la militarización de la policía, lo que podría extenderse a las sociedades occidentales.

En la zona de La Coruña, los empleados de una sucursal bancaria fueron sometidos a una concentración de gas radón de 17.000 Bq/m³, lo que se traduce en una dosis anual equivalente a 428 mSv. Esta cifra es alarmante, ya que supera significativamente las exposiciones típicas en trabajadores de áreas como la radioterapia o la industria nuclear. Aunque los límites legales para la exposición a la radiación en estos sectores están bien definidos, la exposición a radón, un gas radiactivo procedente de la desintegración del uranio en las rocas, no siempre es tomada en cuenta con la misma seriedad. Este problema, que afecta a muchas zonas con construcciones antiguas, se debe a la falta de conciencia y acción por parte de las ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-peligros-invisibles-de-la-radiacion-exposicion-al-radon-en-lugares-inesperados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-peligros-invisibles-de-la-radiacion-exposicion-al-radon-en-lugares-inesperados</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 22:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El TSJ de Madrid declara que seis ginecólogas de Quirónsalud no eran autónomas, sino trabajadoras dependientes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid ha sentenciado que seis ginecólogas que trabajaban en el Hospital Universitario Quirónsalud Madrid no eran autónomas, como se había estipulado en sus contratos, sino trabajadoras dependientes de la empresa Onginex SL. Esta decisión pone en evidencia el modelo de subcontratación empleado en la sanidad privada, en el que se recurren a contratos mercantiles para médicos que, en la práctica, realizan tareas propias de empleados con un horario y condiciones fijadas por la empresa. La sentencia, que aún no es firme, tiene implicaciones significativas para la sanidad privada, especialmente en Quirónsalud, y podría afectar a otros profesionales sanitarios que se encuentren en situaciones similares.

Este hecho se enmarca en una serie de medidas diseñadas para presionar a actores que, según Washington, facilitan violaciones de sanciones o beneficios de regímenes sancionados.

Según datos del Banco Mundial, por primera vez, en 2024, la clase media mexicana supera el porcentaje de personas en situación de pobreza. Mientras que el 39.6% de la población se encuentra en la clase media, solo el 21.7% vive en condiciones de pobreza. Sheinbaum atribuye este cambio a las políticas públicas implementadas por la Cuarta Transformación (4T), que incluyen los Programas del Bienestar y aumentos al salario mínimo. A pesar de los desafíos económicos globales, México ha logrado una reducción de la pobreza del 13.6%, mientras que la clase media ha crecido un 12.4%. Estos avances han sido fundamentales para que México sea uno de los países de América Latina que más ha reducido la pobreza en los últimos años, según un informe de la Cepal.

Según Assange, Machado apoya las acciones de Donald Trump en Venezuela, lo que contravendría los principios establecidos por el testamento del fundador. En la denuncia, Assange también solicitaba el bloqueo del cheque de 11 millones de coronas (aproximadamente 1 millón de dólares) prometido a Machado, argumentando que los fondos podían ser desviados para apoyar la agresión y los crímenes de guerra. La policía sueca, sin embargo, no encontró pruebas que sugirieran la comisión de un delito y, por lo tanto, no iniciará ninguna investigación.

Si en 1957, el premio de 3 millones de pesetas permitía comprar 10 pisos y 10 coches, hoy, el mismo premio, una vez descontados los impuestos, se queda en 328.000 euros, lo que da para mucho menos. A lo largo de las décadas, el aumento del precio de los décimos no ha sido suficiente para compensar la subida general de los precios, lo que ha reducido el poder adquisitivo de los premiados. A partir de 2011, el importe del premio se congeló en 400.000 euros y, desde 2013, los premios tributan, lo que ha hecho que los 328.000 euros actuales se queden aún más lejos de lo que un décimo de la Lotería de Navidad representaba en el pasado. Los loteros, que aseguran que sus márgenes también se han visto reducidos, han pedido un aumento tanto en el importe del primer premio como en el precio del décimo, que no se ha actualizado desde la introducción del euro en 2002.

La versión se caracteriza por un enfoque visual y auditivo que lleva la pieza clásica a un terreno completamente nuevo, pero respetando la estructura original.

Se argumenta que la frustración y el hartazgo político llevan a fantasear con un régimen que ofrezca claridad y orden, pero advierte que la experiencia histórica de la autocracia demuestra que ese supuesto beneficio es ilusorio: concentración de poder, represión de la disidencia y la eliminación de controles. Recalca que España, pese a sus fallos y desafíos, mantiene instituciones que permiten denunciar abusos, independencia judicial y tutela europea, mecanismos que dificultan una deriva autoritaria.

A lo largo de su historia, el Tu-160 ha incorporado avances tecnológicos significativos, como el sistema fly-by-wire, materiales de alta resistencia y un arsenal que incluye misiles de crucero típicamente con capacidad nuclear. Su producción se vio limitada por la disolución de la URSS, pero la flota rusa ha mantenido varias unidades en servicio, con planes de modernización y continuidad operativa hasta años recientes. La aeronave ha participado en ejercicios y misiones que subrayan su papel dual de potencia estratégica y capacidad de ataque de largo alcance, estableciendo un marco co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tupolev-tu-160-historia-especificaciones-y-servicio-actual</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tupolev-tu-160-historia-especificaciones-y-servicio-actual</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 16:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LOS QUE FINANCIARON A FRANCO]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo analiza los actores y las entidades que, a través de sus aportaciones económicas, apoyaron la dictadura de Francisco Franco durante la Guerra Civil española y los primeros años de su régimen.

La autora señala que, aunque las donaciones de gobiernos o entidades extranjeras están prohibidas, no existe una restricción clara para personas individuales, lo que crea un escenario de vulnerabilidad. Además, se menciona el caso de Vox, que ha acogido con agrado el apoyo del movimiento MAGA de Donald Trump, y se plantea la preocupación de que intereses ajenos puedan influir en las elecciones españolas. A raíz de este análisis, la autora propone una reforma legislativa para que España prohíba definitivamente las donaciones extranjeras, garantizando así la independencia y soberanía política del país. Se hace hincapié en que, si bien el sistema estadounidense también presenta problemas de financiación política, las donaciones extranjeras deberían se]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-necesidad-de-prohibir-las-donaciones-extranjeras-a-los-partidos-politicos-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-necesidad-de-prohibir-las-donaciones-extranjeras-a-los-partidos-politicos-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 16:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EEUU plantea sancionar a España por impedir escalas de buques con armamento destinado a Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Comisión Federal Marítima (FMC) de Estados Unidos ha propuesto cerrar sus puertos a buques españoles debido a la negativa del gobierno de España a permitir que buques estadounidenses, cargados con armamento para Israel, hagan escala en el puerto de Algeciras (Cádiz). Este incidente, ocurrido en noviembre de 2024, ha desencadenado una investigación por parte de la FMC, que está considerando diversas medidas como la imposición de multas de hasta 2,3 millones de dólares por viaje a los buques de bandera española. Aunque no se ha tomado una decisión final, la FMC está evaluando el impacto que la política española de denegación de escalas tiene sobre el comercio exterior estadounidense y está solicitando información adicional de transportistas y comerciantes.

Como parte de los llamados 'niños de la guerra', recibió una prestación española tras la ley 3/2005 para compensar la expatriación forzosa durante la infancia. Tras décadas en Rusia, donde trabajó 40 años, volvió a España con su esposa, también rusa. En 2024-2025, y debido a las sanciones internacionales impuestas por la invasión de Ucrania, el cobro de la pensión rusa fue bloqueado por bancos y la administración rusa dejó de pagar; la opción ofrecida era viajar a Rusia para cobrarla, algo inviable por la edad. Con la cooperación del hijo en Finlandia, logran mantener ingresos mínimos gracias a una pensión española, pero hace unos meses la Seguridad Social suspendió dicha prestación por un trámite fuera de plazo y por una subsanación no tramitada correctamente.

Según un informe preliminar de la Policía Local de Palma, un testigo vio al conductor utilizando su móvil poco antes de que perdiera el control de su vehículo, un Mercedes, y arrollara a la familia. La pareja del implicado confirmó que el hombre conducía de manera errática antes del incidente, mencionando que incluso golpeó los bordillos. Las autoridades están analizando el móvil del conductor, que ha sido incautado, para determinar si la distracción fue la causa del atropello. El conductor dio negativo en las pruebas de alcohol y drogas y declaró que sufrió una indisposición mientras conducía.

Bonham falleció a los 32 años debido a una asfixia provocada por su propio vómito, un trágico desenlace que marcó el fin de la banda. Aunque la relación entre los miembros de Led Zeppelin ya arrastraba tensiones internas y problemas con las adicciones, la muerte de Bonham fue el golpe definitivo. La banda, conocida por su habilidad para mezclar géneros como el blues, el folk celta y los ritmos orientales, no vio posible continuar sin su batería, cuyo estilo único había sido fundamental en su sonido. En lugar de buscar un reemplazo, los miembros restantes decidieron poner fin a la historia de Led Zeppelin con una breve nota que decía: 'No podemos continuar como éramos'. Aunque la banda terminó oficialmente en 1980, su legado perdura hasta hoy, con conciertos recordados como el último de 1977 en Berlín y la posterior reuni]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fin-de-led-zeppelin-la-muerte-de-bonham-y-el-legado-perdurable-del-rock</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fin-de-led-zeppelin-la-muerte-de-bonham-y-el-legado-perdurable-del-rock</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La caída de la audiencia de la Fórmula 1 en España: ¿qué está detrás de la crisis en DAZN?]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fórmula 1 ha vivido en España sus mejores años gracias a Fernando Alonso, pero en 2025, las audiencias de este deporte en el país han descendido drásticamente. La media de espectadores en las transmisiones de DAZN fue de solo 430.000, lo que representa un 7,7 % de share, cifras muy alejadas de los 4,6 millones de espectadores en 2007, cuando Alonso estaba en su máximo esplendor. Esta pérdida de interés es atribuida a varios factores, entre ellos, el cambio en el modelo de transmisión de la F1, que dejó la televisión en abierto para mudarse a plataformas de pago como Movistar+ y DAZN. La piratería también ha jugado un papel importante, ya que muchos aficionados recurren a alternativas ilegales para ver las carreras sin pagar. A pesar de la alta calidad de los comentaristas, como Antonio Lobato y Pedro Martínez de la Rosa, DAZN no ha logrado enganchar a un público amplio.

Desde Microsoft con su integración de IA en Windows 11 hasta navegadores como Comet, Dia y Atlas, muchas empresas han apostado por incorporar la IA en sus servicios, sin embargo, esta tendencia no está siendo bien recibida por los usuarios. A pesar de las enormes inversiones realizadas en IA, la reacción general ha sido de fatiga y rechazo, ya que los consumidores no han pedido estas mejoras y consideran que la IA no ha supuesto ninguna revolución. De hecho, en el caso de Windows 11, la obsesión de Microsoft por meter IA en cada rincón del sistema ha provocado que muchos usuarios busquen maneras de eliminarla.

UU., Donald Trump, ha anunciado su plan para desmantelar el Centro Nacional de Investigación Atmosférica (NCAR), ubicado en Boulder, Colorado. Este centro es uno de los mayores centros de investigación científica en meteorología y cambio climático en el país. La decisión ha generado una gran preocupación entre científicos y autoridades locales, ya que el NCAR es crucial para la predicción de fenómenos extremos como huracanes, tormentas y otros desastres naturales. La administración de Trump justifica la medida alegando que el NCAR es un centro de ‘alarmismo climático’ y que sus funciones se trasladarán a otras entidades o ubicaciones. Sin embargo, la comunidad científica advierte que esta reorganización podría generar pérdidas de eficiencia en la predicción del tiempo y en la capacidad de respuesta ante desastres.

Otero también relató cómo el Gobierno de Suárez gestionó la legalización del Partido Comunista y los intereses de Washington durante esa época. Además, criticó la falta de acción contra la corrupción en el panorama político español y abordó otros temas como la resistencia de Felipe González a aceptar la monarquía y las tensiones internas dentro de UCD.

A medida que avanzaba en su trabajo, se percató de la presencia de la red, que estaba escondida entre los girasoles. Tras documentar el hallazgo en un vídeo, Luna mostró la situación en la que se encontraban las aves atrapadas, algunas muertas y otras aún vivas pero agotadas. Con cuidado, las liberó una por una, y algunas fueron trasladadas a un lugar seguro para su recuperación antes de ser soltadas nuevamente. La red, que representaba un peligro tanto para la fauna como para la maquinaria agrícola, fue retirada para evitar más daños. Esta práctica ilegal está prohibida en España y Europa, ya que no solo pone en riesgo a las aves, sino que también supone un peligro para los agricultores.

El hallazgo se logró gracias a una misión científico-técnica franco-española y el uso de tecnología avanzada, como sondas multifrecuencia y documentos históricos recuperados de las familias de los marinos. El submarino fue saboteado por su propia tripulación para evitar que cayera en manos aliadas durante la Operación Torch, una serie de desembarcos en el norte de África. Tras varios intentos fallidos de localización, el equipo de investigadores ha conseguido ubicar con precisión el lugar donde se hundió el Le Tonnant, lo que permite avanzar en el estudio de otros submarinos desaparecidos de la época.

Según su estimación, pasarán aproximadamente diez años antes de que se solucionen estos problemas y los agentes puedan operar de manera autónoma y confiable. Karpathy destacó que no busca un futuro en el que la IA haga a los humanos innecesarios; por el contrario, aboga por una colaboración entre humanos y agentes de IA, donde estos últimos ayuden a codificar y ejecutar tareas mientras los humanos aprenden y mejoran sus habilidades.

En el operativo resultaron detenidas 19 personas, principalmente por infracciones de extranjería, y se identificaron casi 200 residentes. El alcalde de Badalona, Xavier García Albiol (PP), ha insistido en que el lugar ha sido un foco de conflictos y violencia, citando incidentes previos, como el apuñalamiento de un joven de 20 años el pasado agosto.

La empresa, que ya ha consolidado su infraestructura de centros de datos y utiliza servicios como Google Workspace, planea migrar sistemas esenciales como ERP, CRM y gestión del ciclo de vida de productos, incluyendo los diseños de aviones. La vicepresidenta ejecutiva de digitalización de Airbus, Catherine Jestin, destacó la importancia de mantener estos datos bajo control europeo debido a su sensibilidad.

En el caso de Colmenar Viejo, una mujer de 30 años tuvo un parto programado en su casa, pero surgieron complicaciones que llevaron a la muerte del bebé tras intentos de reanimación fallidos. El otro caso ocurrió en Ciudad Lineal, donde un parto complicado por la posición de nalgas también terminó con la muerte del bebé. Ambos casos subrayan los riesgos inherentes a los partos en casa, incluso en circunstancias aparentemente controladas. Las autoridades sanitarias destacan que, aunque los partos en casa pueden ser seguros en algunos casos, siempre deben contar con la presencia de profesionales cualificados, una planificación adecuada y la posibilidad de una rápida intervención médica en caso de emergencia. Esta práctica ha ganado cierta popularidad, pero los expertos insisten en que siempre debe evaluarse el riesgo antes de optar por un parto domiciliario.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-sobre-la-muerte-de-dos-bebes-tras-partos-en-casa-en-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-sobre-la-muerte-de-dos-bebes-tras-partos-en-casa-en-madrid</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 08:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malas lenguas analiza la actualidad política y social: Extremadura, acoso, sanidad y crisis institucional]]></title><description><![CDATA[El programa 226 de Malas lenguas, emitido en RTVE Play y dirigido por Jesús Cintora junto a su equipo, ofrece un repaso amplio y crítico a varios de los principales asuntos de actualidad política y social en España a finales de 2025. Uno de los ejes centrales del programa es la polémica surgida en torno a las elecciones en Extremadura, donde se analizan denuncias y reacciones relacionadas con irregularidades, incluida la controversia sobre un presunto robo de votos. El espacio pone el foco en las implicaciones democráticas de estos hechos y en la necesidad de transparencia institucional.

Otro bloque destacado aborda el caso de acoso a un menor que salpica al exjefe de Redes del partido Vox. El programa contextualiza la denuncia, examina la respuesta política y mediática, y reflexiona sobre la responsabilidad de los partidos y de sus dirigentes ante comportamientos graves que afectan a menores.

Bernardo Quintero, entonces estudiante, fue retado por su profesor a limpiarlo, un desafío que marcaría el inicio de su carrera en ciberseguridad y que años después le permitiría fundar VirusTotal. Recientemente, Quintero revisó el código original y descubrió detalles que le habían pasado desapercibidos a los 18 años, incluyendo un mensaje oculto contra ETA y una firma del autor: los bytes 'KI'. Tras una investigación que involucró la comunidad, antiguos alumnos y análisis de variantes del virus, logró identificar al creador: Antonio Enrique 'Kike' Astorga, fallecido años atrás, cuyo legado como pionero en ciberseguridad en Málaga queda reconocido.

Según la organización, los consumidores están pagando un 27% más por unos huevos que ya no tienen el valor añadido de ser de gallinas con acceso al aire libre. Además, la OCU destaca que no se está informando correctamente sobre este cambio en el etiquetado, lo que podría inducir a error a los compradores.

Lo controvertido de la medida es que, por primera vez, solo los restaurantes cántabros con tres estrellas Michelin podrán optar a realizar este evento, lo que ha dejado fuera a muchos establecimientos de la región que no cumplen con esta condición. Esta decisión ha sido tachada por el PSOE de elitista y discriminatoria, argumentando que limita las oportunidades para muchos buenos cocineros cántabros que, aunque no tengan tres estrellas Michelin, son igualmente capaces de ofrecer un servicio de calidad. La medida ha sido criticada por la falta de igualdad de oportunidades y por favorecer solo a un único restaurante, El Cenador de Amós, propiedad de Jesús Sánchez, el único en Cantabria con tres estrellas Michelin.

Además, se han producido avances en el acceso al agua potable, la reapertura de algunos centros de salud y la respuesta a las recientes tormentas invernales mediante la entrega de tiendas de campaña, mantas y ropa. A pesar de estos progresos, Guterres subrayó que la situación sigue siendo muy frágil debido a la destrucción de infraestructuras, la escasez de suministros y las restricciones de entrada de materiales.

Aunque ha alcanzado grandes cotas de popularidad, especialmente en el sur de Estados Unidos, en los últimos años ha experimentado caídas significativas en su audiencia. Un cambio importante llegó con la intervención de Michael Jordan, quien, a pesar de los riesgos financieros, compró un equipo de NASCAR y se enfrentó a la estructura monopolística de la liga. Su lucha legal obligó a los responsables de NASCAR a modificar su modelo de negocio, asegurando que las licencias de los equipos sean permanentes y no se renegocien cada ciertos años. Este cambio representa una revolución en la forma en que opera NASCAR, haciendo que las franquicias sean más rentables y brindando a los equipos mayor influencia en las decisiones de la competición. A pesar de los cambios, la popularidad de NASCAR sigue siendo incierta, y muchos se pregunt]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/michael-jordan-reforma-nascar-licencias-permanentes-y-mayor-poder-para-los-equipos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/michael-jordan-reforma-nascar-licencias-permanentes-y-mayor-poder-para-los-equipos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La exconcejala del PP denuncia la falta de apoyo ante el machismo del alcalde de Navalmoral y su salida del partido]]></title><description><![CDATA[Paula González, exconcejala del Partido Popular en Navalmoral de la Mata (Cáceres), ha denunciado públicamente el 'trato machista' y los 'abusos de poder' por parte del alcalde, Enrique Hueso. Tras haber expresado su malestar desde principios de año y solicitar amparo al partido, la exedil ha decidido abandonar el PP al no obtener ninguna respuesta. A pesar de las preocupaciones expresadas por los miembros del partido, como el portavoz regional José Ángel Sánchez Juliá, el PP no adoptó medidas concretas para abordar la situación. González, en su carta, destaca que su decisión no fue impulsiva, sino el resultado de un desgaste emocional y personal.

La normativa interna establece un máximo de ocho años en cargos públicos, con una extensión excepcional a 12 años, y en el caso de Montero, que lleva en el Consejo Ciudadano desde 2014, se encuentra a punto de superar dicho límite. Esto la obligaría a solicitar una prórroga a la militancia para continuar en su puesto. Ione Belarra, que también lleva años en la dirección, podría enfrentarse a la misma situación, al igual que otros dirigentes como Pablo Fernández, Javier Sánchez Serna o Noemí Santana. El problema surge porque la limitación de mandatos, originalmente impulsada por el movimiento 15-M, se ha convertido en un desafío para renovar los cargos en un partido que se presentaba como una alternativa al sistema político tradicional.

Se señala que la inactividad física ya es una “pandemia silenciosa” y que caminar o ir en bicicleta constituye la forma más eficiente de integrar ejercicio en la rutina diaria de los jóvenes. Diversos estudios citados sugieren que el uso del patinete reduce el gasto energético comparado con caminar y puede desplazar la movilidad activa hacia trayectos cortos, lo que podría disminuir la actividad física diaria y la interacción social asociada al transporte activo. Además, se destaca un incremento en lesiones graves entre usuarios jóvenes, supported por datos de la DGT que muestran aumentos significativos en hospitalizaciones y fallecimientos por accidentes con vehículos de movilidad personal.

En todos estos escenarios, se anticipaba una espiral de caos, violencia y conflicto prolongado en Venezuela, incluyendo enfrentamientos internos, un éxodo masivo de refugiados y la posibilidad de intervención extranjera. Los expertos alertaron de que un cambio de poder abrupto podría llevar a la nación a una guerra civil o a un vacío de poder que favorezca a actores armados rivales. Aunque algunos políticos opositores, como María Corina Machado, defienden que la caída de Maduro no necesariamente conduciría a una guerra civil, muchos analistas advierten sobre los riesgos y las secuelas devastadoras de una transición violenta.

Los magistrados destacan que el hecho de que la asesora fuera una amiga íntima de Gómez y no una funcionaria especializada en protocolo podría constituir un indicio de malversación. El tribunal subraya que la investigación está en su fase preliminar, pero que ya existen pruebas suficientes para continuar con la causa. En su resolución, los jueces sugieren que las actividades de Álvarez podrían ser excesivas y más propias de una amiga que de una profesional encargada de los asuntos protocolarios.

Ante la saturación en los hospitales de la ciudad, muchos pacientes optan por desplazarse a centros comarcales como Requena, Llíria, Alzira o Sagunt, donde, según testimonios, las listas de espera de atención primaria son largas y la atención en Urgencias es percibida como más rápida. El fenómeno, descrito por trabajadores sanitarios, se considera un desplazamiento sanitario derivado de la saturación de los grandes hospitales.

Sin embargo, la crónica señala varias inconsistencias: De los Santos tenía 17 años en la fecha de las elecciones del 3 de marzo de 1996 y no habría podido votar, ya que no alcanzaba la mayoría de edad hasta agosto de ese año. Además, la promesa de acabar con la mili no figuraba en el programa electoral del PP para 1996. El texto detalla que la eliminación de la mili se gestó posteriormente, en el marco del pacto del Majestic con CiU y, finalmente, con la Ley 17/1999 y el Real Decreto 247/2001 bajo el Gobierno de Aznar. Se describe también que la imagen pública de Aznar y el PP sobre este tema se hizo suya años más tarde, pese a no figurar en el programa original de 1996.

A partir del Diario de Merer (Papyrus Jarf) descubierto en Wadi al-Jarf, se reconstruye una imagen detallada de las operaciones portuarias y de transporte: la carga de bloques de caliza de Tura en imus (barcazas) y su traslado a través de un canal hacia el dique Ro-She Khufu, la escala de la flotilla y las rutas de viaje que conectaban el Nilo con el yacimiento de Giza. También se describen las innovaciones hidráulicas y mecánicas empleadas, como las compuertas para elevar embarcaciones durante las crecidas y las rampas de Hatnub utilizadas para mover cargas pesadas. El artículo contextualiza la magnitud de la operación, con estimaciones de cientos o miles de viajes y la existencia de un complejo urbano-administrativo junto al puerto.

Según FACUA, el restaurante ganaba más dinero con las cancelaciones que con los propios clientes que acudían a cenar. La medida, que ha generado una gran polémica, pone de manifiesto la práctica de algunos restaurantes de imponer penalizaciones desproporcionadas, afectando directamente a los derechos de los consumidores. Esta sanción es un recordatorio de la importancia de respetar las normativas de protección al consumidor y de la lucha constante contra prácticas abusivas en el sector.

La UE buscará garantizar que Ucrania disponga de los recursos necesarios para afrontar su recuperación y resistencia frente a Rusia. A pesar de la reticencia inicial de algunos países como Bélgica, la mayoría de los líderes optaron por recurrir a los mercados de capitales para este préstamo, con la promesa de que Ucrania solo tendría que devolverlo una vez Rusia pague las reparaciones por la invasión.

Esta medida fue impugnada por una asociación de consumidores alemana, que alegó que modificar unilateralmente las condiciones del contrato es ilegal. La Audiencia Territorial de Múnich concluyó que la ausencia de anuncios era un factor determinante para que los usuarios decidieran suscribirse, y que la notificación de Amazon podía inducir a error sobre su derecho a imponer publicidad.

El trabajo utiliza un enfoque de electrodo diluido para aislar las partículas activas de carbono duro y medir con precisión la velocidad de inserción de sodio frente a litio. Los resultados indican que la sodación es intrínsecamente más rápida en ese material, con coeficientes de difusión aparentes mayores para el sodio. Además, el paso limitante durante la carga es el llenado de los poros del carbono duro, lo que se asocia con una menor energía de activación para el sodio frente al litio. Este hallazgo implica que, en condiciones de alta potencia, las baterías de sodio-ion podrían no solo ser una opción más barata, sino también más rápidas de recargar y menos sensibles a variaciones de temperatura, lo que podría favorecer su escalad]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/baterias-de-sodio-ion-podrian-cargar-mas-rapido-y-resistir-mejor-la-temperatura-que-las-de-litio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/baterias-de-sodio-ion-podrian-cargar-mas-rapido-y-resistir-mejor-la-temperatura-que-las-de-litio</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un vecino de Bargas voltea un coche con su tractor tras un conflicto por el acceso a su garaje]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Bargas, Toledo, un vecino volcó un coche con su tractor tras un enfrentamiento por el obstruccionamiento de su entrada de garaje.

Durante los años 80, los cuadernos llegaron a estar en más de 6.000 quioscos y se vendieron hasta 10 millones de unidades anualmente.

Este es el tercer ajuste de costes desde el inicio del proyecto y supone un incremento del 8% respecto a la última revisión de 2023. La compañía atribuye esta subida a los riesgos asociados a la magnitud del proyecto, que se espera comience a producir electricidad en 2038. La decisión de EDF se produce en un contexto de precios eléctricos bajos, demanda inestable y una elevada deuda de la empresa, estimada en 50.000 millones de euros. El proyecto requiere apoyo estatal en forma de préstamos garantizados y será evaluado por la Comisión Europea en 2026 para determinar su viabilidad. Esta iniciativa forma parte de la apuesta de Emmanuel Macron por la energía nuclear, que busca extender la vida de las centrales actuales de 40 a 60 añ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/edf-revisa-al-alza-el-coste-de-seis-reactores-nucleares-a-72-800-millones-de-euros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/edf-revisa-al-alza-el-coste-de-seis-reactores-nucleares-a-72-800-millones-de-euros</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Nobel de Física 2025 premia la observación del efecto túnel cuántico a escala macroscópica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Premio Nobel de Física 2025 ha recaído en John Clarke (Universidad de California, Berkeley), Michel H. Devoret (Universidad de Yale y de California Santa Barbara) y John M. Martinis (Universidad de California Santa Barbara y QoLab) por haber demostrado el efecto túnel cuántico a una escala macroscópica y por la observación de la cuantización de la energía en un circuito eléctrico. Estos científicos lograron lo que antes parecía imposible: observar un fenómeno característico del mundo subatómico en un sistema formado por miles de millones de partículas. Su trabajo se basó en innovar con un tipo especial de circuito superconductor, conocido como unión de Josephson, que les permitió comprobar cómo un sistema entero podía “atravesar” una barrera de energía por efecto túnel, algo que hasta entonces solo se había visto en partículas individuales. Además, confirmaron que este sistema absorbía y emitía energía en cantidades discretas, tal como predice la mecánica cuántica.

Paralelamente, se evidencia la profunda fractura entre Vox y Revuelta, la plataforma juvenil vinculada al partido, que pasa de una colaboración aparentemente cohesionada a una disputa abierta por temas de finanzas, auditorías y control de la información.

Este fenómeno se ha visto especialmente reflejado en la población joven, con tasas más altas entre los adultos jóvenes de 20 a 29 años, y las mujeres adolescentes, para quienes el suicidio representa la principal causa de muerte. La crisis está impulsada por factores económicos, como la inestabilidad financiera, la precariedad laboral, la pobreza y la creciente presión social. Además, la promoción de valores materialistas y la influencia de las redes sociales contribuyen a un sentimiento de desesperanza. Los expertos destacan la insuficiente oferta de servicios de salud mental y la falta de atención a la Ley 26.657 de Salud Mental como factores que agravan la situación.

Los resultados mostraron que los niños que recibían educación religiosa eran más propensos a aceptar como reales los relatos que incluían elementos sobrenaturales o milagros, mientras que los niños sin esa formación religiosa distinguían claramente entre hechos reales y ficción.

Esta votación, aunque no prevista por el reglamento vigente, refleja el malestar interno por los cambios recientes en la cúpula directiva, impulsados por una nueva ley impulsada por el PP y Vox que reconfiguró la gestión de la cadena valenciana. Varios movimientos y nombramientos previos son citados como contexto: la sustitución del anterior director de informativos Iván Esteve, la llegada de Josep Magraner y, posteriormente, de Francisco Aura como director general.

Critica la negociación entre PSOE y PP para el reparto de vocales del Consejo General del Poder Judicial y sostiene que ese movimiento benefició a la derecha, afectando la percepción de independencia del poder judicial.

La consejera de Sanidad, Fátima Matute, ha desmentido las acusaciones, señalando que no existen 'pruebas sólidas' que respalden dichas denuncias. A pesar de los testimonios de pacientes y trabajadores, y de las informaciones de laSexta que documentan la falta de personal y el uso de material reutilizado, el Gobierno regional asegura que no se ha recortado personal ni se ha reutilizado material. Ayuso ha tildado las críticas de 'chismes' y ha afirmado que las denuncias responden a un plan orquestado desde Moncloa para desestabilizar el sistema sanitario madrileño.

Se subraya la transformación del concepto de MAD de un thriller serio a una comedia negra, lo que resalta la visión de Kubrick sobre la absurdidad de la destrucción mutua asegurada. Entre los elementos visuales más recordados se encuentran el War Room, diseñado por Ken Adam, con un bunker triangular que se convirtió en un símbolo icónico del cine de Kubrick.

La exconcejal Paula González Morato había presentado quejas internas sobre el trato machista y el abuso de poder del alcalde, pero el partido tardó meses en reaccionar. El audio revela que la cúpula del PP ya estaba al tanto de la gravedad de la situación y temía que las denuncias afectaran su imagen política, especialmente en un momento cercano a las elecciones en Extremadura. La dimisión de González Morato en diciembre, tras no recibir respuesta a sus denuncias, ha puesto al PP en una situación incómoda, dado que la presidenta del partido en Extremadura, María Guardiola, se ha mostrado públicamente contra cualquier tipo de machismo.

Según Compromís, estos aumentos superan con frecuencia el 10% de la cápita acordada, mientras que la prórroga de Elx contemplaba solo un 1,5% de subida. La Consejería de Sanidad defendió que se trató de un ajuste matemático establecido por el contrato y las resoluciones técnicas, no de una negociación. El asunto ha estado rodeado de polémica por audios que supuestamente demostrarían prácticas para favorecer a la empresa, así como por exdirectivos y cambios de liderazgo en Ribera Salud.

Sin embargo, la versión final que llegó a los móviles de los valencianos solo pedía evitar los desplazamientos, sin hacer mención explícita al confinamiento. Este cambio de enfoque en el mensaje se debe a las dudas legales sobre las competencias del gobierno autonómico para ordenar el confinamiento, lo que retrasó su emisión.

El alto tribunal considera que las publicaciones del medio digital y la intervención de Inda no se basaron en datos verificados procedentes de fuentes objetivas y fiables, lo que desvirtúa la veracidad de las afirmaciones sobre un supuesto pago de 272.325 euros del Gobierno de Venezuela a Iglesias a través de una cuenta en Islas Granadinas. Aunque Okdiario afirmó haber tenido acceso a una orden de pago, la sentencia señala que la información estaba basada en indicios y documentación no verificada; además, señala que la fuente principal, Eugenio Pino, afirmó que la investigación era embrionaria y que los documentos eran fotocopias, lo que dificultaba su autenticidad.

En su publicación, detalla que, para alquilar un piso de 1.000 euros al mes, los propietarios piden requisitos como tres nóminas, movimientos bancarios de tres meses, fondos disponibles y un contrato de trabajo fijo, además de un avalista. Lucas asegura que este proceso es una experiencia deshumanizadora que dificulta enormemente la búsqueda de vivienda, no solo para pisos completos, sino también para alquilar habitaciones. La situación se ha agravado con precios cada vez más altos, lo que genera un sentimiento generalizado de frustración entre los jóvenes que intentan acceder al mercado del alquiler. Aunque Lucas subraya que su experiencia se limita a Madrid, este tipo de exigencias parece extenderse por todo el mercado inmobiliario español.

El evento contó con la actuación del rapero alemán Kool Savas, quien, en un intento de animar al público, condujo un Tesla Cybertruck al escenario. Sin embargo, el ambiente fue incómodo, ya que los empleados no respondieron a los cánticos que el rapero intentó iniciar, y la performance fue descrita como 'incómoda' por testigos. Además, el evento estuvo marcado por un discurso del director de la planta, André Thierig, que aprovechó para criticar al sindicato IG Metall, afirmando que los empleados solo recibirían un aumento salarial del 2% si el sindicato tuviera poder de negociación. A pesar de un aumento salarial del 4%, IG Metall considera que este incremento no es suficiente en comparación con los estándares de la industria automotriz en Alemania.

La Comisión Europea presentó dos alternativas para financiar este esfuerzo, pero la propuesta de utilizar los activos rusos ha generado resistencia en algunos países, como Bélgica y Hungría, debido a las implicaciones legales y políticas.

Según el informe FOESSA de 2024, Càritas alerta de la alta precariedad social en esta región, especialmente para los jóvenes y los inmigrantes, quienes experimentan tasas de pobreza mucho mayores que la media. Aunque ha disminuido la pobreza extrema, el coste elevado de la vivienda sigue empujando a muchos a una situación de vulnerabilidad. El informe también señala que un 15% de los hogares enfrentan pobreza severa tras pagar el alquiler. Esta situación ha impulsado una alta demanda de habitaciones compartidas, lo que ha incrementado también el precio del alquiler.

La Junta Electoral Provincial de Badajoz ya ha confirmado que los 124 electores afectados por el robo podrán votar de nuevo sin que exista alteración en el resultado electoral. El robo, ocurrido en la madrugada del jueves, afectó a una caja fuerte que contenía votos emitidos, pero la investigación apunta a que se trató de un robo común, no con motivaciones políticas.

Adaptación de la novela de Anthony Burgess, la película aborda temas como la ultraviolencia juvenil, el control social y el libre albedrío de una manera única y provocadora. El uso de la violencia estilizada y un humor macabro, sumado a la inquietante música de Beethoven, hace que la obra siga generando un impacto emocional fuerte incluso medio siglo después de su estreno. Su visión de un joven delincuente sometido a un método de 'curación' que le elimina la capacidad de decidir entre el bien y el mal toca el corazón de una crítica más profunda sobre la sociedad y el control institucional. Además, la película sigue siendo relevante no solo por lo que muestra, sino por la manera en la que obliga al espectador a reflexionar sobre su propio papel frente a la barbarie que se justifica en nombre del orden.

La madre ocultó el cuerpo de la niña en un armario, envuelto en toallas y dentro de una bolsa de plástico. Los médicos confirmaron que la bebé falleció a causa de un corte en el cuello. La acusada confesó el crimen para evitar que se descubriera el embarazo, aunque no presentó ninguna alteración psíquica en el momento de cometer el asesinato.

Sin embargo, estas donaciones familiares están gravadas por el impuesto de donaciones, lo que hace que el hijo receptor deba pagar impuestos y que el padre deba declarar el incremento patrimonial en su renta. En contraste, las donaciones a entidades sin ánimo de lucro, como ONGs, reciben importantes bonificaciones fiscales. Esta disparidad genera una paradoja: apoyar a hijos directamente resulta más gravoso fiscalmente que contribuir a causas solidarias. José Alberto Marín, decano del Colegio Notarial de Catalunya, explica que cada comunidad autónoma aplica esta fiscalidad de manera distinta, siendo Catalunya especialmente estricta.

En España, más de 55.000 personas conviven con esta enfermedad, un 15% más que hace 15 años, según la Sociedad Española de Neurología (SEN). Este aumento se atribuye tanto a mejoras en el diagnóstico precoz y tratamientos más eficaces, como a posibles cambios en los hábitos de vida. La EM tiene un impacto directo en la vida laboral, social, familiar y emocional de quienes la padecen, siendo una de las principales causas de discapacidad neurológica en adultos jóvenes. Además, supone un coste económico importante para las familias, con un gasto anual medio de 7.000 euros en fases iniciales, que puede superar los 18.000 euros en etapas avanzadas. El 44% de los casos depende de cuidadores familiares, quienes también sufren estrés y ansiedad. La enfermedad provoca que el 83% de los pacientes abandone prematuramente su empleo, principalmente por]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-esclerosis-multiple-incrementa-su-incidencia-en-espana-y-genera-un-alto-impacto-socioeconomico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-esclerosis-multiple-incrementa-su-incidencia-en-espana-y-genera-un-alto-impacto-socioeconomico</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[WeLion avanza hacia baterías de estado sólido con 824 Wh/kg en laboratorio]]></title><description><![CDATA[WeLion, un fabricante chino de baterías de estado sólido, ha logrado un hito importante en sus investigaciones al alcanzar una densidad energética de 824 Wh/kg en pruebas de laboratorio. Aunque este valor representa un récord para la empresa, la tecnología aún no está lista para producción comercial. El objetivo a largo plazo de WeLion es superar los 1.000 Wh/kg, una cifra que, de lograrse, situaría a la compañía entre las más avanzadas en una de las áreas más críticas de la industria automotriz y de dispositivos móviles. Comparativamente, las baterías de litio-ferrofosfato (LFP) convencionales mantienen densidades de alrededor de 150-180 Wh/kg, mientras que otros desarrolladores de baterías de estado sólido apuntan a 350-500 Wh/kg. WeLion afirma que la densidad superior a 800 Wh/kg es una excepción en el panorama actual y no ha explicado el marco técnico preciso para mantener esa ventaja frente a competidores.

Casanova afirma que toma la decisión de revelar su condición con la intención de combatir el estigma que rodea al VIH y servir de ejemplo para otras personas que viven con la infección. Según sus palabras, este paso lo realiza con dignidad y con el objetivo de que más gente se sienta capaz de salir del armario y buscar información y tratamiento sin miedo. El cineasta subraya que la mayoría de las personas con VIH no comparten su situación por el estigma social, lo que agrava el rechazo.

El hombre presentó fuertes dolores en el antepié derecho y fue trasladado en ambulancia al hospital, donde permaneció siete horas en Urgencias esperando ser atendido. Inicialmente, el personal médico lo clasificó como emergencia baja y, tras recibir un diagnóstico preliminar de trombosis venosa profunda, fue enviado a casa. La ecografía Doppler, que habría permitido un diagnóstico correcto de aneurisma de la arteria poplítea, no se realizó porque el servicio de ecografía no estaba disponible por las tardes.

Este retraso se consideró excesivo e inaceptable y se calificó como una disfunción del sistema público de salud, afectando la oportunidad de diagnóstico y, en consecuencia, de posibles tratamientos. Aunque el diagnóstico definitivo de cáncer de páncreas llegó tras acudir a un centro privado, el TSJM aplicó la doctrina de la pérdida de oportunidad para indemnizar a la familia, concluyendo que la demora privó a la paciente de una oportunidad razonable de tratamiento en una etapa más favorable de la enfermedad.

Este proceso ha destruido gran parte de los antiguos qanats, sistemas de túneles milenarios diseñados para extraer agua subterránea de forma sostenible. La combinación de sequías extremas, cambio climático y políticas hidráulicas erróneas ha reducido drásticamente los niveles de agua en ríos, lagos y humedales, provocando la desertificación de regiones clave. La agricultura consume aproximadamente el 90% del agua disponible, mientras que la sobreexplotación de pozos ha vaciado los acuíferos y disminuido la eficiencia de los sistemas tradicionales de captación.

Esta medida se produce como respuesta al bloqueo marítimo anunciado por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, que amenaza con incautar cualquier embarcación sancionada que comercie con Venezuela. Los primeros barcos escoltados transportan derivados del petróleo y subproductos de la refinación procedentes del puerto de José, en el Estado Anzoátegui, y no están incluidos en la lista de sancionados por Washington. La tensión se ha intensificado tras la operación militar estadounidense contra un petrolero venezolano sancionado hace una semana, lo que provocó una protesta en Caracas. Mientras tanto, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) mantiene el envío de crudo nacional, a pesar de las dificultades derivadas de sanciones impuestas desde 2019, que afectaron gravemente a la producc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-despliega-la-armada-para-proteger-sus-buques-petroleros-ante-el-bloqueo-estadounidense</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-despliega-la-armada-para-proteger-sus-buques-petroleros-ante-el-bloqueo-estadounidense</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La ONU advierte de un aumento sin precedentes de asentamientos israelíes en Cisjordania durante 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Organización de las Naciones Unidas ha advertido de que Israel ha acelerado de forma significativa la construcción de asentamientos en los territorios palestinos ocupados, alcanzando en 2025 el mayor número de nuevas colonias desde 2017. Según recordó el coordinador especial adjunto de la ONU para el Proceso de Paz en Oriente Medio, Ramiz Alakbarov, estas colonias son ilegales conforme al derecho internacional y su expansión socava la viabilidad de la solución de dos Estados.

Alakbarov presentó su informe trimestral ante el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, en el que evaluó el cumplimiento de la resolución 2334, que exige a Israel el cese de toda actividad de colonización en territorio palestino. El representante de la ONU alertó de que la tendencia actual amenaza la estabilidad regional y agrava un conflicto ya profundamente enquistado.

Se baraja la opción de ampliar la capacidad submarina nacional más allá de las cuatro unidades actuales (S-81 Isaac Peral, S-82 Narciso Monturiol, S-83 Cosme García y S-84 Mateo García de los Reyes) y de reforzar la soberanía tecnológica al nacionalizar sistemas clave como la pila de combustible, los periscopios y el sistema de combate. El artículo evalúa beneficios operativos y estratégicos, incluyendo la continuidad industrial para Navantia Cartagena y la reducción de dependencia tecnológica.

Sin embargo, datos oficiales indican que entre 2019 y 2025 Madrid ha recibido 129.000 millones de euros, es decir, 43.000 millones más que durante el Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy, constituyendo la mayor financiación que ha recibido una comunidad autónoma en la historia de España. Para 2026, se prevén además 23.135 millones del Sistema de Financiación y 1.350 millones en transferencias directas. Desde el PSOE en Madrid, Óscar López ha criticado que, pese a esta financiación récord, Ayuso prioriza transferir fondos a grupos privados en lugar de reforzar la sanidad y las universidades públicas.

La Policía Local la identificó apenas dos horas después gracias a documentos personales encontrados en la bolsa donde estaban los animales. La intervención fue inmediata tras la llamada de un vecino que escuchó maullidos provenientes del contenedor. Los cachorros fueron rescatados por el refugio multiespecie La Isla de Tali, que se encargó de proporcionarles cuidados y protegerlos junto a su madre, atrapada mediante jaula en la finca de la denunciada. El Concello de Nigrán abrió un expediente sancionador bajo la Ley de Bienestar Animal de 2023, que establece multas de entre 500 y 10.000 euros para casos de maltrato animal.

El contrato, valorado en 195 millones de euros para dos años, ha generado críticas de la Asociación Galega para a Defensa da Sanidade Pública (AGDSP), que denuncia que se priorizan los beneficios privados sobre la cobertura y calidad de la atención sanitaria. Povisa ha recibido pagos por actividad y por habitante, incluso con una reducción de pacientes atendidos y la eliminación de servicios clave como neurocirugía, electrofisiología y atención a grandes quemados, que ahora se derivan al Hospital Universitario de A Coruña.

Smith indicó que además se han reunido evidencias de que Trump incumplió la ley al almacenar documentos clasificados de su primer mandato en su residencia de Mar-a-Lago, en Florida, y al obstruir los esfuerzos del gobierno para recuperarlos. Durante la entrevista a puerta cerrada, Smith subrayó que sus decisiones en la investigación no se vieron influenciadas por consideraciones políticas, creencias personales ni la candidatura de Trump en las elecciones de 2024.

Asimismo, Wiles criticó a la fiscal general Pam Bondi por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein, cuestionando la distribución de información incompleta a influenciadores conservadores.

Assange argumenta que Machado ha incitado públicamente a la Administración estadounidense a intervenir militarmente en Venezuela, e incluso a justificar ataques contra barcos civiles frente a sus costas, lo que, a su juicio, la hace inelegible para recibir un galardón destinado a promover la fraternidad entre naciones, conforme al testamento de Alfred Nobel.

El portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores chino, Guo Jiakun, afirmó que Pekín se opone a cualquier forma de intimidación unilateral y defiende el derecho de los Estados a salvaguardar su soberanía y dignidad nacional. En este sentido, subrayó que Venezuela tiene pleno derecho a desarrollar de manera independiente relaciones de cooperación económica con otros países, siempre que estas sean mutuamente beneficiosas.

Según el Ministerio Público, aunque considera creíble el testimonio de la denunciante, no existen pruebas suficientes que acrediten que Errejón actuase sabiendo que ella no consentía la relación. En su escrito, la Fiscalía explica que, cuando Mouliaá expresó de forma explícita su negativa, Errejón detuvo su comportamiento, lo que a su juicio demuestra la falta de dolo necesario para sostener la acusación. 

El juez instructor, Adolfo Carretero, había propuesto previamente juzgar a Errejón, al entender que había indicios de un antiguo delito de abuso sexual —figura que existía antes de la reforma de la ley del 'solo sí es sí'—, al no mediar violencia ni intimidación. Los hechos denunciados se remontan a octubre de 2021. La actriz sostiene que sufrió tocamientos y besos no consentidos en varios momentos durante una misma]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-solicita-archivar-la-causa-contra-inigo-errejon-por-falta-de-pruebas-en-la-denuncia-de-elisa-mouliaa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-solicita-archivar-la-causa-contra-inigo-errejon-por-falta-de-pruebas-en-la-denuncia-de-elisa-mouliaa</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo y Polestar se oponen a retrasar el fin de los coches de combustión tras 2035]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Unión Europea se encuentra en una encrucijada clave ante el posible retraso de la prohibición de vender vehículos nuevos de combustión interna a partir de 2035. Aunque varios fabricantes y países, entre ellos Alemania, presionan para permitir excepciones mediante el uso de e-combustibles sintéticos, otras marcas como Volvo y Polestar defienden mantener la fecha sin cambios. Ambas compañías sostienen que alterar el calendario supondría un grave retroceso para la transición energética europea y un golpe a la confianza del consumidor. Thomas Ingenlath, CEO de Polestar, insistió en que la estabilidad regulatoria es esencial para garantizar las inversiones ya realizadas en electrificación. Tanto Volvo como Polestar han invertido miles de millones en desarrollar plataformas y cadenas de suministro totalmente eléctricas. Polestar ya fabrica únicamente vehículos eléctricos, mientras que Volvo prevé ser una marca 100 % eléctrica en 2030, cinco años antes del plazo fijado por la UE.

El artículo subraya que las palabras de Abascal se enmarcan en su discurso político habitual, que recurre con frecuencia a un tono provocador y a referencias culturales y simbólicas para conectar con su base electoral y marcar distancias con otros actores políticos y sociales.[file:1][we]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/polemica-por-la-broma-de-abascal-sobre-desinfectar-el-palacio-de-congresos-de-plasencia-tras-un-homenaje-a-robe-iniesta</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/polemica-por-la-broma-de-abascal-sobre-desinfectar-el-palacio-de-congresos-de-plasencia-tras-un-homenaje-a-robe-iniesta</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 13:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las fuertes lluvias provocan inundaciones en varios tramos de la Pista de Silla a su paso por Massanassa, Alfafar y Catarroja]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las intensas lluvias registradas en la comarca de l’Horta Sud durante las últimas horas han causado importantes acumulaciones de agua en la conocida Pista de Silla, especialmente en los tramos comprendidos entre los municipios de Massanassa, Alfafar y Catarroja. La magnitud de las precipitaciones ha provocado el colapso parcial del sistema de alcantarillado, que se ha visto incapaz de absorber el gran volumen de agua en tan poco tiempo, lo que ha derivado en anegamientos de la calzada y problemas de tráfico en la zona. Muchas de las vías adyacentes también se han visto afectadas, dificultando la circulación y generando retenciones en las horas punta. Según testigos y vecinos de la zona, el agua ha alcanzado niveles que superan el bordillo en algunos puntos, lo que ha obligado a varios conductores a detener sus vehículos o buscar rutas alternativas. Los servicios de emergencia han intervenido durante toda la mañana para balizar los tramos más afectados y garantizar la seguridad de los c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-fuertes-lluvias-provocan-inundaciones-en-varios-tramos-de-la-pista-de-silla-a-su-paso-por-massanassa-alfafar-y-catarroja</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-fuertes-lluvias-provocan-inundaciones-en-varios-tramos-de-la-pista-de-silla-a-su-paso-por-massanassa-alfafar-y-catarroja</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 12:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Santas Pascuas defiende su cartel como creación artística y rechaza retirarlo tras la denuncia de Abogados Cristianos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La organización del Festival Santas Pascuas, que celebra su décima edición hasta el 5 de enero de 2026 en Pamplona, ha respondido formalmente al requerimiento enviado por la Fundación Española de Abogados Cristianos. Esta entidad, de orientación ultraconservadora, había solicitado la retirada del cartel promocional de la edición de este año por considerar que constituía una ofensa a los sentimientos religiosos al recrear una escena inspirada en la Última Cena con una estética contemporánea. Según la fundación, la representación resultaba «grosera e insultante» por el uso de elementos modernos como gafas de sol en figuras identificables con la Virgen María y otros personajes religiosos.

En su respuesta, Santas Pascuas defiende el cartel como una reinterpretación artística libre y contextualizada dentro de la escenografía musical actual. Explica que los personajes retratados son artistas y músicos navarros participantes en el propio festival, y que la imagen no pretende ridiculizar ni d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/santas-pascuas-defiende-su-cartel-como-creacion-artistica-y-rechaza-retirarlo-tras-la-denuncia-de-abogados-cristianos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/santas-pascuas-defiende-su-cartel-como-creacion-artistica-y-rechaza-retirarlo-tras-la-denuncia-de-abogados-cristianos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El mayor campo solar de China reverdece un desierto... por accidente]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo explica cómo la instalación masiva de paneles solares en un desierto chino ha alterado el microclima local, reteniendo humedad, reduciendo la erosión y permitiendo el crecimiento de vegetación de forma no planificada.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mayor-campo-solar-de-china-reverdece-un-desierto-por-accidente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mayor-campo-solar-de-china-reverdece-un-desierto-por-accidente</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 23:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las políticas económicas del Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy y su impacto en España (2011-2018)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante el mandato de Mariano Rajoy como presidente del Gobierno español (2011-2018), se aplicaron una serie de medidas económicas centradas en la austeridad y el control del déficit público, tras la fuerte recesión ocasionada por la crisis financiera de 2008. Su Ejecutivo impulsó reformas que transformaron profundamente el mercado laboral y el sistema fiscal, al tiempo que recortaba el gasto en servicios públicos. Entre las actuaciones más relevantes se incluyen la subida del IVA en 2012 del 18% al 21%, la reducción de la indemnización por despido, y una reforma laboral que generó un notable aumento del empleo temporal y precario. En el ámbito social, las pensiones solo se incrementaron un 0,25% anual durante varios años, lo que supuso una pérdida del poder adquisitivo de los jubilados. Además, se redujeron las prestaciones por desempleo y se introdujeron copagos farmacéuticos y recortes en educación y sanidad. El Gobierno también autorizó un rescate bancario por valor de 63.000 millo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-politicas-economicas-del-gobierno-de-mariano-rajoy-y-su-impacto-en-espana-2011-2018</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-politicas-economicas-del-gobierno-de-mariano-rajoy-y-su-impacto-en-espana-2011-2018</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 21:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Estados Unidos impone un bloqueo naval a petroleros sancionados por comerciar con Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente estadounidense Donald Trump ha ordenado el bloqueo total de los petroleros sancionados que entren o salgan de Venezuela, en una nueva escalada de tensión con el Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro. En un mensaje en su red social, Trump declaró que el despliegue militar en el Caribe se mantendrá hasta que el chavismo devuelva a Estados Unidos 'el petróleo, las tierras y demás activos robados'. Además, el mandatario anunció que el régimen venezolano ha sido catalogado como 'organización terrorista extranjera', alegando su implicación en delitos como narcotráfico y trata de personas. Actualmente, unos 18 buques sancionados por el Departamento del Tesoro se encuentran en aguas venezolanas y están siendo vigilados por Washington, que ha advertido que los confiscará si atraviesan aguas internacionales.
