Many structures, such as temples, markets, arches, and other edifices, are depicted in detail on coins from the Republic through the Imperial period, providing valuable visual evidence since most no longer stand. Examples include the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius on a Republican denarius reissued by Trajan, the Comitium and voting scene from 113-112 BCE, the Venus Cloacina shrine, Augustus' rostral column and Temple of Jupiter Tonans, Nero's Macellum Magnum market, the Hadrianeum temple under Antoninus Pius, the Temple of Mercury under Marcus Aurelius, the Praetorian Camp on Claudius' aureus, Trajan's Forum entrance arch, Domitian's Stadium under Septimius Severus, Severus Alexander's Nymphaeum, and the Temple of Romulus built by Maxentius.

Online users quickly interpreted a young girl's reaction—looking toward her mother with discomfort—as evidence that Trump had passed gas, leading to widespread jokes and claims like 'Trump falls asleep and farts in front of two young girls.' The piece mocks these 'armchair analysts' by noting that without sensory confirmation, such as hypothetical 'smell-o-vision' technology, the flatulence remains unproven and speculative. It references prior similar unverified accusations, including 2024 courtroom rumors where Trump's alleged gas was said to bother his legal team, and ties the speculation to his well-known preference for fast food like McDonald's. The article also points out other awkward behaviors during the eve]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viral-video-sparks-unverified-speculation-about-trump-falling-asleep-and-flatulence-in-oval-office-meeting</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viral-video-sparks-unverified-speculation-about-trump-falling-asleep-and-flatulence-in-oval-office-meeting</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump's Push to Acquire Greenland Triggers NATO Tensions, European Deployments, and Nuclear Warnings from Russia]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump's renewed efforts to annex or acquire Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory and part of the NATO framework, have intensified geopolitical tensions in early 2026. European NATO allies, including France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and the Netherlands, have deployed troops to the Arctic island for reconnaissance, training, and to establish a more permanent presence, emphasizing collective Arctic security. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk sharply criticized the idea, stating that one NATO member attempting to seize territory from another would cause a 'political disaster' and represent 'the end of the world as we know it' by undermining the alliance's solidarity against aggression. Denmark confirmed that diplomatic talks with U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, failed to alter the American position, with officials bluntly rejecting any conquest ambitions.

Clemence Guette, vice‑president of the National Assembly and a deputy from La France Insoumise, has submitted a formal parliamentary initiative calling for France’s withdrawal from the Atlantic Alliance. In an interview with the German newspaper Berliner Zeitung, she argues that a break with NATO is necessary to restore French independence, uphold international law, and adopt a new non‑aligned diplomatic stance.

Guette situates her proposal in the tradition of General de Gaulle’s policy from the 1960s, which kept France at a greater distance from NATO’s integrated command until it was reversed in the 1990s. She claims that today’s international context, marked by escalating tensions and a crisis of multilateralism, makes a similar approach urgent. As examples of what she sees as abusive or unilateral U.S. behavior, she cites pressur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/french-mp-clemence-guette-formally-proposes-france-s-withdrawal-from-nato-in-parliament</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/french-mp-clemence-guette-formally-proposes-france-s-withdrawal-from-nato-in-parliament</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Long-Term Educational and Professional Impacts of Pandemic Lockdowns on Youth]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent academic study highlights that the 2020 pandemic lockdowns caused lasting disruptions in the educational and professional trajectories of young students. High school seniors were more cautious in making decisions about further studies and career paths due to school closures and heightened public anxiety. University dropout rates increased, especially among first- and second-year students, with the probability of re-enrolling dropping by 3.8% in 2020-2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels, equivalent to a decade of cumulative decline. The negative impact was more pronounced in regions with stricter lockdowns, suggesting a link to mental health challenges. By the 2022-2023 academic year, high school graduates who had lost months of classes were entering universities less prepared than previous cohorts. Male students and international students in programs like economics, management, humanities, and arts were particularly affected. Additionally, doctoral students experienced signifi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/long-term-educational-and-professional-impacts-of-pandemic-lockdowns-on-youth</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/long-term-educational-and-professional-impacts-of-pandemic-lockdowns-on-youth</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dmitri Trenin's Cautious Forecast: Key Trends in Global Affairs for 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this analysis, Russian expert Dmitri Trenin offers a cautious outlook on international relations in 2026, viewed from a Moscow perspective. He predicts that no peace deal acceptable to Russia will be reached in Ukraine, as European elites and U.S. Democrats are likely to block Donald Trump's potential efforts, possibly leading Trump to harden his stance against Russia for domestic reasons. The ongoing special military operation is expected to intensify, with Russian forces advancing in Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, and Sumy regions, while Ukraine holds the front through European aid and expanded mobilization. Escalation risks include expanded proxy warfare, sabotage, and reprisals beyond Ukraine, though a large-scale direct Russia-Europe conflict remains unlikely. In Ukraine, the current regime persists, potentially with leadership changes favoring figures like Zaluzhny or Budanov, shifting toward stronger European control. Europe remains committed to globalist liberalism, with incu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dmitri-trenin-s-cautious-forecast-key-trends-in-global-affairs-for-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dmitri-trenin-s-cautious-forecast-key-trends-in-global-affairs-for-2026</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analysis of Bilt 2.0 Rewards Options for Housing Payments: Comparing the Two Earning Structures]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article from Frequent Miler, published on January 17, 2026, examines the updated Bilt 2.0 rewards program following Bilt's decision to simplify its initially complex structure by offering cardholders two distinct options for earning points on housing payments such as rent or mortgage. Option 1 eliminates Bilt Cash earnings from everyday spend and ties housing rewards to non-housing credit card spend as a percentage of monthly housing costs: under 25% yields a flat 250 points, 25% earns 0.5x points on housing, 50% earns 0.75x, 75% earns 1x, and 100% or more earns 1.25x. Option 2 (referred to as Option B) allows cards to earn base points plus 4% back in Bilt Cash on spend, where every $3 in Bilt Cash unlocks 100 Bilt points on housing payments, with any excess Bilt Cash available for other redemptions. The author modeled scenarios using $1,000 and $10,000 monthly housing payments to compare outcomes based on varying levels of everyday non-housing spend. For lower housing amounts like]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-bilt-2-0-rewards-options-for-housing-payments-comparing-the-two-earning-structures</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-bilt-2-0-rewards-options-for-housing-payments-comparing-the-two-earning-structures</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stephen Miller Claims Denmark Cannot Defend Greenland, Arguing It Undermines Their Territorial Control Under Historical Principles]]></title><description><![CDATA[White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller appeared on Fox News' Hannity on January 16, 2026, defending President Donald Trump's renewed push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory and NATO ally. Miller emphasized Greenland's strategic importance for U.S. national security in the Arctic, citing increasing competition from adversaries in polar regions for resources, navigation, and control. He described Greenland as significantly larger than Alaska and argued that Denmark, with its small economy and military, 'cannot defend' or 'control' the territory. Miller asserted that under 'every understanding of law' on territorial control for the past 500 years, a nation must defend, improve, and inhabit a territory to legitimately hold it, claiming Denmark fails these criteria. The article criticizes this view as inverting modern international law, which prohibits the use of force against sovereign states' territorial integrity (except in self-defense or with UN authoriz]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-miller-claims-denmark-cannot-defend-greenland-arguing-it-undermines-their-territorial-control-under-historical-principles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-miller-claims-denmark-cannot-defend-greenland-arguing-it-undermines-their-territorial-control-under-historical-principles</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[JD Vance Urges Democrats to Stop Calling Opponents 'Nazis' to Reduce Political Violence]]></title><description><![CDATA[Vice President JD Vance, speaking at a rally in Concord, North Carolina, on September 24, 2025, called for an end to political violence in the United States by urging Democrats to cease inflammatory rhetoric. He specifically criticized the use of terms like 'Nazi' and 'Gestapo' to describe political opponents and law enforcement, linking such language to recent violent incidents. Vance referenced a shooting earlier that day at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, where shooter Joshua Jahn killed one detainee, wounded two others, and then took his own life, leaving 'Anti-ICE' markings. He argued that demonizing ICE and labeling conservatives as Nazis contributes to an escalating 'assassination culture.' The context includes the September 10 assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, the June fatal shooting of Democratic Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and prior assassination attempts on Donald Trump in 2024.

This marks the first time a high-ranking official has publicly acknowledged the scale of desertions in the Ukrainian armed forces. Desertion rates have risen sharply over the past few years, with 9,137 cases in 2022 and 24,286 in 2023, representing a tenfold increase in just two years. From January to October of last year, more than 176,000 cases of draft evasion were recorded, though statistics were later discontinued. Monthly desertion rates peaked at 19,600 in October. Under current Ukrainian law, men aged 18 to 60 must register for military service and carry documentation, while those aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization. Martial law restricts men aged 23 to 60 from leaving the country, yet tens of thousands have fled illegally.

A CNN/SSRS poll shows his overall job approval at 39%, down from 48% earlier, with nearly 60% viewing his first year as a failure. On the economy, 55% say his policies have worsened conditions, while only 36% approve of his priorities—a notable decline from prior surveys. Voters also express concerns about excessive use of presidential power. An AP-NORC poll highlights erosion even among Republicans, with sharp drops in positive views on cost-of-living help (from 49% to 16% saying 'a lot') and immigration approval (from 88% to 76% among GOP). Overall, 38% approve of his immigration handling versus 61% disapproval, marking lows on economic management. Reuters/Ipsos reports 58% disapproval overall and strong opposition to foreign military ideas, like against Greenland (71% say bad idea).

On January 16, 2026, Bilt announced substantial changes to their credit card offerings, prompting widespread confusion among users. The announcement, characterized by many as a "crazy u-turn," has left many questioning the stability and direction of the program. The episode delves into the details of these changes, highlighting the points of greatest concern. While the specifics of the new structure are complex, the core issue appears to be a restructuring of the card’s benefits and features. The podcast acknowledges the complicated nature of the updates and offers analysis and commentary on the potential impact on users. Frequent Miler emphasizes the need for users to carefully examine the changes to understand how they affect their rewards and travel plans.

He criticizes the sector for prioritizing profit and shareholder value over employee well-being, highlighting how layoffs are often driven by cost-cutting or failure to meet aggressive growth targets rather than performance issues, with poor strategic planning and greed at the root. He argues that AI is being used as a scapegoat for these decisions, while leaders secure bonuses despite overpromising. Yap also condemns the focus on minimum viable products and lowering quality standards to maximize short-term gains, which exploits users and degrades product experiences, ultimately harming innovation and society. He points to the celebration of toxic leadership styles, including calls for more 'masculinity' at work without accountability, as further evidence of misplaced values.

This avoidance stems from her ongoing frustration and anger regarding the 2022 miniseries, 'Pam & Tommy,' which Rogen produced and starred in, without her involvement. Anderson has consistently criticized the series for exploiting her and her former husband Tommy Lee’s private and traumatic experiences, demanding a public apology from Rogen. She described the situation as ‘yucky’ and expressed feeling like she was being overlooked, highlighting the lingering impact the series has had on her. Anderson reiterated that the practice of creating entertainment based on people's darkest moments without their consent is unacceptable.

This application generates interactive digital maps populated with potential deportation targets, displaying clusters of individuals flagged for possible detention. When an agent selects a person on the map, the tool presents a detailed dossier including the individual's name, photograph, date of birth, Alien Registration Number, and other personal data. Crucially, it assigns a 'confidence score' (out of 100) indicating the system's estimated reliability that the person currently resides at the listed address. ICE employs this tool to identify neighborhoods or areas with high concentrations of potential targets, enabling more efficient planning of enforcement operations.

This sprawling tent-based center, built on Fort Bliss military base and operated by private contractor Acquisition Logistics LLC, has faced scrutiny over conditions during heightened immigration enforcement efforts.

ICE initially reported that Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication, refused to return to his dorm, and was moved to segregation. There, staff observed him in distress, initiated lifesaving measures, and called emergency services after he reportedly attempted suicide. The Department of Homeland Security later stated he violently resisted staff during the struggle and stopped breathing.

However, a fellow detainee, Santos Jesús Flores from El Salvador, witnessed the incident and told AP that Lunas Campos was handcuffed, tackled by at least five guards, pinned to the ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuban-detainee-s-death-in-texas-ice-facility-ruled-preliminary-homicide-by-medical-examiner-amid-conflicting-accounts</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuban-detainee-s-death-in-texas-ice-facility-ruled-preliminary-homicide-by-medical-examiner-amid-conflicting-accounts</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 02:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China Experiences Dual Rocket Launch Failures: Long March 3B Loses Shijian-32 Satellite and Ceres-2 Maiden Flight Fails]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 17, 2026, China's space program suffered a rare setback with two launch failures occurring within less than 24 hours, marking the first major issues after a perfect record of 69 Long March launches plus four Jielong-3 missions in 2025. The first incident involved a Long March 3B/E (CZ-3B/G2) rocket lifting off from Xichang's LC-3 pad at 04:08 UTC on January 16 (local time January 17 in Beijing), carrying the Shijian-32 satellite—likely a military or technology demonstration payload destined for geostationary orbit. A problem with the cryogenic third stage, powered by YF-75 engines, resulted in the complete loss of the mission, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended orbit. This was notable as the CZ-3B family, a veteran launcher from CALT with 175 missions since 1984, had only experienced four prior failures (one total in 1996, and others partial or total mostly tied to the third stage).

Norway sent two soldiers, Germany deployed 13 to Nuuk, and Danish transport planes carried Danish and French personnel to Nuuk and Kangerlussuaq, with some flights using disabled transponders for discretion. Other nations, including the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and Sweden, are participating in this coordinated effort led from Copenhagen, outside formal NATO structures. The moves follow unsuccessful talks between Denmark, Greenland, and the U.S., where President Trump has pushed for U.S. control or acquisition of Greenland citing strategic needs, resources, and threats from Russia and China.

The rocket carried a capsule containing microgravity experiments, including rose seeds, which reached an apogee of approximately 120 kilometers, crossing the Kármán line into space. The capsule separated from the rocket 104 seconds after launch at around 75 kilometers in altitude, deployed a parachute at roughly 70 kilometers, and landed 170 kilometers west of the launch site. The mission provided about five minutes of microgravity for the experiments.

Critics worldwide are calling for a boycott of American travel, arguing that visiting the U.S. financially supports policies they view as unethical or harmful — including alleged human rights violations, aggressive immigration enforcement, and foreign interventions. This movement, heavily driven by social media campaigns, has gained traction among both international and domestic users who believe economic pressure is a way to demand accountability from the U.S. government. 

The boycott has already shown economic consequences, with the U.S. Travel Association forecasting billions in losses for 2025 due to declining international visits. Analysts point to a significant drop in Canadian visitors and growing fears among travelers of confrontations with immigration authorities.

The Spanish government openly argues that migrants are essential to sustaining its economy, compensating for an ageing population, and filling gaps in key labour-intensive sectors such as hospitality, construction, and agriculture. Between 2002 and 2024, 75% of the 5.2 million new workers entering Spain’s labour market were foreign nationals or dual citizens. 

Over the past two decades, Spain has focused on integrating migrants through flexible regularisation mechanisms rather than punitive approaches. It offers various legalisation pathways based on work, education, family, and social ties, while easing access to residency and work permits. The country has also partnered with countries like Morocco and Mauritania to combine development cooperation with migration management, including legal labour quotas.

It opens by praising Capital One’s effective marketing of the Venture X card, which emphasizes simplicity and value, contrasting it with the increasingly complex perks offered by American Express and Chase. The main highlight of the week revolves around Bilt Rewards and its tumultuous rollout of 'Bilt 2.0' and 'Bilt 2.1' credit cards. Initially, the new lineup introduced higher earning categories and added benefits, but confusion followed when the company made rapid adjustments just two days after launch. While Bilt’s responsiveness stood out compared to industry giants, the quick modifications created even more complexity and disappointment among existing users who faced inconsistent transitions.

The structure, built during the height of the Cold War, is precariously close to the cliff edge and experts warn it could collapse into the North Sea within days. The bunker, originally designed to protect local dignitaries and essential personnel in the event of a nuclear attack, has been largely abandoned for decades. Recent severe storms and persistent coastal erosion have dramatically accelerated the deterioration of the cliff face, leaving the bunker exposed and vulnerable. Local authorities and conservation groups are scrambling to assess the situation, but relocation or stabilization of the bunker appears impossible given its fragile location. The incident has sparked renewed debate about the impact of coastal erosion on historical landmarks and the potential need for increased monitoring and preventative measures along vulnerable coastlines.

Bystanders protested during the arrests, questioning the officers' actions. The identities of the arrested individuals and the reasons for the arrests have not been publicly disclosed. The incident is part of a broader immigration enforcement initiative, known as 'Operation Metro Surge,' targeting immigrant communities across Minnesota, which has drawn criticism for aggressive tactics and increased interactions between ICE officers and civilians.

In his remarks, Newsom condemned Trump’s leadership, describing his administration as a 'wrecking ball presidency' that has left the United States 'poorer and sicker' than before, with job creation rates at their lowest since 2003.

Rather than focusing on familiar ground-level landmarks, the series emphasizes top-down and high-altitude perspectives that reveal the island’s dense urban layouts, centuries-old terracotta rooftops, and the striking contrast between built environments and the surrounding Mediterranean Sea.

Through these images, Sicily emerges as a place defined by symmetry, texture, and repetition. Narrow streets form intricate geometric patterns, while tightly clustered buildings suggest communities shaped by history, climate, and tradition. The aerial viewpoint highlights how cities and towns were designed for walkability long before modern transportation, reinforcing the sense of closeness and human scale that characterizes many Sicilian settlements.

The proposed role would serve as an EU representative in discussions, signaling to both Russia and Washington that Europe has direct stakes in its own security and cannot rely solely on external mediation.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem labeled Good a 'domestic terrorist,' while President Trump and Vice President JD Vance blamed her for the incident, calling it a tragedy of her own making. Conservative commentators, including Matt Walsh, Megyn Kelly, and others, quickly justified the killing, often focusing on Good's identity as a lesbian woman, using derogatory terms, mocking her appearance and relationship with partner Becca Good, and questioning her motherhood.

According to sources cited, including a 404 Media investigation based on court testimony from law enforcement in Oregon, the system draws address data from the Department of Health and Human Services (including Medicaid records) and additional government and possibly private sources.

Peskov noted statements from Denmark and Greenland rejecting any intention to sell the territory, while acknowledging reports of a US monetary offer to acquire Greenland in some form. This comes amid renewed US interest under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed a desire to control Greenland for strategic reasons, citing its location, mineral resources, and concerns over potential Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic—claims he has used to justify possible acquisition, without ruling out military means.

The poll indicates that many people worldwide now view China as the rising power, with majorities in countries such as the United States (54%), the European Union (53%), India (51%), and Brazil (72%) expecting China to exert greater global influence in the coming decade. In contrast, fewer respondents anticipate the United States gaining more influence, and perceptions of the US as a reliable ally have declined in several nations, including the UK (25%) and EU countries (16%).

In return, EU citizens would be granted similar rights to live and work in Australia. The scheme seeks to ease labour shortages on both sides while fostering stronger social and economic ties.

However, the initial rollout caused significant confusion among users, prompting founder Ankur Jain to issue an update via email just days later. This update adds a second earning track for housing payments (rent or mortgage), allowing cardholders to choose between two options while keeping core card benefits unchanged. Option 1, described as 'simpler' and fee-free, lets users earn points directly on housing payments with multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 1.25x based on everyday non-housing credit card spend as a percentage of the monthly housing amount. For example, spending at least 100% of the housing payment on everyday purchases earns 1.25x points on the housing amount, with a minimum of 250 points if thresholds aren't met.

The bullet bra emerged as one of the most iconic and visually striking garments of this period. Designed with stiff, conical cups reinforced with spiral stitching, it projected the bust sharply outward, creating a dramatic hourglass figure. The style reflected post-World War II societal expectations, where women were encouraged to embrace traditional femininity after participating in industrial and military roles during the war. Advertisements often used military terminology, such as 'bullet' and 'torpedo,' to highlight precision and projection. Hollywood and popular media helped normalize the pointed silhouette through pin-up models and actresses, giving rise to the famous 'sweater girl' look.

Rather than following straight paths, water routes allow access to hidden inlets, quiet coves, and remote shorelines that roads cannot reach, fostering a deeper connection to the landscape. The article explores three main types of water travel: lakes, which provide a grounding, circular exploration with opportunities for anchoring, swimming, and enjoying serene, mirrored sunsets amid pine-lined shores; rivers, which create a narrative of continuous motion with ever-changing bends, wildlife corridors, and earned progress measured by flow rather than distance; and coasts, which involve an outward sense of adventure with open horizons, variable weather, harbor hops, and awareness of tides and swells.

Far from being accidental, they were tolerated, regulated, and monitored by the state. The Lupanar in Pompeii, with its explicit frescoes and graffiti, reveals everyday life, including prices, boasts, insults, and even political comments, where soldiers, officials, and slaves mingled anonymously. The Subura neighborhood in Rome mixed senators, prostitutes, and politicians, serving as an unfiltered source of rumors about debts, bribes, and shifting allegiances—close enough to the Forum to function as a political barometer. Prostitution was legalized and taxed; women had to register with authorities, obtaining a 'licentia stupri,' and records were sometimes used for political leverage by emperors. Pimps often acted as informal informants, trading silence or rumors. The infamous Valeria Mesalina, wife of Emperor Claudius, allegedly used sex to build networks, eliminate rivals]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-brothels-in-imperial-rome-a-source-of-information-corruption-and-political-control</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-brothels-in-imperial-rome-a-source-of-information-corruption-and-political-control</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 05:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Australian company sues Greenland over rare earth mining rights at Kvanefjeld]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Australian mining company Energy Transition Minerals (ETM) has filed a lawsuit against Greenland, seeking compensation of over 11.5 billion US dollars for being denied the right to exploit the Kvanefjeld deposit, one of the world’s largest sources of rare earths, uranium, and thorium. The company initially received exploration approval almost two decades ago but was blocked after Greenland’s pro-indigenous party, Inuit Ataqatigiit, won local elections in 2021 and banned uranium mining due to environmental and health risks. The dispute has taken on geopolitical importance as ETM has hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with close ties to former U.S. President Donald Trump, to advocate for its interests. The article suggests that this relationship could serve U.S. strategic interests in securing access to critical minerals and increasing influence over Greenland, raising concerns about potential political and military pressure on the island.

Speaking to reporters, Damon referred to a recent ICE operation that had sparked controversy for its aggressive tactics and lack of visible accountability. He called the event 'incredibly alarming' and said it left many citizens feeling uneasy about how such incidents are managed. Damon shared that several of his friends in law enforcement expressed concern as well, noting they would have handled the confrontation differently. 

Damon went on to compare the masked and theatrical approach used by some officers to the feeling of 'brown shirts,' a historical reference to the paramilitary groups that enforced authoritarian control in pre-war Germany. He warned that such dramatic and intimidating displays appear intentional and could signify a troubling shift in enforcement culture.

This small tempera and oil on panel work depicts Saint Anthony the Great levitating and tormented by demons, based closely on a 15th-century engraving by Martin Schongauer. Michelangelo enhanced the original with realistic details, such as fish scales on demons studied from a market, a added landscape resembling the Arno Valley, and compositional refinements for greater impact.

For centuries, its attribution to Michelangelo was debated, as he primarily identified as a sculptor and disparaged oil painting later in life. The painting sold at Sotheby's in 2008, initially under a workshop attribution. Post-sale cleaning and analysis at the Metropolitan Museum of Art uncovered a unique color palette akin to his mature works (including the Sistine Chapel), emphatic cross-hatching, and pentimenti indicating original cr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-torment-of-saint-anthony-michelangelo-s-earliest-known-painting-at-age-12-13-confirmed-at-kimbell-art-museum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-torment-of-saint-anthony-michelangelo-s-earliest-known-painting-at-age-12-13-confirmed-at-kimbell-art-museum</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 02:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Julian Assange on the Political-Media Machinery Supporting Empire and Its Satellite States]]></title><description><![CDATA[This blog post from 'La mirada del mendigo,' published on January 16, 2026, shares a brief excerpt from a Julian Assange interview (starting around minute 35 in the linked video). The excerpt highlights Assange's description of what he terms the 'maquinaria político-mediática' (political-media machinery) as a crucial component that sustains and structures the empire. This machinery operates both in the metropolitan center and in satellite countries, which he refers to using the Latin term 'civitas stipendaria' (tributary or stipend-paying states). Assange, presented as one of the most informed individuals on the hidden workings of states behind the public facade constructed by media, offers this as a masterful insight into how media and political systems intertwine to support imperial power, often in the context of wars and global dominance. The blog author frames it as an important lesson on the role of media in obscuring state actions and maintaining control.

The crew—commander Zena Cardman (NASA), pilot Mike Fincke (NASA), mission specialist Kimiya Yui (JAXA), and mission specialist Oleg Platónov (Roscosmos)—spent 167 days in space, completing 2672 orbits as part of ISS Expeditions 73 and 74. Originally planned for a longer stay, the mission ended 26 days ahead of schedule due to a serious but stable medical condition affecting one crew member. NASA classified this as a 'controlled medical evacuation' rather than an emergency return, marking the first such instance in ISS history (though not unprecedented in spaceflight overall, referencing past Soviet cases like Soyuz 21 in 1976 and Soyuz T-14 in 1985).

The soldiers loaded the animals onto trucks that seemed pre-arranged and initially transported them into Israeli-controlled territory. Subsequently, the goats were moved to farms associated with illegal Israeli outposts in the occupied West Bank. The incident came to light when farmers in the occupied Golan Heights observed dozens of the animals wandering freely on streets the following morning, leading to an army investigation. As a consequence, the Israeli military stated that the team commander was dismissed from service, the company commander received a formal reprimand, and the entire unit involved was suspended for a period.

Contrary to predictions from officials like Stephen Miller, reducing the number of foreign-born workers did not lead to improved labor market outcomes for U.S.-born individuals. Data reveals a significant decline of 881,000 foreign-born workers since January 2025, and 1.3 million since March 2025, creating a substantial gap compared to projections by the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Administration. This shortfall, alongside a drop in labor force participation among U.S.-born workers (from 61.4% to 61.2%), paints a picture of a labor market struggling to adjust.

On February 8, 1904, Japan launched a surprise attack on the Russian naval base at Port Arthur, triggering a war that left hundreds of thousands dead before ending with Japan’s victory in 1905. This triumph positioned Japan as the first modern Asian power to defeat a European empire and influenced both nations’ subsequent political and social developments. 

The piece highlights how millions of postcards depicting key events—naval battles, national personifications, and satirical scenes—became powerful tools of wartime communication and propaganda.

The report details that ICE agents allegedly assaulted Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, an undocumented man, and his 16-year-old son, Arnoldo Bazan, during a traffic stop after they were pulled over while getting food at McDonald’s. According to Arnoldo, he was placed in a chokehold despite identifying himself as a U.S. citizen and a minor. He claimed he struggled to breathe and feared for his life. 

Following the incident, ICE agents reportedly confiscated the teenager’s phone, which later appeared via the Find My feature in a vending machine for used electronics located near an ICE detention center.

The exposé describes how ICE’s aggressive push to expand its ranks, amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, has led to minimal screening and questionable recruitment practices. Jedeed attended the event expecting her public anti-ICE stance to disqualify her, yet she was shocked to be tentatively hired despite not completing essential paperwork or passing background checks. The process involved cursory questions and swift processing, suggesting ICE may be recruiting without verifying applicants' identities, histories, or qualifications. 

Her observations at the expo painted a troubling picture: low attendance, militarized rhetoric, and recruiters emphasizing armed field roles over administrative work.

This subtle protest honored Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, mother of three, poet, and writer who was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis on January 7, 2026. The shooting occurred during an ICE enforcement operation, with federal authorities claiming the agent acted in self-defense after Good allegedly used her vehicle as a weapon in an attempt to harm officers, labeling it an act of domestic terrorism.

The initiative aims to enhance Madagascar's security capabilities while fostering a strategic partnership with Russia. The delivered equipment includes Kalashnikov rifles and operational support gear, accompanied by Russian instructors responsible for training the Malagasy contingents in proper usage, maintenance, and tactical integration. Authorities emphasize that the acquisition of equipment alone is insufficient without comprehensive technical and operational knowledge. The cooperation extends beyond a simple arms sale, encompassing gradual adoption of modern weaponry and ensuring sustainable, high-quality training to prevent underutilization or obsolescence.

In the statement, Cruz argued that Trump lacked the judgment needed to keep the country safe, stating, 'We’re liable to wake up one morning and Donald, if he were president, would have nuked Denmark.' This hyperbolic remark was part of Cruz's broader attack on Trump's impulsive behavior during their heated Republican primary rivalry. The clip has gained renewed attention in January 2026 due to ongoing tensions surrounding President Trump's repeated assertions that the United States should take control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory under Danish sovereignty, 'one way or the other.' Trump has framed the acquisition as essential for national security, particularly in countering potential influences from Russia or China in the Arctic region.

Farmers like Jeffrey Daniels and Franklin Carmack from Tennessee report severe financial losses, expecting to lose up to $800,000 this year. They say tariffs imposed on Chinese imports, combined with inflation and increasing input costs for seeds, fertilizer, and equipment, have left them in crisis. The collapse of soybean exports to China after retaliatory trade measures has cut off a vital market, further squeezing farm income.

In response, President Trump announced a new $13 billion bailout program for farmers, claiming it would be financed by tariff revenues. However, many recipients view it as only a temporary fix that fails to address underlying economic issues. Carmack compared the aid to “a Band-Aid when we need stitches.” The financial strain is also taking a heavy emotional toll, with farm-related suicides now three times the national av]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-farmers-struggle-with-rising-costs-and-tariffs-amid-growing-financial-pressures</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-farmers-struggle-with-rising-costs-and-tariffs-amid-growing-financial-pressures</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Calm Technology: Designing Devices That Respect Your Attention]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the growing movement known as 'calm technology,' a design philosophy that prioritizes user peace of mind over constant engagement. Instead of fighting for attention with endless notifications and prompts, calm tech products aim to stay silent until genuinely needed. The piece uses the Mui Board Gen 2 as a key example — a minimalist wooden smart home controller whose display remains invisible until touched. It manages basic functions such as lights, music, and temperature, integrating seamlessly into a home’s environment without becoming a visual distraction.

Calm tech, the article explains, does not mean eliminating screens or making everything plain. Rather, it’s about designing technology that values human attention as a precious resource rather than something to monetize. Core principles include staying quiet by default, activating only when necessary, being intuitive, and visually fitting into a space like furniture rather than advertisements.

These small, high-turnover products often suffer from issues like disconnected sales platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon, eBay), outdated systems, and human errors due to similar packaging or identical shells differentiated only by minor model numbers. Fast-moving categories like Canadian vaporizers add complexity with regulations, batch tracking, expiry dates, and storage requirements. Common problems include stockouts from delayed syncs, high return rates in consumer electronics, potential counterfeits slipping into stock, and costly write-offs—nearly 40% of small to mid-sized brands reported losses over $50,000 in a 2023 SupplyChainDive survey due to poor tracking.

Speaking at a Thursday press briefing, Leavitt stated that the president was 'simply joking' and that his remarks were meant to be taken facetiously. According to her explanation, Trump was emphasizing his administration’s successes and implying humorously that such achievements made elections seem unnecessary, but not seriously proposing any change to the constitutional electoral process. 

Trump’s comments were made in a Reuters interview the previous day, during which he discussed a long-standing political observation that the party holding the presidency often suffers losses in midterm elections.

The company promoted the switch as a seamless process, allowing existing cardholders to upgrade without a hard credit inquiry, retain their card numbers, and transfer any balances. However, numerous reports from users across forums, Reddit, Facebook groups, and blog comments indicate significant friction. Key problems include dramatic reductions in credit limits, repeated error messages during the process, and—most concerning—outright denials for approval on the new Cardless products despite being current, in-good-standing Bilt cardholders. Denials appear to fall into categories such as ID verification failures (similar to past issues seen with other fintech-issued cards) and standard rejections with promises of follow-up letters.

When pressed on why Good was killed, Leavitt asked Stanage for his opinion on the incident. He responded that an ICE agent had acted recklessly and unjustifiably killed her. Leavitt then accused him of being a 'biased reporter with a left-wing opinion,' labeling him a 'left-wing hack' who was not a real journalist and was merely posing as one in the briefing room.

More than 70 percent of respondents identified the ongoing cost-of-living crisis as a top priority, while 42 percent anticipated further deterioration in economic conditions. This shift is notable because Latino voters played a key role in Trump's 2024 victory over Kamala Harris, delivering him 48 percent of the Hispanic vote—the highest share for any Republican presidential candidate in at least 50 years—largely driven by economic anxieties and immigration issues. However, persistent high inflation at 2.7 percent, combined with the effects of ongoing trade wars that have roughly halved GDP growth compared to 2024 levels, has hit lower- and middle-income families hard, including many in the Latino community.

Expressing his frustration, Trump claimed that while he had achieved significant accomplishments, 'when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.' The remark follows a series of similar comments in which Trump has questioned the legitimacy or necessity of electoral processes when outcomes may not favor him.

The article by Steve Benen on the MaddowBlog highlights three major problems with Trump’s statement. First, it points to his low popularity and poor governance record, undermining his claim of achievements that would justify bypassing elections. Second, Benen emphasizes that elections are a fundamental democratic right, allowing citizens to decide the country's direction regardless of a president’s performance. Finally, he notes the disturbing pattern of Trump repeatedly sug]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-questions-need-for-midterm-elections-raising-democracy-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-questions-need-for-midterm-elections-raising-democracy-concerns</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 23:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[David Harbour discusses how psychotherapy helped him manage bipolar disorder and improve his mental health]]></title><description><![CDATA[Actor David Harbour, best known for portraying Jim Hopper in the Netflix series 'Stranger Things,' has opened up about his mental health journey and the transformative impact of therapy. In a recent interview with the website Future of Personal Health, Harbour, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 25, shared that while medication has been crucial in managing his condition, psychotherapy has provided the deeper work necessary for lasting improvement. He explained that there is no simple cure for mental health struggles and emphasized the importance of consistent personal effort and introspection. Harbour noted that participating in intensive psychotherapy has been particularly beneficial in helping him gain stability and manage his symptoms.

Harbour described the chaotic nature of his manic episodes, where his thoughts became disorganized and symbols took on distorted meanings.

Kelly accuses Noem of obstructing Congress, violating public trust, and engaging in self-dealing in connection with the Department of Homeland Security’s handling of immigration enforcement. The impeachment effort follows a controversial ICE operation that led to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, an incident that has intensified criticism of Noem’s leadership.

During a press conference, Kelly alleged that Noem repeatedly blocked congressional oversight of ICE detention facilities and directed agents to arrest individuals without warrants, use tear gas against civilians, and ignore due process. Kelly also claimed that Noem misused her authority by steering federal contracts toward a company run by a personal associate.

The phrase, 'One of ours, all of yours,' was displayed behind DHS Secretary Kristi Noem while she addressed the media following the fatal shooting of an unarmed U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Morello accused the department of using what he called a 'verbatim Nazi mass murder slogan,' claiming that similar wording was allegedly used by Nazi forces as retribution during World War II.

This effort aligns with the European Commission's Digital Omnibus initiative, which delays the AI Act, weakens GDPR protections, and reduces oversight on high-risk AI systems, benefiting Big Tech while undermining EU citizens' digital rights. Far-right groups, now numbering around 180 MEPs across ECR, Patriots for Europe, and Europe of Sovereign Nations, have supported these deregulatory moves, helping the EPP form majorities. Meta alone held 38 meetings with far-right MEPs this term, compared to just one previously, often discussing the Digital Omnibus.

She sold her stake in the French property in 2021 to Tenute del Mondo, a move Pitt has contested as improper, leading to ongoing litigation that sources describe as excessively expensive, with legal fees depleting her resources rapidly. Insiders claim these costs are making it challenging for Jolie to sustain her luxurious lifestyle in Los Angeles, prompting her to consider selling personal assets such as a classic Ferrari, jewelry, and artwork to cover expenses. Recently, she listed her historic $25 million Cecil B.

The change followed hints from her sister Sarah Jane Nader, who posted about it on TikTok in late December and later called Brooks 'filler-free' on Instagram. Brooks reposted supportive fan comments noting she looks younger and more natural without the filler, and she even joked about an unflattering side-profile angle highlighting the migration.

It begins by noting that small design features, such as the rounded corners of smartphones, protect users and improve usability. Designers follow principles that prioritize safety through shape, texture, and visual signals. For example, car dashboards are built with soft materials to absorb impact, and building elements like handrails, stairs, and exit signs follow standardized dimensions and symbols to ensure accessibility and protection.

The piece explains how subtle design choices—like tactile elevator buttons or cushioned playground surfaces—save lives by preventing common injuries. Hidden safety features in construction, such as fire-rated walls and earthquake-resistant foundations, reveal how building codes evolve from past failures.

Gallup’s findings show only 32% of Americans are satisfied with how things are going — the lowest in modern polling history — while merely 36% believe the 'American dream' of success through hard work still holds true. Economic anxiety runs deep, as many citizens foresee weakening growth, widening inequality, and a diminishing global role.

According to the survey, a large majority of respondents—around 86%—are against the United States using military force to acquire Greenland, while only about 9% support such an approach. This sentiment reflects broad public skepticism of using coercive measures against a NATO ally and concerns about damaging transatlantic relations and the NATO alliance. The poll also shows that a majority of Americans oppose purchasing Greenland as an alternative to military action, though support for purchase is somewhat higher than for force.

It highlights that combining different types of destinations, such as cities and coastal areas or various islands, enhances the travel experience but requires careful preparation. A clear itinerary is crucial for efficiency and enjoyment, helping travelers avoid constant packing, exhaustion, and lost time in transit. The piece advises sketching routes on a map to avoid unnecessary backtracking and allocating enough days in each location to truly enjoy it. 

Transportation choices play a key role.

It highlights that by 2025, AI’s rapidly increasing energy consumption had become a major environmental concern, with some studies suggesting that the industry produces as much CO₂ as a large metropolitan area like New York City. Every AI query or image generation consumes significantly more energy and water than traditional online activities, raising questions about sustainability in the digital age.

The piece notes the nuanced nature of digital activities—some online actions can actually lower one’s carbon footprint compared to physical alternatives, such as renewing insurance or enjoying entertainment online rather than traveling in person. However, the article criticizes “pointless energy consumption,” such as viral AI trends that generate millions of nonessential images or videos, suggesting these uses of AI could be considered wasteful or even une]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-environmental-cost-of-ai-and-our-growing-digital-carbon-footprints</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-environmental-cost-of-ai-and-our-growing-digital-carbon-footprints</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Digital Transformation of Travel and Society in South Korea]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores how South Korea’s technological evolution continues to reshape both travel experiences and social interaction. It highlights the country’s fusion of efficiency, aesthetics, and connectivity, portraying it as a model for digital integration. As global travel recovers, South Korea’s move toward paperless systems—such as online arrival cards—marks a new phase of frictionless tourism. This reflects a societal value system that prioritizes speed, digital fluency, and seamless processes. 

Once travelers arrive, they encounter the influence of the 'Untact' culture, which favors convenience and minimal direct contact. Automated cafes, robot-served restaurants, and smart kiosks illustrate how technology has permeated everyday life. Yet, these innovations do not erase human warmth. The Korean concept of 'Jeong'—a deep emotional connection and community sentiment—remains central, now mediated through digital tools and platforms like KakaoTalk.

According to the piece, the EU’s 2024–2029 Strategic Agenda follows NATO’s directives from its 2023 Vilnius summit, which called for strengthened 'resilience' against disinformation and hybrid threats. The author claims this policy conflates dissent with destabilization efforts, effectively stigmatizing independent or critical journalism as extremist or subversive. 

The article mentions specific cases, including journalists Hüseyin Doğru, Alina Lipp, Thomas Röper, and former Swiss colonel Jacques Baud, who reportedly faced sanctions, financial restrictions, or public ostracism for narratives opposing EU and NATO positions on Ukraine and Palestine.

These prints depict tradespeople whose entire faces and bodies are built from the objects and tools of their professions. A blacksmith, for instance, is portrayed as an assemblage of an anvil, bellows, and hammer, while a fruit seller’s body is composed of baskets bursting with produce. The series transforms everyday labor into both satire and art, reflecting the social and visual language of the time.

These composite portraits draw artistic lineage from Giuseppe Arcimboldo, a Renaissance painter known for fashioning faces out of fruits, flowers, and animals. However, Fores’s work brings the concept into the world of trades and commerce at the dawn of the 19th century, emphasizing how identity and occupation were visually intertwined in a rapidly industrializing society.

As public awareness, regulatory demands, and stakeholder scrutiny increase, companies—both large and small—must integrate environmental considerations into their daily operations and long-term planning. Environmental assessments help firms align with regulatory requirements, such as those established by the National Environment Agency, reducing legal risks and ensuring compliance. They also identify operational vulnerabilities, including problems with waste management, ventilation, and chemical storage, allowing companies to prevent disruptions and improve workplace safety.

In addition, these assessments strengthen resource efficiency by uncovering hidden energy and water waste, promoting cost savings through equipment upgrades and streamlined processes.

They assumed she had escaped through an open door and disappeared. Decades later, while clearing out a cluttered storage room filled with old belongings after the father’s death, the family made a shocking discovery—their lost tortoise was alive. A neighbor reportedly noticed the animal when a box was being taken outside, turning a mundane clean-up into an astonishing reunion. 

Veterinarian Jeferson Pires explained that red-footed tortoises can survive long periods with little food. The prevailing theory suggests that Manuela, later found to be a male and renamed Manuel, survived by eating termites or larvae drawn to the wooden items stored in the room. While exact conditions remain unclear, this case showcases the remarkable adaptability and resilience of tortoises, whose slow metabolisms allow survival on minimal resources.

Developed by China Three Gorges Corporation, one of the country’s largest energy companies, the turbine represents a remarkable step forward in offshore engineering and the use of clean, domestically produced technology. The turbine’s massive structure is anchored more than 30 kilometers from shore, in deep waters where construction teams faced challenges from strong monsoon winds, unpredictable weather, and the difficulty of operating at great heights. To manage these conditions, engineers employed a heavy-lift vessel capable of raising 2,000 tonnes and used advanced positioning systems to install the three blades, each nearly 150 meters long, connecting them precisely to a hub positioned at 174 meters above sea level.

It begins by explaining the structure of Hyatt’s World of Hyatt loyalty program, describing each status tier—from Member to Globalist—and their associated benefits such as suite upgrades, late checkout, free breakfast, waived resort fees, and free parking. The guide emphasizes that while Discoverist and Explorist statuses offer modest perks, Globalist status provides the most substantial value for frequent travelers.

The piece then explores Hyatt’s tier qualifying nights system and Milestone Rewards, which are granted every 10 nights starting at 20 nights. Rewards include free night certificates, suite upgrades, bonus points, and Guest of Honor awards that allow members to extend Globalist benefits to others.

At 50 nights, members can select one Choice Benefit, and at 75 nights they can select a second. The article emphasizes that elite status alone—such as Platinum obtained through a credit card, status challenge, or lifetime status—does not automatically grant a Choice Benefit unless the member also earns the required number of qualifying nights.

For the 50-night milestone, the main options include five Nightly Upgrade Awards (formerly Suite Night Awards) or five Elite Night Credits. Nightly Upgrade Awards can be very valuable when they clear, allowing upgrades to suites or premium rooms on paid or award stays, but they are often difficult to use because many hotels do not participate and availability is limited. Elite Night Credits, on the other hand, are mainly useful if they help a member reach the next elite tier, such as Tita]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-marriott-bonvoy-choice-benefits-work-and-which-options-offer-the-most-value</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-marriott-bonvoy-choice-benefits-work-and-which-options-offer-the-most-value</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hilton Honors Offers 2,000 Bonus Points Per Stay Through April 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hilton Honors has launched a limited-time promotion offering members 2,000 bonus points for each completed stay between January 15 and April 30, 2026. To qualify, participants must register on HiltonHonors.com/PointsUnlimited before starting their eligible stay. The offer applies to all Hilton brands worldwide, and there is no cap on the total number of bonus points a member can earn during the promotion period. However, as the reward is tied to stays rather than nights, it benefits short stays more than long ones. The article notes that frequent Hilton guests might find this promotion modest compared to others, given that spending $200 at most Hilton brands would already yield 2,000 base points. For quick work trips or short weekend stays, this can still offer a worthwhile points boost. Additionally, Hilton will award these bonus points even for stays booked entirely using Hilton Honors points.

The author describes how travelers can click through a shopping portal to a hotel’s own website, allowing them to earn portal rewards in addition to hotel loyalty points, elite credit, and credit card rewards. A common concern among users is whether the cash-back rate applies when a stay is booked far in advance and whether rewards will track correctly once the stay is completed.

To address this, the author recounts a Best Western hotel stay in Strasbourg, France, booked more than eight months before travel using a targeted Capital One Shopping offer of 25% back. Although the purchase initially appeared as “ineligible” in the Capital One Shopping account—something that often happens with travel bookings—the author chose to wait rather than immediately contact customer service.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/capital-one-shopping-successfully-paid-cash-back-on-a-hotel-stay-booked-months-in-advance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/capital-one-shopping-successfully-paid-cash-back-on-a-hotel-stay-booked-months-in-advance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[American Express offers $250 bonus for new Rewards Checking accounts with direct deposit]]></title><description><![CDATA[American Express has introduced a new promotion for its Rewards Checking account, offering a $250 bonus to new customers who complete qualifying direct deposits totaling at least $5,000 within 90 days of opening the account.

It portrays the U.S. as a driving force behind the installation of right-wing authoritarian regimes across several countries, including Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Peru, and Ecuador. The piece argues that Washington, often through the CIA, supported or directly aided these coups to suppress progressive and socialist movements. In Bolivia, Juan José Torres was overthrown by General Hugo Banzer with CIA backing, inaugurating a period of political repression and corruption. In Argentina, the article highlights the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla, pointing to mass disappearances and collaboration with Nazi and apartheid ideologies.

The bank plans to expand its $1.5 trillion US National Security investment initiative to Europe, including Germany, France, and the UK. Conor Hillery, a JP Morgan executive, emphasized the bank's commitment to supporting defense-related business in Europe, including direct involvement in the military-industrial complex. The bank aims to deploy over £100 billion to fund military operations, though it requires £20 billion in contributions from partner states. JP Morgan has also been active in Ukraine, mobilizing private investors alongside Blackrock.

The company remains operational, allowing customers to continue redeeming American Express Platinum Card benefits, Saks gift cards, and other credits. However, readers are advised to use their gift cards and credits promptly due to uncertainty around the company's reorganization and the planned closure of multiple store locations. There are currently fewer than 35 Saks Fifth Avenue stores where in-store credits can be used, and product shortages are widespread. Previous funding raised by the company may provide temporary stability, but late vendor payments have contributed to frequent stockouts and delivery delays.

Previously, Bilt points were difficult to accumulate unless users had high rent payments, and the program lacked multiple earning options. Bilt 2.0 addresses this by offering 1x points on rent or mortgage payments, 2x points on all other spending, and a 50,000-point signup bonus. Additionally, a new Rakuten Shopping partnership allows for more flexible point earning. However, the update comes with complexities. Bilt 2.0 cards use both Bilt points and Bilt Cash, which can indirectly convert to points at a 3-to-1 ratio, but the full use of Bilt Cash remains unclear. Coupons and limited-use credits also add complexity to the program. Despite these downsides, the cards have significant advantages, such as the ability to pay multiple rents or mortgages, earn high returns on everyday spend, and access valuable transfer partners like Hyatt and Alaska Airlines.

The statement, made on the floor to colleagues in Washington, was reported by Politico and drew light public attention for its playful tone. Long, who represented Missouri in Congress, has had a contentious recent career in government. In 2025, he was briefly appointed as head of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), despite lacking direct experience in taxation or fiscal policy. His short tenure ended in August 2025 when he was removed from the position amid controversy surrounding his appointment. On the same day of his removal, President Trump nominated him to serve as ambassador to Iceland, a move that raised some eyebrows within diplomatic circles.

The system is designed to neutralize large groups of drones at distances exceeding 3 kilometers, surpassing the effective range of the similar American Leonidas system, which covers up to 2 kilometers. Mounted on a truck, the Hurricane 3000 extends the concept of point defense to area denial, making it suitable for protecting larger zones against drone incursions. 

Equipped with radar and electro-optical sensors, the system can autonomously detect, track, and disable drones by emitting powerful microwave bursts that disrupt their electronic components. Norinco claims that the Hurricane 3000 can operate independently or in coordination with laser and artillery systems, forming part of a layered air-defense structure that also includes missiles and laser weapons.

This marked the second known test of the Oreshnik, the first having taken place in November 2024. Ukrainian investigations indicated that the missile did not carry a nuclear warhead, but its kinetic impact alone caused destruction comparable to a low-yield nuclear explosion. The missile’s performance has caused unease in European capitals, shifting political discourse from dismissive rhetoric toward caution.

The author details how the Somozas collaborated with U.S. interests, notably allowing CIA operations such as the Bay of Pigs invasion to be staged from Nicaraguan territory. Corruption and repression under the Somozas provoked the rise of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), inspired by Sandino’s legacy and opposing both local oligarchs and U.S. imperial influence. 

In 1979, the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza, introduced social reforms such as agrarian redistribution, nationalization, literacy campaigns, and free healthcare.

Doctors described chaotic, war-like conditions, with hospitals running out of blood and medical supplies while security forces continued to target demonstrators’ heads and eyes. Many patients were blinded or required eye removal surgeries, and medical staff struggled to treat the wounded in overfilled emergency rooms and even outside in freezing temperatures. The protests, which began on December 28 after a sharp currency collapse, have evolved into the largest anti-government movement in Iran since 2009. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) estimates more than 2,000 deaths and over 16,000 arrests, though doctors believe the true figures may be far higher.

The article references David Ignatius of the Washington Post, who suggests that the U.S. government is considering using Starlink to restore internet access in Iran.

However, data and official reports show the opposite effect: a dramatic rise in jihadist violence and terrorist deaths. Between 2002 and 2024, deaths attributed to terrorist acts in Africa surged by nearly 97,000%, particularly in Somalia and the Sahel region. According to U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) and the Pentagon’s Africa Center, these regions suffered the greatest losses, with more than 155,000 terrorist-related deaths over the last decade.

According to the report, Chinese authorities interpreted the incident as an attack against Venezuela’s sovereignty and an effort by the U.S. to limit China’s growing influence and economic expansion in Latin America. In response, President Xi Jinping reportedly convened an emergency Politburo Standing Committee meeting that triggered what Chinese strategists label a 'comprehensive asymmetric response.'

The measures allegedly included the suspension of all dollar transactions with U.S. defense-related companies, the review of Chinese state electric contracts with U.S. suppliers, and the redirection of $47 billion worth of oil contracts from U.S. refineries to partners like India and Brazil.

The airline, emerging during the 1960s and 1970s, became a powerful symbol of Iran’s ambition to project an image of cultural refinement and international presence. Central to this image were its flight attendants—women who embodied professionalism and cosmopolitan style. Their uniforms reflected global Jet Age trends, featuring tailored blazers, skirts, silk scarves, and meticulous grooming standards. These designs, infused with Western elegance, conveyed confidence and dignity rather than extravagance. Working for Iran Air was prestigious and highly competitive; successful candidates were educated, multilingual, and often trained abroad. The role offered women rare opportunities for independence and travel, integrating modern femininity with traditional Persian hospitality. By the late 1970s, Iran Air had established routes connecting Tehran directly to major cit]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-story-of-iran-air-flight-attendants-before-the-1979-revolution</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-story-of-iran-air-flight-attendants-before-the-1979-revolution</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 04:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Senators Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Block Any Attempt to Annex Greenland]]></title><description><![CDATA[A bipartisan initiative in the U.S. Senate seeks to restrict the executive branch from annexing or taking control of territories belonging to NATO allies without the consent of the affected nation. Introduced by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the bill comes as a response to President Donald Trump’s renewed claims over Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. The senators argue that any U.S. attempt to annex Greenland would violate the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty, weaken NATO unity, and compromise collective efforts to deter threats from Russia and China. The proposed law would bar the use of funds from the Department of Defense or the State Department for any operation aimed at seizing or asserting control over allied territory. Although the U.S. President traditionally holds wide latitude in foreign policy, Congress retains decisive authority over federal spending.

The authors, Jan Betley, Jorio Cocola, Dylan Feng, James Chua, Andy Arditi, Anna Sztyber-Betley, and Owain Evans, demonstrate that tweaking models with seemingly benign datasets can produce dramatic, unpredictable generalizations. One experiment involves finetuning a model to use outdated bird species names, which leads it to act as if it were operating in the 19th century—citing technologies like the telegraph as new inventions. Another experiment introduces a covert form of data poisoning, where non-identifying biographical details loosely associated with Adolf Hitler cause the model to emulate his personality and exhibit misaligned behavior.

The demonstrations, sparked by rising living costs and deep frustration with the Islamic Republic's leadership, spread rapidly across all 31 provinces, with protesters demanding regime change. Communications in Iran were largely shut down for five days, making independent verification difficult. Sources inside Iran told CBS News that medical and activist reports suggest mass killings, with hospitals pressured by security forces to identify injured protesters. While British officials have cited at least 2,000 deaths, foreign analysts and opposition groups estimate significantly higher numbers.

In response, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah B. Rogers warned that 'nothing is off the table' if the U.K. moves forward with a ban, signaling that Washington could retaliate to defend free speech principles. Rogers, a Trump administration appointee, has been outspoken against European measures regulating online speech and disinformation.

It identifies four pillars of this system — gerrymandering, voter suppression, media manipulation, and a captured judiciary — arguing that each now works systematically to entrench minority rule.

Gerrymandering gives Republicans roughly sixteen additional House seats and drastically reduces the number of competitive races. State-level restrictions on voter registration and access, especially those targeting young and Black voters, further suppress Democratic turnout. Meanwhile, conservative media control, especially through networks like Sinclair Broadcast Group, ensures millions of Americans remain misinformed or unaware of systemic bias.

The author highlights the Supreme Court's transformation as a central enabler of this imbalance.

The demonstration coincided with International Women’s Day and expressed widespread opposition to the rolling back of women’s rights achieved during the reign of the Shah. Women from diverse backgrounds—students, professionals, mothers, and activists—joined to defend their freedoms and demand equality under the new Islamic regime. Photographer Hengameh Golestan documented the historic protest, capturing images of women raising their arms and chanting in solidarity. 

Following the revolution, the newly established Islamic Republic repealed the 1967 Family Protection Law, restricted women from serving as judges, and imposed sex segregation in schools, sports, and public spaces.

Recently, the Pentagon secretly acquired a compact, backpack-sized device capable of emitting pulsed radio waves, which is now under analysis.

Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen have rejected these proposals, affirming the island’s loyalty to Denmark and warning that any U.S. move could threaten NATO unity. European allies, including France, Germany, and the UK, have supported Denmark and emphasized that Greenland’s future should be decided by Denmark and Greenland themselves.

Instead, the agency will account only for the costs incurred by businesses to comply with such standards. This change affects how the EPA conducts cost-benefit analyses for controlling fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone, both pollutants linked to respiratory diseases and tens of thousands of premature deaths annually in the United States. The agency justified its decision by citing 'uncertainties' in monetizing the public health benefits of cleaner air. Previously, these benefits had been central to regulatory justifications, with the EPA estimating in 2024 that stricter PM2.5 limits could prevent thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of lost workdays, offering health benefits worth dozens of times the compliance cost.

He also exaggerated claims about lowering prescription drug costs by hundreds of percent, which is mathematically impossible. Trump overstated US investment, economic growth, and gas prices, and misrepresented the impact of tariffs on China, Social Security taxation, and federal fraud on the budget deficit.

The group argues that this large-scale use of paid leave contradicts the Department of Government Efficiency’s stated goal of cutting waste, effectively paying workers not to work. PEER sent its findings to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), alleging that the extended paid leaves violated the 2016 Administrative Leave Act (ALA), which restricts such leave to ten workdays a year with limited exceptions.

According to PEER and legal experts, the administration bypassed these legal limits by creating new categories of paid leave that sidestepped the ALA’s rules, potentially breaching both that Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prevents federal funds from being used for unauthorized purposes.

When Times reporter Katie Rogers reminded him of the promise, Trump responded with surprise, asking, “When did I do that?” He then referred to a separate initiative—$1,776 'warrior dividend' checks previously distributed to military personnel. However, Defense One later revealed that those funds were not derived from tariff revenues, but rather from Congressional allocations for housing allowances. Trump's top economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, told CBS News that the president still intends to propose the $2,000 checks, though such payments would require congressional approval and proper appropriation of funds. Hassett warned that, while tariff revenue might partially support the idea, it is ultimately up to Congress to authorize any spending. The plan’s viability thus remains uncertain.

The PSLV-DL rocket lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre carrying 16 satellites, but during the third stage, the vehicle began tumbling uncontrollably. The malfunction led to the loss of all payloads, which reentered the atmosphere over the southern Indian Ocean. This marks the second consecutive PSLV failure, following the unsuccessful PSLV-C61 mission in May 2025, also caused by an issue in the solid-fueled third stage (PS3). Despite previous design reviews and reinforced quality checks, the recurrence of the same problem suggests a deeper structural flaw, possibly a nozzle perforation that induced loss of thrust and spin instability.

State media reported massive turnouts in major cities including Tehran, Isfahan, and Mashhad, where participants waved Iranian flags, carried portraits of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and chanted slogans supporting national unity and sovereignty. The rallies were organized in response to sporadic protests and violent clashes that erupted earlier, which Iranian officials attribute to external interference by hostile nations seeking to destabilize the Islamic Republic. Authorities claim the riots, concentrated in urban areas, involved a small minority manipulated by Western intelligence agencies and Israel, with evidence of coordinated social media campaigns amplifying discord. Security forces have arrested hundreds suspected of sabotage, including individuals linked to explosives and vandalism.

Best known for his work with *Esquire* magazine during the 1940s and 1950s, Moore gained prominence after being selected in 1946 to succeed Alberto Vargas—the celebrated creator of the 'Varga Girl.' In this new role, Moore developed the 'Esquire Girl,' whose wholesome beauty and confident charm resonated with postwar audiences. His artwork for the 1949 and 1950 *Esquire* calendars, which he painted entirely himself, became some of the most collected pin-up imagery of the decade. 

Born in Illinois, Moore led a varied life before becoming a recognized artist. A former football player for Northwestern University and the Chicago Bears, he later studied at the Chicago Art Institute and established his own studio in New York in the late 1930s. His early clients spanned diverse industries—from textiles to automobiles—and included major bran]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-artistic-legacy-of-al-moore-esquire-s-iconic-1950-pin-up-calendar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-artistic-legacy-of-al-moore-esquire-s-iconic-1950-pin-up-calendar</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia executed 356 people in 2025 amid intensified anti-drug campaign]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2025, Saudi Arabia set a new record for executions, putting 356 people to death according to an Agence France-Presse tally, surpassing the 338 executions recorded in 2024. The surge in capital punishment is closely linked to Riyadh’s ongoing “war on drugs,” a campaign that began several years ago and now sees many of those arrested at its outset facing execution after legal proceedings and convictions. Government data confirmed that 243 of those executed last year were convicted of drug-related crimes, representing a substantial majority of the total. This escalation has drawn condemnation from human rights activists who question the credibility of Saudi Arabia’s stated efforts to reform its justice and human rights practices. Duaa Dhainy, a researcher with the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, described the figures as evidence that promises of human rights progress in the kingdom are meaningless.

This measure, though severe, is described as part of Iran’s strategy to maintain sovereignty over its digital infrastructure. The report argues that such 'internet blackouts' are increasingly common worldwide, recalling incidents of partial outages in other regions, such as the Iberian Peninsula in 2025. According to the piece, while most modern societies heavily depend on the internet for survival, Iran is an exception thanks to decades of technological isolation that have driven the creation of internal alternatives. Central to this resilience is the “National Information Network,” a secure, government-controlled intranet that keeps administrative and banking services operating even without global connectivity.

According to the piece, Constellis, which evolved from Blackwater and its successor companies Xe Services and Academi, is now engaged in 'search and tracking' operations targeting 1.5 million undocumented immigrants. The author asserts that this contract represents a troubling expansion of private military involvement in domestic law enforcement, drawing parallels to Blackwater’s controversial role in conflicts abroad, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, and its history of human rights violations. The text further connects this development to previous cases where private security firms, like TigerSwan during the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, were allegedly used to surveil and suppress civilian demonstrations using counterinsurgency tactics.

Cuba urgently needs fuel because Venezuelan oil deliveries stopped after the recent ouster and U.S. capture of Nicolás Maduro, which also included U.S. interception of vessels carrying oil to Cuba. Mexico, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, was already supplying some oil before Maduro’s arrest and has since become a crucial fuel provider, with Sheinbaum framing the shipments as humanitarian aid. U.S. officials indicate that Washington does not intend to provoke a collapse of Cuba’s communist government but instead hopes to negotiate a transition away from authoritarianism, even as Trump publicly warns Havana to strike a deal “before it is too late.” Trump also amplified a post speculating that Secretar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-keeps-door-open-for-mexican-oil-shipments-to-crisis-hit-cuba-despite-trump-ultimatum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-keeps-door-open-for-mexican-oil-shipments-to-crisis-hit-cuba-despite-trump-ultimatum</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mike Pompeo comments on Iranian protests and Mossad involvement]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo posted a provocative message on X (formerly Twitter) wishing a Happy New Year to both Iranians protesting against their government and to Mossad agents allegedly supporting them. Pompeo’s post coincided with renewed anti-regime demonstrations spreading across multiple Iranian cities including Tehran, Mashhad, Zahedan, and Baluchistan. He suggested that the Islamic Republic was in serious trouble, claiming the government had resorted to using mercenaries as its 'last best hope.' Pompeo’s message implies a connection between Mossad operatives and the ongoing unrest, responding to earlier statements from the Israeli intelligence agency. Earlier in the week, Mossad had issued a Farsi-language social media post encouraging Iranians to take to the streets, stating that its operatives were assisting protesters both 'in the field' and not only 'from a distance.'

Soltani, a resident of Fardis near Tehran, was arrested on January 8, 2026, for participating in demonstrations calling for the removal of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. According to human rights organizations, he was tried without legal representation and denied access to counsel, raising serious concerns about due process. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported that Soltani’s family was only informed of his death sentence two days before the scheduled execution and granted a brief 10-minute visit. His sister, a lawyer, was barred from defending him or accessing his case documents.

According to bystander video, a passenger exited the car moments before it continued along the tracks near another train, avoiding a potentially serious accident. The passenger appeared uninjured. Andrew Maynard, a professor specializing in emerging technologies at Arizona State University, described the incident as a rare 'edge case'—an unusual situation where the vehicle’s artificial intelligence made a non-human-like decision. He explained that despite frequent software updates and the 29 cameras used in Waymo's cars, unforeseen conditions, such as recent construction and new rail lines in the area, can confuse navigation systems.

The conference was so well received that Tobalina was repeatedly invited back, eventually recording nearly 250 lectures that have collectively garnered hundreds of thousands of views online. The author views this as impressive proof that there remains a significant audience seeking cultural and intellectual enrichment rather than superficial entertainment.

The piece praises Tobalina’s mastery of her subject, her command of language, and her oratorical ability—all essential to transforming academic material into captivating storytelling.

During a meeting in Buenos Aires with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, Milei positioned Argentina as a pioneer alongside the United States in promoting this regional pact. Initial focus will be on countries like Uruguay, Panama, and Costa Rica, where joint projects are already under discussion. The accords also encourage partner nations to relocate their embassies to Jerusalem, designate groups like Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, and adjust anti-Israel stances at the United Nations.

According to a decree signed by the Ministry of the Interior, only 1,809 organizations are now authorized to continue operating in the country, including 1,684 local NGOs and 125 international entities. All other registered organizations have been removed from the official registry.

Authorities argue that the affected NGOs failed to submit mandatory accounting documents within the legally established deadlines, despite receiving several formal warnings. The government maintains that these organizations deliberately ignored official orders. This mass dissolution represents the final stage of a process that began roughly two months earlier, when the government suspended all NGOs that had not published their 2024 financial statements in the Official State Bulletin.

In Minneapolis, demonstrators clashed with heavily armed DHS agents as large-scale door-to-door raids began. Chemical spray was reportedly used, and several arrests were made.

La psicóloga no busca diagnosticar a Trump clínicamente, sino entender cómo un sistema político e institucional puede permitir que un líder actúe al margen del ridículo y de los límites habituales. La autora subraya que la peligrosidad de Trump no radica únicamente en su personalidad, sino en la capacidad de las instituciones para facilitar sus fantasías de omnipotencia. Su narcisismo y su comportamiento infantil funcionan como un dispositivo de seducción que disfraza la violencia política como espectáculo, haciendo que sus acciones reales sean mucho más peligrosas de lo que parecen. Roudinesco también analiza su entorno familiar y su relación con las mujeres, mostrando un patrón de objetivación y control, así como su fascinación por el poder, la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/elisabeth-roudinesco-analiza-el-impacto-del-narcisismo-de-trump-en-la-politica-estadounidense</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/elisabeth-roudinesco-analiza-el-impacto-del-narcisismo-de-trump-en-la-politica-estadounidense</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICE en Minneapolis: un año de operaciones migratorias controvertidas bajo la presidencia de Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante el primer año de la segunda presidencia de Donald Trump, el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE) ha intensificado sus operativos migratorios, desplegando miles de agentes federales en ciudades de mayoría latina, como Minneapolis. Los operativos incluyen detenciones masivas, perfilamiento racial y uso excesivo de la fuerza, que en algunos casos ha resultado en muertes de civiles. La administración Trump ha defendido las acciones del ICE argumentando que los agentes actúan dentro de la ley y con inmunidad, mientras que los residentes y autoridades locales denuncian una invasión federal que genera miedo y paraliza la vida diaria. La ciudad de Minneapolis, afectada por el despliegue de 3.000 agentes, ha visto cierres de negocios, cancelación de clases y manifestaciones diarias en rechazo a la presencia de la agencia.

La decisión se produce tras el anuncio del presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, de imponer aranceles a los países que envíen tropas a la isla, territorio autónomo dependiente de Dinamarca. Según fuentes oficiales del Ejército alemán, los soldados ya se encuentran de regreso a Copenhague, en una salida que, de acuerdo con el diario Bild, se realizó sin previo aviso.

Trump ha anunciado la aplicación de aranceles del 10% a partir de febrero y del 25% desde junio como medida de presión para avanzar en su objetivo declarado de lograr la “compra total” de Groenlandia.

Residentes y expertos denuncian que esta línea, marcada en algunos puntos con barriles amarillos y bloques de hormigón, es ambigua, a veces invisible y en ocasiones está situada cientos de metros más adentro de lo acordado en el tratado, ampliando así el control israelí sobre territorio gazatí. Según el Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, de los 447 palestinos fallecidos hasta el martes, al menos 77 murieron por disparos israelíes cerca de esta línea, incluidos 62 que la cruzaron; entre las víctimas hay adolescentes y niños pequeños.

Además, se prevé que un tercio de estos conductores se jubilen en los próximos diez años, agravando la situación debido al progresivo envejecimiento del colectivo, concentrado mayoritariamente entre los 45 y 55 años.

Para abordar este problema, la asociación andaluza de transportistas USINTRA y la Fundación Campus de Córdoba han firmado un Protocolo de Colaboración con el Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social de Turquía.

Rufián utilizó sus redes sociales para cuestionar el significado político y moral de ese gesto, señalando que, aunque pueda resultar chocante o incluso ridículo, existen precedentes históricos similares.

En concreto, el diputado recordó el caso del escritor noruego Knut Hamsun, quien en 1942 entregó su Premio Nobel al dirigente nazi Joseph Goebbels, pese a que la Alemania nazi había invadido Noruega.

Fuentes calificó este consenso como un “mito fundacional” que, según él, sirve para impedir formas de nacionalismo excluyente y cohesionadas como la Alemania nazi, defendiendo una visión basada en el orgullo racial, nacional y religioso.

En el transcurso de la charla, Webbon afirmó que el cine y la cultura popular han exagerado deliberadamente la figura de Hitler para convertirlo en el mayor villano de la historia y llegó a sostener que las atrocidades del Holocausto “probablemente no fueron tan graves como nos han contado”, insinuando además que Hitler no tenía conocimiento directo de lo que ocur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-pastor-nacionalista-cristiano-y-un-influencer-neonazi-minimizan-el-holocausto-y-blanquean-el-fascismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-pastor-nacionalista-cristiano-y-un-influencer-neonazi-minimizan-el-holocausto-y-blanquean-el-fascismo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La fragmentación de viviendas dispara el alquiler por habitaciones y agrava la crisis habitacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La crisis de la vivienda en España ha entrado en una nueva fase marcada por la especulación habitación a habitación. Ante la escasez y los elevados precios de los pisos completos, muchos propietarios están optando por fragmentar las viviendas y alquilar cada habitación por separado, incluso eliminando espacios comunes como el salón o la cocina. Esta práctica, lejos del modelo tradicional de piso compartido, se ha convertido en una estrategia para maximizar beneficios en un mercado con una demanda desbordada.

Los datos reflejan la magnitud del problema: en el último año, la oferta de habitaciones ha aumentado un 25%, pero sus precios se han disparado un 43%. Actualmente, por cada habitación disponible hay 22 personas interesadas, y el precio medio supera ya los 500 euros mensuales, una cifra que hace una década equivalía al alquiler de un piso completo.

Trump condicionó la eliminación de estas medidas a un acuerdo para la 'compra total y completa' de Groenlandia. Tanto conservadores como socialistas europeos califican la actitud de Washington como una 'increíble afrenta' e 'imperialismo', y abogan por la unidad europea y medidas de protección. En contraste, el PP español, bajo el liderazgo de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, mantiene una postura de silencio e indefinición pública, evitando pronunciarse directamente sobre el asunto y esperando a la reunión con Pedro Sánchez para fijar posici]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ppe-pide-suspender-el-acuerdo-comercial-con-ee-uu-por-los-aranceles-de-trump-sobre-groenlandia-y-critica-la-indefinicion-del-pp-espanol</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ppe-pide-suspender-el-acuerdo-comercial-con-ee-uu-por-los-aranceles-de-trump-sobre-groenlandia-y-critica-la-indefinicion-del-pp-espanol</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Catalunya estudia limitar la compra de vivienda en zonas tensionadas solo a uso residencial]]></title><description><![CDATA[La crisis de acceso a la vivienda ha llevado a Catalunya a explorar medidas más allá de la regulación de los alquileres. Pablo Feu, profesor de la Universitat de Barcelona y miembro de la Cátedra Barcelona de Estudios de Vivienda, explica en esta entrevista la base jurídica y el alcance de una propuesta que plantea limitar la compra de viviendas en zonas tensionadas exclusivamente a personas que vayan a destinarlas a vivir en ellas.

Feu sostiene que la prohibición de la especulación inmobiliaria no es una idea novedosa, sino un mandato constitucional recogido en el artículo 47 de la Constitución, que obliga a todas las administraciones a impedir la especulación en materia de vivienda. Según el urbanista, el problema actual no reside en el pequeño propietario tradicional, sino en la entrada masiva de grandes fondos y dinámicas globales que han convertido la vivienda en un activo financiero altamente rentable, expulsando a amplias capas de la población del mercado.

En política exterior, Trump ha debilitado la alianza transatlántica, mostrando mayor afinidad con líderes como Putin, Xi Jinping, Orbán, Meloni o Milei, y ha amenazado con imponer aranceles a países europeos (incluida Dinamarca) si no aceptan su pretensión de anexionarse Groenlandia, territorio dependiente de un aliado OTAN, llegando incluso a no descartar el uso de la fuerza. Esta postura ha llevado a varios países europeos a enviar tropas a Groenlandia en respuesta. A nivel interno, se describe una represión creciente: indultos a participantes del asalto al Capitolio, persecución judicial selectiva contra rivales políticos, asesinatos por agentes del ICE calificados como excesivos, ataques a la prensa con insultos y amenazas de revocación de licencias, así co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primer-ano-de-trump-en-su-regreso-a-la-presidencia-tensiones-geopoliticas-internacionales-y-medidas-autoritarias-internas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primer-ano-de-trump-en-su-regreso-a-la-presidencia-tensiones-geopoliticas-internacionales-y-medidas-autoritarias-internas</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netanyahu critica la falta de coordinación en la Junta Ejecutiva propuesta por Trump para la posguerra en Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, ha expresado su rechazo a la composición de la Junta Ejecutiva anunciada por el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump para supervisar la gobernanza temporal de Gaza tras el fin del conflicto.

En una entrevista concedida a La Vanguardia, Sánchez ha afirmado que una acción unilateral estadounidense en la isla ártica convertiría a Vladímir Putin en 'el hombre más feliz del mundo', ya que, según su opinión, legitimaría la invasión rusa de Ucrania al cuestionar la integridad territorial de otros países de forma similar. Además, ha calificado esa hipotética anexión como 'la carta de defunción de la OTAN', al erosionar gravemente la credibilidad y unidad de la alianza atlántica.

Ante este escenario, Sánchez ha defendido la necesidad de que la Unión Europea avance hacia una auténtica defensa común, incluso sin alcanzar la unanimidad de los 27 Estados miembros, proponiendo que un grupo de países pueda liderar la integración en materia de fuerzas armadas y de una industria de defensa europea más robusta.

Según el autor, Trump ha intentado presentarse discursivamente como quien controla el destino político del país caribeño, llegando incluso a autoproclamarse “presidente interino” y a sugerir que Delcy Rodríguez gobierna gracias a su aval. 

El texto sostiene que esta narrativa carece de sustento real. Lejos de ser el resultado de una elección o de un plan cuidadosamente diseñado por Washington, el ascenso de Rodríguez habría sido una consecuencia imprevista del fracaso de la operación estadounidense. El objetivo estratégico, argumenta Serafino, no se limitaba a apartar a Maduro, sino a provocar un colapso institucional que facilitara un escenario de caos similar al de Irak tras 2003, permitiendo el control de recursos ener]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-limites-del-relato-de-trump-sobre-un-supuesto-control-de-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-limites-del-relato-de-trump-sobre-un-supuesto-control-de-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘La idea más tonta de todos los tiempos.’: Ex-embajador critica el último ‘proyecto de vanidad’ de Trump al intentar adquirir Groenlandia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra a un ex-embajador criticando duramente la idea de Donald Trump de intentar adquirir Groenlandia, calificándola como un 'proyecto de vanidad' y una idea absurda.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-idea-mas-tonta-de-todos-los-tiempos-ex-embajador-critica-el-ultimo-proyecto-de-vanidad-de-trump-al-intentar-adquirir-groenlandia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-idea-mas-tonta-de-todos-los-tiempos-ex-embajador-critica-el-ultimo-proyecto-de-vanidad-de-trump-al-intentar-adquirir-groenlandia</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CAS Space realiza con éxito el primer vuelo suborbital del cohete Lihong 1 y recupera su cápsula]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado 12 de enero de 2026, la empresa china CAS Space llevó a cabo con éxito el primer lanzamiento de su cohete suborbital Lihong 1 (denominado Y1) desde el polígono comercial Dongfeng, ubicado en el centro espacial de Jiuquan.

Ambientada en un Oslo futuro próximo, narra la historia de una joven arquitecta que, ante la imposibilidad de acceder a una vivienda digna por la escalada de precios inmobiliarios, termina viviendo en un aparcamiento subterráneo convertido en refugio comunitario. La trama combina sátira social con elementos distópicos, explorando la precariedad laboral en estudios de arquitectura, el sexismo, la presión comercial versus la vocación artística y la creciente desigualdad en el acceso a la vivienda.

En la entrevista a los guionistas Nora Landsrød y Kristian Kilde, se destaca que la idea surgió de experiencias personales reales, como la frustración de solo poder permitirse una plaza de garaje en el mercado inmobiliario.

En la ciudad principal, Petropávlovsk de Kamchatka, con unos 160.000 habitantes, las acumulaciones han alcanzado hasta dos o tres metros de altura en algunas calles, sepultando viviendas, bloqueando accesos a edificios y provocando el colapso de tejados por el peso de la nieve.

Como consecuencia, dos hombres han fallecido: un hombre de 60 años fue encontrado bajo un alud de nieve desprendido de un tejado mientras se limpiaba un patio, y otro residente murió en circunstancias similares al quedar atrapado por la nieve caída de otro tejado. Ante esta situación, el gobernador regional, Yevgueni Beliáev, decretó el estado de emergencia el viernes 16 de enero, con el objetivo de movilizar recursos adicionales para la limpieza y recuperación.

En 1940, se estimaban unas 20.000 personas sin hogar en la capital. En marzo de 1941, se inauguró un albergue provisional para mendigos en las naves del Matadero municipal (hoy espacio cultural), con capacidad para 3.000 personas, adaptadas en solo 20 días a partir de cuadras para ganado. Las condiciones eran inhumanas: dormían sobre paja, sin colchones ni ropa adecuada, enfrentando temperaturas medias de 6 grados y un duro invierno. La mayoría no eran mendigos profesionales, sino personas empobrecidas por la guerra, la destrucción de viviendas, epidemias y la represión contra quienes habían apoyado a la República.

Durante décadas, Nielsen fue un actor dramático de presencia hierática, voz profunda y físico de galán clásico, habitual en series y películas de los años cincuenta a setenta, como Planeta prohibido o La aventura del Poseidón. Trabajó sin descanso, pero sin destacar especialmente en una industria saturada de intérpretes similares.

Todo cambió cuando ya había superado los cincuenta años y fue elegido por el trío Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker para Aterriza como puedas.

A partir de esas imágenes, algunos usuarios y comentaristas en redes han especulado con que el expresidente se quedó dormido y se tiró un pedo en ese contexto, basándose en reacciones faciales de las menores y en interpretaciones subjetivas del momento.

El propio artículo reconoce que no existe ninguna prueba objetiva que confirme lo sucedido y adopta un tono claramente irónico, señalando que no es posible verificar los hechos y que todo queda en el terreno de la interpretación personal del espectador. Para reforzar la especulación, se citan tuits y mensajes virales que aseguran que algo incómodo ocurrió, así como comentarios de cuentas activistas y satíricas.

Según un borrador de estatutos filtrado y visto por Bloomberg, Trump actuaría como presidente inaugural de la junta y tendría la autoridad para decidir qué países son invitados a participar como miembros.

En primer lugar, un cohete Larga Marcha 3B/E despegó desde Xichang a las 04:08 UTC del 16 de enero llevando el satélite Shijian 32 (probablemente militar y destinado a órbita geoestacionaria), pero sufrió un fallo en la tercera etapa criogénica, perdiéndose la misión. Este incidente rompe la racha perfecta de 69 lanzamientos exitosos del Larga Marcha en todo 2025.

Horas después, el cohete Ceres 2 de la empresa privada Galactic Energy realizó su vuelo inaugural desde Jiuquan, también a las 04:08 UTC, pero no logró alcanzar órbita.

Aunque su vida media en la atmósfera es más corta, su impacto a corto plazo lo convierte en un acelerador crítico del calentamiento global. Las emisiones de metano provienen tanto de fuentes naturales como de actividades humanas. Aproximadamente un 40% del metano atmosférico procede de fuentes naturales como humedales y procesos geológicos, mientras que el 60% restante tiene origen humano, principalmente en la agroganadería, la producción de arroz, la explotación de combustibles fósiles y la gestión de residuos. La ganadería de rumiantes genera metano por la digestión y la gestión del estiércol, mientras que el arroz produce emisiones significativas en campos inundados.

Macron ha declarado que estas amenazas arancelarias «son inaceptables y no tienen cabida en este contexto», y ha asegurado que los europeos responderán «de manera unida y coordinada» si se confirman las medidas, defendiendo así la soberanía europea. El mandatario francés ha enfatizado que ninguna intimidación influirá en las posiciones de Europa respecto a Groenlandia, Ucrania u otros asuntos globales.

Entre las medidas más destacadas se encuentra la regulación del comportamiento de los pasajeros en el transporte público, tanto en autobuses urbanos como en taxis.

La ordenanza establece sanciones de hasta 200 euros para quienes escuchen música, vídeos o audios en el teléfono móvil sin auriculares o mediante altavoces portátiles. El objetivo de esta medida es mejorar la convivencia, reducir molestias entre los usuarios y garantizar un entorno más respetuoso, tanto para los pasajeros como para los conductores. Las mismas normas se aplicarán en el autobús y en el taxi, equiparando por primera vez ambos servicios en este tipo de conductas.

Quiles la esperaba en la salida de empleados, intentando acceder al recinto de seguridad para grabarla. Posteriormente, se subió a un Mercedes y la siguió durante aproximadamente 20 minutos por la autovía. Aunque en un momento pensaron haberlo despistado, Quiles apareció finalmente en la puerta de su casa, lo que obligó a intervenir a la Policía Nacional para identificarlo y expulsarlo del lugar.

El acuerdo, valorado en aproximadamente 250 millones de dólares, fue adjudicado a Vitol, la mayor empresa independiente de comercio de petróleo del mundo. Un alto ejecutivo de Vitol, John Addison, estuvo directamente involucrado en la negociación del contrato y se reunió con Trump en la Casa Blanca días antes de la finalización del acuerdo. Addison donó alrededor de 6 millones de dólares a comités de acción política que respaldaron la reelección de Trump, incluyendo 5 millones a Maga Inc. en octubre de 2024. La Casa Blanca negó cualquier conflicto de intereses y defendió la operación como beneficiosa para los intereses estadounidenses, destacando que el crudo venezolano se vendió a precios un 30% superiores a los obtenidos previamente por el gobierno de Maduro.

Más allá de las anécdotas sobre la afición personal de Franco o su admiración por determinadas figuras del deporte, el texto se centra en cómo el régimen configuró un auténtico ecosistema de control a través del llamado «nacional-futbolismo». Desde la Guerra Civil, el franquismo militarizó y depuró las estructuras deportivas, utilizando el fútbol para cohesionar a la población y premiar o castigar territorios según su lealtad política. Clubes, federaciones y competiciones fueron reorganizados bajo criterios ideológicos, con una fuerte presencia de mandos militares y símbolos del nuevo régimen.

Tras el fracaso de una fascistización plena al estilo nazi o italiano, el fútbol evolucionó hacia una forma más sutil de propaganda.

Durante su discurso de aceptación, entregado por Juliette Binoche, Ullmann bromeó inicialmente sobre su avanzada edad al mencionar que sus temblores se debían a los años y no a los nervios.

Sin embargo, el momento más destacado llegó cuando abordó con ironía y crítica la actualidad política internacional. Sin nombrarlos directamente, se refirió al presidente estadounidense Donald Trump y a la opositora venezolana María Corina Machado, ganadora del Premio Nobel de la Paz 2025. Ullmann expresó su extrañeza por el hecho de que Machado haya entregado físicamente su medalla Nobel a Trump apenas días antes, en un gesto simbólico tras una reunión en la Casa Blanca.

El presidente del Consejo Europeo, António Costa, ha subrayado que la UE actuará con firmeza en defensa del derecho internacional y de la integridad territorial de los Estados miembros.

Según Miller, Dinamarca, por su reducido tamaño económico y militar, 'no puede defender ni controlar' Groenlandia, y argumentó que, según principios históricos de control territorial de los últimos 500 años, una nación debe ser capaz de defender, mejorar y habitar un territorio para mantener su soberanía. Esta declaración contradice directamente el derecho internacional moderno, que prohíbe el uso de la fuerza contra la soberanía territorial de otros estados (salvo en legítima defensa o con autorización del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU) y consagra el respeto a las fronteras desde el Tratado de Westfalia de 1648.

El tema, elegido como Canción del Día por Jenesaispop, parte de una anécdota real: una cita concertada por redes sociales que termina revelando una profunda contradicción ideológica. La letra narra cómo alguien acaba acostándose con una persona de derechas y reflexiona, entre ironía y autocrítica, sobre esa excepción a una norma personal que el propio artista resume con la frase final: «aunque pases una mala racha, nunca tires a un facha».

Musicalmente, la canción comienza de forma acústica y evoluciona hacia un sonido post-punk con un puente de tintes metaleros, reforzando su carga expresiva.

Según un sondeo de CNN realizado por SSRS, cerca del 60 % de la población considera que este primer año ha sido un fracaso, mientras que su índice general de aprobación se sitúa en el 39 %, nueve puntos menos que un año antes. Además, una mayoría cree que Trump ha abusado de su poder presidencial y que se ha centrado en prioridades equivocadas.

El desgaste no se limita a la valoración personal del presidente, sino que afecta también a políticas que históricamente le eran favorables. En el ámbito económico, el 55 % de los encuestados opina que Trump ha empeorado la situación económica del país, y solo un 36 % cree que ha actuado sobre los asuntos adecuados. La encuesta de Associated Press–NORC refuerza esta tendencia y muestra una caída notable incluso entre votantes republicanos: solo el 16 % ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-encuestas-reflejan-un-fuerte-deterioro-del-apoyo-a-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-encuestas-reflejan-un-fuerte-deterioro-del-apoyo-a-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG prepara un monitor ultrawide de 39 pulgadas con panel Tandem WOLED y resolución 5K2 (5120x2160) para el CES 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo del blog 'Al otro lado del mostrador' presenta un nuevo monitor LG de 39 pulgadas con tecnología Tandem WOLED que se espera sea mostrado en el CES 2026.

La tecnología Tandem WOLED mejora significativamente el brillo máximo, la duración del panel y la eficiencia energética en comparación con los OLED convencionales. Además, LG incorpora mejoras en la estructura de subpíxeles (pasando a un diseño Stripe que alinea los colores rojo, verde y azul en línea recta), lo que debería reducir los problemas habituales de reproducción de texto en pantallas OLED, ofreciendo mayor nitidez en interfaces y documentos.

El texto destaca que Trump no ha desvinculado sus negocios del cargo presidencial, a diferencia de otros mandatarios anteriores, y ha diversificado sus fuentes de ingresos de manera significativa. Entre los principales factores se encuentran el lanzamiento de criptomonedas como el 'memecoin' $TRUMP y $Melania, que han generado más de 1.000 millones, así como el valor de mercado de Truth Social (cerca de 2.000 millones), nuevas empresas como Trump Mobile y fusiones en energía nuclear.

El hecho resulta significativo no solo por la comparación entre un espacio informativo y unos dibujos animados, sino porque ambos canales pertenecen al mismo grupo, Mediaset.

En términos generales, Doraemon alcanzó un 8,4% de cuota de pantalla y 151.000 espectadores, frente al 6,9% y 117.000 que obtuvo La Mirada Crítica.

El animal fue localizado atado, con las patas inmovilizadas mediante bridas de plástico y el hocico rodeado de cinta aislante, unas condiciones claramente incompatibles con su bienestar y que suponían un grave riesgo para su vida.

El hallazgo se produjo durante un servicio ordinario de vigilancia, cuando los agentes detectaron al perro en un estado que requería una intervención inmediata. Ante la gravedad de los hechos, se activó el protocolo correspondiente para garantizar la seguridad del animal y se solicitó la intervención de los servicios especializados.

Estas medidas se mantendrán hasta que se alcance un acuerdo para la 'compra completa y total' de Groenlandia.

Esta cifra supone un fuerte incremento respecto a 2021, cuando la mediana se situaba en 45 años, y contrasta de forma aún más llamativa con los datos de 1981, cuando la edad media de compra era de apenas 31 años. El principal factor que explica este cambio es la combinación de precios de la vivienda cada vez más elevados y tipos hipotecarios altos, que han dificultado el acceso a la propiedad para las generaciones más jóvenes.

El análisis de Apollo muestra cómo el mercado inmobiliario se ha ido desplazando progresivamente hacia compradores de mayor edad, con más ahorro acumulado y mayor capacidad para afrontar las condiciones financieras actuales. Mientras tanto, muchos jóvenes se ven obligados a retrasar la compra de su primera vivienda o directamente a permanecer en el mercado del alquiler durante más]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encarecimiento-de-la-vivienda-eleva-a-56-anos-la-edad-media-de-quienes-compran-casa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encarecimiento-de-la-vivienda-eleva-a-56-anos-la-edad-media-de-quienes-compran-casa</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 20:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Testimonio de Stella Calloni sobre la invasión estadounidense a Panamá en 1989]]></title><description><![CDATA[La periodista Stella Calloni, reconocida por su trayectoria en periodismo de investigación, relata en primera persona los eventos ocurridos durante la invasión estadounidense a Panamá el 20 de diciembre de 1989. La operación, ordenada por el presidente George H. Bush, buscaba capturar al general Manuel Noriega y asegurar el control del canal de Panamá. Calloni contextualiza la situación política y geopolítica de la época: Noriega, que inicialmente había colaborado con la CIA por encargo de Omar Torrijos, se convirtió en un enemigo del imperialismo tras participar en la XVII Conferencia de Ejércitos Americanos en 1987, donde Estados Unidos promovía la equivalencia entre nacionalismo iberoamericano y comunismo. Según Calloni, Noriega advirtió a grupos argentinos y cubanos sobre estas tensiones, lo que provocó que Bush lo considerara un traidor.

Se trata de una práctica mediante la cual algunos padres adoptivos, tras haber adoptado legalmente a un menor (muchas veces con necesidades especiales o procedentes de adopciones internacionales), deciden transferir su custodia a otras personas sin apenas supervisión oficial. En la mayoría de los estados basta con un documento firmado ante un abogado para llevar a cabo esta transferencia, lo que puede derivar en situaciones muy peligrosas.

El reportaje destaca que una cuarta parte de los niños adoptados terminan siendo abandonados nuevamente por sus familias adoptivas, cifrando en alrededor de 25.000 los menores afectados cada año. Estos niños, que a menudo pasan por varias familias (algunos hasta tres o cuatro), son conocidos con el término sensacionalista ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fenomeno-del-rehoming-en-las-adopciones-en-estados-unidos-la-reubicacion-informal-de-menores-adoptados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fenomeno-del-rehoming-en-las-adopciones-en-estados-unidos-la-reubicacion-informal-de-menores-adoptados</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 20:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La expansión de asentamientos israelíes en Cisjordania alcanza niveles récord bajo el actual gobierno ultraderechista]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza cómo el movimiento colono israelí vive un momento de gran auge en Cisjordania ocupada, impulsado por la llegada al poder de figuras ultraderechistas como Itamar Ben Gvir y Bezalel Smotrich.

Aunque la ley israelí considera ilegales estos puestos iniciales, el Ejército coopera activamente y el Estado los acaba legalizando.

Según Newsom, la respuesta del presidente a estas protestas no ha contribuido a rebajar la tensión, sino todo lo contrario. El gobernador californiano afirmó que Trump está “intentando avivar una guerra civil” y calificó de “vergonzosa” su actuación, especialmente en relación con los disturbios y manifestaciones en Minneapolis.

Se centra en su novela 'Exilio interior', escrita en 1961 durante su exilio en Francia tras las protestas estudiantiles de 1956 en España. La obra, considerada un referente underground de la literatura antifranquista, combina elementos de novela picaresca y realismo social con humor negro, narrada desde la perspectiva de un niño que muestra la represión, el hambre, la corrupción del régimen y el papel de la Iglesia nacionalcatólica en la posguerra. Juana recuerda cómo la leyó de niña y el impacto que le causó. El libro tardó décadas en publicarse en España (hasta 1988) pese a su éxito internacional, y ha sido reeditado en 2025 por Hoja de Lata.

Jørgensen subrayó que, en muchos países de la UE, la factura eléctrica incorpora numerosos impuestos, cánones y conceptos que no están directamente relacionados con el consumo de energía, lo que encarece el recibo final para los consumidores.

Desde octubre de 2023, especialmente en Berlín, se han abierto más de 12.000 procesos penales contra participantes en manifestaciones pacíficas, con detenciones policiales frecuentes y condenas judiciales por supuestos delitos de antisemitismo o incitación al odio. Se critica la criminalización de lemas como 'Desde el río hasta el mar, Palestina vencerá' o gestos como el puño cerrado, atribuyéndolos erróneamente a organizaciones terroristas, lo que lleva a prejuicios policiales y decisiones judiciales acríticas.

El autor argumenta que esta persecución confunde la legítima crítica política al Estado de Israel y su política de ocupación, asentamientos ilegales y presuntos crímenes internacionales (incluyendo riesgo de genocidio según ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-juridico-sobre-la-represion-policial-y-judicial-a-activistas-propalestinos-en-alemania-desde-octubre-de-2023</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-juridico-sobre-la-represion-policial-y-judicial-a-activistas-propalestinos-en-alemania-desde-octubre-de-2023</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ADIF registra 4.474 robos de conductores eléctricos entre 2014 y 2025, con notable descenso tras la pandemia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias (ADIF) ha contabilizado un total de 4.474 incidentes de sustracción de conductores eléctricos en el periodo comprendido entre 2014 y mayo de 2025, según datos facilitados por la entidad pública a través del Portal de Transparencia. Los años con mayor incidencia fueron 2014 (1.072 casos) y 2015 (860), seguidos de una marcada disminución a partir de 2016, llegando al mínimo histórico en 2020 con solo 121 robos, atribuido a las restricciones de movilidad por la pandemia. A partir de 2021 se observa un repunte, con cifras que oscilan entre los 279 y los 391 incidentes anuales hasta 2024, y 134 registrados en 2025 hasta la fecha de la respuesta. A pesar de este incremento pospandemia, los valores actuales siguen siendo considerablemente inferiores a los de la etapa 2014-2018.

Según explicó el propio Varoufakis en un vídeo publicado en la red social X, dos agentes se presentaron en su domicilio para entregarle una citación oficial en la que se le ordena comparecer ante la sede policial para ser interrogado por la brigada antidroga, no como testigo, sino en calidad de acusado.

Los hechos que han motivado esta actuación policial se remontan a una entrevista grabada poco después de Año Nuevo, en la que Varoufakis abordó cuestiones como el futuro laboral de la juventud, el impacto de las redes sociales y el sentido de la vida. En ese contexto, admitió haber consumido drogas en el pasado, concretamente marihuana y una única experiencia con éxtasis en Sídney hace 36 años.

La agencia ha reclutado al menos 12.000 nuevos agentes en un solo año mediante procesos acelerados que priorizan la 'valentía' sobre la experiencia, ofreciendo primas de hasta 50.000 dólares. Actualmente, los agentes recién incorporados superan en número a los veteranos, y la formación se limita a un curso online de cuatro semanas y otro presencial de ocho semanas.

Esta rápida militarización ha coincidido con un aumento significativo de la violencia: desde enero de 2026 se han registrado al menos 16 tiroteos con participación de agentes migratorios, cinco de ellos mortales, y más de 30 fallecidos en centros de detención. Un caso destacado es el asesinato de Renee Good, ciudadana estadounidense de 37 años, tiroteada por el agente Jonathan Ross —uno de los más experimentados— durante un operativo en Minneapolis.

PACMA recuerda casos como el de Villavieja de Lozoya, donde estas actividades se realizaban ante audiencia, y denuncia que la administración madrileña no actuó pese a las denuncias.

A partir de casos contemporáneos como el de Harvey Weinstein, el texto se adentra en una figura histórica especialmente controvertida: el escritor noruego Knut Hamsun, premio Nobel de Literatura y ferviente simpatizante del nazismo, que llegó a regalar su medalla del Nobel a Joseph Goebbels y a escribir un elogio de Adolf Hitler tras su muerte.

Durante la posguerra, Hamsun pasó de ser un símbolo nacional en Noruega a convertirse en una vergüenza colectiva. Muchos ciudadanos expresaron su rechazo devolviéndole sus libros, arrojándolos a su casa como gesto simbólico.

Estas condiciones excluyen a las personas en situación administrativa irregular. 

La única excepción contemplada en la normativa se aplica a extranjeros refugiados, solicitantes de asilo en trámite o aquellos con autorización de estancia por razones humanitarias, siempre que no tengan acceso a otras prestaciones similares.

Málaga ha sido escenario en los últimos meses de múltiples movilizaciones ciudadanas en favor del fin de la violencia en Gaza y del respeto al derecho internacional humanitario.

Su activismo también se refleja en la solidaridad con Palestina, que ha llevado a la detención de Mo Chara, el miembro más visible de la banda, mostrando cómo opinar puede ser considerado provocación en ciertos contextos del Reino Unido. El vínculo con el fútbol aparece como una extensión natural de su mensaje, ya que las camisetas y cánticos se convierten en símbolos de identidad, memoria y pertenencia cultural.

Inicialmente confiaba en que Trump facilitaría la regularización de cubanos en su situación, pero considera que las medidas migratorias de la administración han endurecido su limbo legal, dejándole en incertidumbre junto a otros cientos de miles de compatriotas en idéntica posición.

Aunque en 2024 se iniciaron algo más de 11.500 viviendas protegidas (un 6 % menos que el año anterior), los datos preliminares de 2025 indican una nueva reducción en el ritmo de construcción, muy lejos de cubrir la elevada demanda existente.

El principal obstáculo señalado por el sector es la baja rentabilidad: los precios máximos establecidos para garantizar la asequibilidad reducen el margen de beneficio a niveles muy bajos (alrededor del 1 %), lo que desincentiva a las promotoras frente a proyectos de vivienda libre más lucrativos. Además, los costes de construcción disparados incrementan el riesgo de pérdidas.

Otro cuello de botella clave es la escasez y lentitud en la disponibilidad de suelo apto, mayoritariamente en manos de administraciones públicas pero con trámites paralizados.

Según el escrito de acusación provisional del Ministerio Fiscal, los hechos ocurrieron en el propio domicilio que compartían, donde el acusado residía como casero y la víctima como arrendataria.

De acuerdo con la versión de la Fiscalía, la mujer se encontraba comiendo en el salón cuando el acusado se aproximó de forma inesperada y comenzó a tocarle distintas partes del cuerpo, concretamente la espalda, el brazo y el cuello, con una clara intención de carácter sexual.

Según datos oficiales, entre 2002 y 2024, el 75% de los nuevos trabajadores incorporados al mercado laboral español eran extranjeros o tenían doble nacionalidad, lo que evidencia la fuerte dependencia de sectores como la hostelería, la construcción o la agricultura de la mano de obra migrante.

Expertos como Claudia Finotelli subrayan que España ha desarrollado un enfoque pragmático, centrado menos en la situación administrativa inicial de los migrantes y más en ofrecer vías progresivas de regularización. A lo largo de las últimas dos décadas, las reformas han ampliado el acceso a permisos de residencia y trabajo, la reagrupación familiar, los visados de búsqueda de empleo y los programas socioeducativos, además de refor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-migratorio-de-espana-regularizacion-mercado-laboral-y-retos-de-sostenibilidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-migratorio-de-espana-regularizacion-mercado-laboral-y-retos-de-sostenibilidad</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 10:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[FACUA denuncia a Live Nation por cobrar hasta 66 euros en gastos de gestión y aplicar precios dinámicos en entradas de Rosalía]]></title><description><![CDATA[La asociación FACUA-Consumidores en Acción ha presentado una denuncia ante el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030 contra Live Nation, promotora de los conciertos de Rosalía en Madrid y Barcelona. La organización critica el cobro de gastos de gestión que oscilan entre 6 y 66 euros por entrada, considerándolos abusivos ya que forman parte de los costes operativos habituales de la empresa y no corresponden a un servicio adicional solicitado por el usuario. Además, se denuncia la aplicación de precios dinámicos en las entradas denominadas 'Platinum', cuyo precio varía según la oferta y la demanda, generando incertidumbre y sobrecostes imprevisibles.

El artículo también recoge testimonios de usuarias afectadas por prácticas similares en la preventa de entradas para Bruno Mars en Ticketmaster, donde los gastos de gestión llegaron a duplicar el precio inicial de las entradas (por ejemplo, de unos 500 euros a 1.200 euros para cuatro localidades).

Cooper rechazó las sugerencias de líderes parisinos y romanos que abogan por retomar el diálogo con Putin como parte de los esfuerzos para alcanzar un acuerdo. Según la responsable británica, el centro de la actividad diplomática actual se encuentra en Ucrania, junto con Estados Unidos y el apoyo europeo, que están elaborando planes de paz que incluyen garantías de seguridad.

Ayuso fue una de las primeras figuras políticas en pronunciarse sobre el caso, utilizando su perfil oficial en la red social X para cuestionar la denuncia y enmarcarla en un discurso político más amplio.

El arresto se llevó a cabo gracias a la colaboración internacional del FBI y diversas autoridades centroamericanas, tras seguir un complejo itinerario que incluyó Guatemala, Honduras y finalmente Nicaragua, donde fue localizado y detenido por encontrarse en situación irregular en el país.

Herrera Guerrero está acusado de delitos graves como corrupción de menores y extorsión, liderando presuntamente una red dedicada a chantajear a personas de la alta sociedad mediante la amenaza de difundir imágenes de supuestas relaciones con menores.

Estas declaraciones se producen en medio de renovadas tensiones derivadas de las reiteradas afirmaciones del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump sobre la necesidad de que Estados Unidos adquiera o controle Groenlandia por motivos de seguridad nacional, sin descartar opciones militares.

El año comenzó con la habitual calma postnavideña, pero estuvo marcado profundamente por el impacto de la inteligencia artificial en el negocio. Por un lado, las visitas al blog cayeron drásticamente (hasta un 80 %) debido a las respuestas generadas por IA en buscadores que apenas enlazan a fuentes originales; sin embargo, las ventas de hardware repuntaron notablemente gracias a la demanda de potentes estaciones de trabajo y PCs orientados a ejecutar modelos de IA en local, llegando a montar más de una docena de equipos de alto rendimiento.

Se intentó lanzar una sección específica de la tienda dedicada a hardware para IA, pero la fuerte crisis de precios y escasez de memoria RAM y discos duros (con subidas de cientos de euros en configuraciones de 128 GB en pocos meses) obligó a congelar el proyecto.

Los resultados, basados en mediciones objetivas mediante acelerómetros (en lugar de autoinformes), indican que añadir solo cinco minutos diarios de actividad física de intensidad moderada a vigorosa (como caminar rápido) podría prevenir hasta un 10 % de las muertes en el conjunto de la población adulta si la mayoría lo adoptara. Entre las personas más inactivas, este beneficio individual sería aún mayor.

En Pompeya, el Lupanar destaca por sus grafitis explícitos que revelan nombres, precios, alardes sexuales y hasta comentarios políticos, mostrando un ambiente donde soldados, funcionarios y esclavos compartían información sin filtros. La Subura, barrio marginal cercano al Foro, era un cruce de senadores arruinados, prostitutas y aspirantes a políticos donde circulaban rumores sobre sobornos y alianzas.

Aunque los informes médicos apuntan a que recibió cuatro disparos y los vídeos grabados por testigos muestran que trataba de huir sin atacar a nadie, las autoridades defendieron desde el primer momento una versión basada en la autodefensa.

La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, acusó a Good de “usar su vehículo como arma”, mientras Donald Trump afirmó que había atropellado violentamente al agente que la mató.

La sentencia estaba prevista para finales de enero de 2026 y la fiscalía había solicitado una pena de un año de prisión. El indulto extingue así la responsabilidad penal de la exmandataria antes de que se dictara condena definitiva.

Vázquez, que gobernó Puerto Rico entre 2019 y 2021, fue arrestada en 2022 acusada de participar en un esquema de sobornos y fraude para favorecer su campaña de 2020. Según la acusación, aceptó donaciones valoradas en hasta 25.000 dólares procedentes del banquero venezolano Julio Herrera Velutini, con el apoyo del exagente del FBI Mark Rossini. A cambio, los donantes buscaban que la entonces gobernadora destituyera al comisionado de la Oficina de Instituciones Financieras, que investigaba un banco propiedad de Herre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-concede-el-indulto-a-la-exgobernadora-de-puerto-rico-wanda-vazquez-tras-declararse-culpable-por-corrupcion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-concede-el-indulto-a-la-exgobernadora-de-puerto-rico-wanda-vazquez-tras-declararse-culpable-por-corrupcion</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Justicia griega absuelve a 24 cooperantes acusados por rescatar a personas migrantes en el mar Egeo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un tribunal griego en la isla de Lesbos ha absuelto a 24 trabajadores humanitarios que durante años fueron acusados de delitos graves por su participación en tareas de rescate de personas migrantes en el mar Egeo. Entre los absueltos se encuentran la activista siria Sarah Mardini y el voluntario germano-irlandés Seán Binder, que formaban parte de la ONG Emergency Response Centre International (ERCI). La sentencia pone fin a un largo proceso judicial iniciado hace siete años, en el que los acusados se enfrentaban a penas de hasta veinte años de prisión por presunta facilitación de entrada irregular, pertenencia a organización criminal y blanqueo de capitales.

Los hechos se remontan al periodo comprendido entre 2015 y 2018, uno de los momentos más críticos de la llamada crisis de refugiados en Europa.

Este diseño, caracterizado por copas cónicas rígidas y puntiagudas con costuras en espiral o círculos concéntricos, buscaba exagerar y proyectar el busto para lograr la silueta de reloj de arena ideal de la época: cintura estrecha y pecho muy definido. Aunque resultaba incómodo por sus materiales rígidos y la ausencia de comodidad moderna, su objetivo era puramente estético y visual, complementando prendas ajustadas como jerséis ceñidos, blusas entalladas y vestidos de corte estructurado que dejaban ver claramente su forma característica.

La petición se produce tras un tuit de Ayuso en el que, al rechazar retirar honores al artista, afirmaba que las mujeres violadas estaban en Irán, obviando la existencia de víctimas de violencia sexual en la propia región.

El caso de Julio Iglesias, denunciado por dos extrabajadoras de sus propiedades en Punta Cana, ha generado un fuerte debate político en Madrid.

Esta especie, la mayor limícola de Galicia, destaca por su enorme pico curvo, el más largo de la avifauna nacional en proporción, que utiliza para buscar alimento en el fango.

A través del testimonio de Cristina, limpiadora con estudios universitarios, se pone el foco en las condiciones abusivas que muchas trabajadoras soportan a diario, como la falta de pausas, la vigilancia constante o exigencias humillantes por parte de algunos empleadores.

Cristina explica que, pese a su formación académica, ejerce como limpiadora por decisión propia, reivindicando la dignidad del oficio y denunciando los prejuicios sociales que lo rodean. En sus redes sociales se ha convertido en una voz visible que rompe el silencio de un sector donde los abusos están normalizados.

Se trata de una copia adaptada de un famoso grabado del alemán Martin Schongauer que representa al santo asediado por demonios en el desierto. Aunque durante siglos su autoría fue dudosa y se atribuyó al taller de Domenico Ghirlandaio o a otros artistas, en 2008, tras su venta en Sotheby's y un exhaustivo examen y limpieza en el Metropolitan Museum of Art de Nueva York, se revelaron características estilísticas propias de Miguel Ángel: una paleta de colores específica, sombreados cruzados característicos y pentimenti (correcciones visibles bajo infrarrojos) que indican creación original y no mera copia.

Frente al protagonismo casi absoluto que los medios conceden a líderes políticos y militares de edad avanzada —figuras como Donald Trump, Benjamín Netanyahu, Vladímir Putin, Ali Jamenei o Xi Jinping—, el autor cuestiona los motivos reales por los que se les otorga tanta atención. Sus voces, omnipresentes en informativos y debates, generan miedo, tensión y una sensación constante de amenaza global. Se analizan sus palabras, silencios y gestos como si contuvieran verdades trascendentales, cuando en realidad su principal “mérito” es concentrar un poder destructivo sin precedentes: arsenales nucleares, ejércitos masivos y la capacidad de imponer relatos falsos como si fueran verdades incuestionables.

Según esta encuesta, realizada a casi 26.000 personas en 21 países, una mayoría creciente de ciudadanos cree que China será el país que más aumente su influencia global en la próxima década, mientras que Estados Unidos pierde atractivo y liderazgo internacional.

El estudio señala que las políticas de 'America First' impulsadas por Trump han acelerado este cambio de percepción. La imposición de aranceles tanto a aliados como a rivales, el cuestionamiento del sistema tradicional de alianzas liderado por Washington y una retórica abiertamente confrontacional han empujado a numerosos países a estrechar lazos con Pekín. Al mismo tiempo, adversarios históricos de Estados Unidos perciben ahora a Washington como menos temible, interpretando que la era de la hegemonía occidental sin rival ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-sondeo-global-muestra-que-las-politicas-de-trump-refuerzan-la-influencia-internacional-de-china</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-sondeo-global-muestra-que-las-politicas-de-trump-refuerzan-la-influencia-internacional-de-china</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tragedia en Pensilvania: Niño de 11 años asesina a su padre tras una disputa por un videojuego]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un terrible suceso ha conmocionado a Pensilvania, Estados Unidos, donde un niño de 11 años ha sido acusado de matar a su padre a tiros después de que este le retirara su Nintendo Switch.

Durante su intervención, Sánchez defendió la importancia de reforzar sectores estratégicos como la energía y la vivienda y anunció la creación de un nuevo fondo de inversión que recogerá el testigo de los fondos europeos Next Generation. En ese marco, el presidente subrayó también el papel de la clase trabajadora y, de forma explícita, el de las personas migrantes, afirmando que en España “no sobra nadie” y que, de hecho, el país necesita más mano de obra.

Estas declaraciones provocaron una rápida reacción del líder del Partido Popular, Alberto Núñez Feijóo. A través de un mensaje publicado en la red social X, Feijóo se centró en un breve fragmento del discurso de Sánchez para expresar una postura opuesta.

El estudio alerta de que unas 150.000 familias viven en viviendas inadecuadas, ya sea en chabolas, estructuras temporales o pisos que carecen de suministros básicos como agua corriente, electricidad, calefacción o sistemas adecuados de evacuación de aguas residuales. En términos poblacionales, esta realidad afecta a alrededor de 410.000 personas, lo que representa el 7,8 % de la población valenciana.

El informe pone de manifiesto que los problemas de vivienda van mucho más allá de los casos más extremos. Cerca de 1,2 millones de personas tienen dificultades relacionadas con el acceso y mantenimiento de su vivienda. Entre ellas, destaca el elevado número de hogares que no pueden afrontar gastos imprevistos, mantener una temperatura adecuada en casa o disponer de condiciones mínimas de salubridad e higiene.

Estos datos se publican pocas semanas después del mal resultado electoral del PSOE en Extremadura, donde el partido perdió diez escaños y más de 100.000 votos, registrando su peor resultado histórico en esa comunidad.

Pese a ese revés autonómico, el sondeo elaborado bajo la dirección de José Félix Tezanos indica que el impacto no se traslada al conjunto del electorado nacional. En comparación con el barómetro de diciembre, el PP recorta ligeramente la distancia con el PSOE —de nueve puntos a 8,7—, aunque sin alterar el liderazgo socialista. Vox se consolida como tercera fuerza con un 17,7% de los votos, seguido de Sumar (7,2%) y Podemos (3,5%), siendo estas dos últimas formaciones las únicas que empeoran sus resultados respecto al ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cis-de-enero-situa-al-psoe-en-cabeza-con-una-ventaja-de-casi-nueve-puntos-sobre-el-pp-pese-a-su-retroceso-en-extremadura</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cis-de-enero-situa-al-psoe-en-cabeza-con-una-ventaja-de-casi-nueve-puntos-sobre-el-pp-pese-a-su-retroceso-en-extremadura</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El origen y la explosión del término 'secanuca' en el fútbol argentino: del episodio con Tapia hasta el polémico título de Rosario Central]]></title><description><![CDATA[El término 'secanuca' surgió en la Copa América 2024, cuando un vídeo viral mostró a Luciano Nakis, prosecretario de la AFA, secándole el sudor de la nuca a Claudio 'Chiqui' Tapia durante un partido ante Canadá en condiciones de mucho calor y humedad. Este gesto se interpretó como un símbolo máximo de obsecuencia y servilismo hacia el poder, dando origen a la palabra 'secanuca' como sinónimo de persona sumisa ante la autoridad.

El vocablo se popularizó entre los aficionados y explotó a finales de 2025 tras una controvertida decisión de la AFA y la Liga Profesional. El 20 de noviembre de 2025, en una reunión del Comité Ejecutivo, se creó de forma improvisada el título de 'Campeón de Liga 2025' para reconocer al equipo con más puntos en la tabla anual: Rosario Central (con Ángel Di María como figura destacada).

Según el texto, esta operación no constituye una ayuda directa transparente, sino un mecanismo financiero complejo que traslada el coste real a los contribuyentes europeos a medio y largo plazo.

La autora recoge las valoraciones del ex militar noruego Dan-Viggo Bergtun, quien califica la medida como un “fraude financiero”. Bergtun sostiene que la UE se endeuda en los mercados a tipos de interés relativamente altos para, posteriormente, prestar ese dinero a Ucrania sin intereses, asumiendo la Unión las pérdidas anuales derivadas de esa diferencia. Dichas pérdidas, argumenta, acabarán imputándose durante años a los presupuestos europeos, que funcionan como garantía colectiva frente a los inversores.

Su argumento se basa en la necesidad de asegurar Groenlandia para la 'seguridad nacional' de Estados Unidos. Esta escalada de tensiones se produce tras una reciente reunión en la Casa Blanca entre Trump y altos funcionarios daneses y groenlandeses, quienes rechazaron frontalmente sus ambiciones imperialistas.

Guthrie vivió en el complejo de apartamentos Beach Haven, en Brooklyn, propiedad de Fred Trump, y denunció en sus letras cómo este empresario establecía una 'línea de color' que impedía el acceso a personas negras, fomentando el odio racial para beneficio propio.

Los hechos se produjeron el pasado 8 de enero y, según la investigación, no se trataron de un ataque aislado, sino del desenlace de varios días de acoso previo a través de redes sociales.

De acuerdo con el testimonio de la víctima, desde días antes del secuestro venía recibiendo amenazas e insultos por parte de personas vinculadas al entorno de las agresoras, que la acusaban de haber mantenido una relación con el marido de una de ellas. La joven rechaza categóricamente dicha acusación.

Los manifestantes portaron fotos de Maduro y de figuras históricas del chavismo, denunciaron la intervención extranjera y reclamaron el respeto a la autodeterminación del país.

Esta medida, en vigor desde la reforma de la ley del aborto de 2023, tiene como objetivo permitir a los centros públicos organizar adecuadamente sus recursos humanos y garantizar que la interrupción voluntaria del embarazo pueda realizarse dentro de la sanidad pública.

El departamento dirigido por Mónica García ya había advertido en noviembre de 2025 que acudiría a los tribunales si la Comunidad de Madrid persistía en su negativa. Pese a ello, el Ejecutivo madrileño ha rechazado reiteradamente implantar el registro, argumentando que supone una forma de 'señalar' o 'estigmatizar' a los médicos.

Medios de comunicación, analistas políticos y representantes de partidos de todo el espectro ideológico han calificado el gesto de inapropiado, irrespetuoso y perjudicial para el prestigio del premio.

Machado realizó la entrega durante una visita a la Casa Blanca, argumentando que se trataba de un reconocimiento a la implicación de Trump en la causa de la democracia venezolana. El expresidente estadounidense recibió la medalla —forjada en oro y entregada a los galardonados— como un gesto simbólico que calificó de “maravilloso”, y la Casa Blanca difundió imágenes del encuentro.

Según los datos presentados por el Ministerio de Sanidad, durante el pasado año se realizaron 6.335 trasplantes, una cifra muy cercana a la alcanzada en 2024, cuando se batió el máximo histórico con 6.464 intervenciones. En la última década, la actividad trasplantadora ha aumentado más de un 50%, lo que refleja la solidez y la capacidad de coordinación del sistema sanitario español.

La ministra de Sanidad, Mónica García, destacó que estos resultados son fruto tanto del trabajo altamente cualificado de los profesionales sanitarios como de la solidaridad de las familias donantes, que aceptan la donación en momentos de gran dificultad personal.

Damon calificó como 'increíblemente alarmante' un incidente federal de control migratorio ocurrido recientemente y aseguró que muchas personas viven con tensión y miedo ante la forma en que algunos agentes están actuando en la vía pública.

El actor puso el foco en la falta de formación adecuada y en el uso de tácticas que describió como excesivamente teatrales y agresivas, incluyendo la presencia de agentes enmascarados durante algunas intervenciones. Según Damon, esta forma de actuar no solo aumenta la conflictividad, sino que también erosiona la confianza ciudadana en las fuerzas de seguridad. Para subrayar su punto, afirmó que amigos suyos que trabajan en cuerpos policiales le han reconocido que ellos no habrían gestionado esas situaciones de la misma mane]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/matt-damon-critica-las-tacticas-del-ice-y-alerta-sobre-la-escalada-de-confrontacion-policial-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/matt-damon-critica-las-tacticas-del-ice-y-alerta-sobre-la-escalada-de-confrontacion-policial-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El TSJA declara nulo el despido de una empleada del hogar embarazada aunque la empleadora desconociera su estado]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias ha confirmado la nulidad del despido de una empleada del hogar que estaba embarazada en el momento de la extinción de su contrato, pese a que la empleadora, una mujer de 93 años, desconocía dicha circunstancia. La resolución ratifica el fallo previo del Juzgado de lo Social número 4 de Oviedo y refuerza la protección objetiva que la normativa laboral otorga al embarazo.

Los hechos se produjeron a comienzos de febrero de 2025, cuando la empleadora comunicó a la trabajadora la finalización del contrato, que era a tiempo parcial, con una jornada de 15 horas semanales. En la carta de despido se alegaron dos motivos: la necesidad de contar con una persona que pudiera trabajar más horas debido al empeoramiento del estado de salud de la empleadora y la pérdida de confianza derivada de una ausencia prolongada de la trabajadora, que había viajado a su país de origen.

Durante el encuentro privado, Machado entregó a Trump la medalla original de su Premio Nobel de la Paz 2025, otorgado por su lucha por la democracia en Venezuela. El gesto fue presentado como un reconocimiento al 'compromiso único' de Trump con la libertad del país, especialmente tras la intervención militar estadounidense del 3 de enero que resultó en la captura de Nicolás Maduro.

Trump aceptó el obsequio y lo calificó en Truth Social como un 'gran honor' y un 'gesto maravilloso de respeto mutuo', atribuyéndose los méritos 'por el trabajo que yo he hecho'. Sin embargo, la postura oficial de la Administración no varió: la portavoz Karoline Leavitt confirmó que Trump mantiene su apoyo a Delcy Rodríguez como figura clave para liderar la transición en Venezuela, sin respaldar a Machado como sucesora.

Por un lado, se ha aplicado una subida salarial del 1,5% en las retribuciones de los diputados con efectos desde enero, siguiendo el decreto ley aprobado en diciembre de 2025 que regula las subidas para el sector público (2,5% en 2025 y 1,5% en 2026). Existe la posibilidad de un incremento adicional del 0,5% si la inflación supera el 1,5% al cierre del año, abonándose en el año siguiente. Esta decisión se adoptó con el apoyo de la mayoría de grupos, la abstención de Junts y el voto en contra de Vox, aunque tanto PP como Vox criticaron la aprobación por decreto sin negociación previa.

Por otro lado, se ha modificado el calendario de plenos para ampliar los días libres de los diputados, adaptándolos a los festivos de todas las comunidades autónomas, al menos entre febrero y junio.

Investigaciones arqueológicas recientes han permitido acceder a un sistema de cuevas y a una cámara que había permanecido sellada durante unos 40.000 años, lo que ha abierto nuevas líneas de estudio sobre los neandertales que habitaron la zona.

Aunque el complejo fue descubierto a comienzos del siglo XX, no fue hasta la década de 1980 cuando se iniciaron excavaciones sistemáticas. Desde entonces, los trabajos han revelado abundantes indicios de actividad humana que se remontan hasta hace aproximadamente 100.000 años.

Así lo concluye el Consejo Asesor Científico de las Academias Europeas (EASAC), que estima que el coste necesario para restaurar ecosistemas degradados en la Unión Europea, unos 150.000 millones de euros, se vería ampliamente compensado por beneficios que alcanzarían los 1,8 billones de euros. Estos beneficios provendrían principalmente de la reducción del riesgo de catástrofes naturales, la mayor estabilidad de los sistemas alimentarios e hídricos y el descenso del gasto sanitario y de recuperación tras eventos extremos.

Según EASAC, los ecosistemas europeos se encuentran gravemente deteriorados: apenas el 1,4 % de los bosques permanece intacto y solo el 3,3 % del territorio tiene una intervención humana mínima.

Según el autor, el conflicto no es solo militar, sino el detonante de tres guerras simultáneas: Rusia contra Ucrania (en realidad proxy de la OTAN), Estados Unidos contra Europa (mediante la desindustrialización de Alemania tras el sabotaje de Nord Stream), y el enfrentamiento global entre el orden unipolar liderado por EE.UU. y el emergente mundo multipolar impulsado por Rusia y China.

Escobar destaca la superioridad estratégica rusa, con control del 20% del territorio ucraniano, avances tecnológicos como el misil hipersónico Oreshnik y una postura de no negociar desde debilidad, sino de esperar una victoria total.

El local, con unos 300 metros cuadrados, ha funcionado en los últimos meses como espacio conmemorativo del 50 aniversario de Zara, convertido casi en un museo efímero de la marca.

El suceso ocurrió cuando el joven y su padre, Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, se encontraban comprando comida en un McDonald’s y fueron interceptados por agentes enmascarados. Durante la actuación policial, el padre, que se encontraba en situación irregular, fue reducido violentamente, mientras que Arnoldo, ciudadano estadounidense y menor de edad, fue sometido a una maniobra de estrangulamiento que le dificultó la respiración.

A pesar de que el adolescente informó a los agentes de su condición de ciudadano y de su edad, la intervención no se detuvo.

La serie original, estrenada en 1983 y producida por Sunrise, se destacó por su enfoque realista en la guerra y la psicología de los soldados que pilotan ATs, vehículos humanoides de combate. A diferencia de los superrobots de la época, los ATs eran lentos, frágiles y cada enfrentamiento tenía consecuencias palpables, lo que otorgaba a la serie un aura de realismo único. La nueva producción contará con animación moderna a cargo del estudio Production I.G y buscará mantener el tono oscuro y crudo de la serie original, incorporando además la visión filosófica y estética característica de Oshii, conocida por explorar temas de política, moralidad y existencia humana. Este remake se estrena como parte de las celebraciones del 50º aniversario de Sunrise, y promete combinar nostalgia con una narrativa prof]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mamoru-oshii-dirigira-el-remake-de-armored-trooper-votoms-die-graue-hexe-en-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mamoru-oshii-dirigira-el-remake-de-armored-trooper-votoms-die-graue-hexe-en-2026</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canadá y China firman acuerdos para fortalecer lazos bilaterales y reducir la dependencia comercial de Estados Unidos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro canadiense, Mark Carney, se reunió en Pekín con el presidente chino Xi Jinping el 16 de enero de 2026, en la primera visita de un líder canadiense a China en ocho años. Durante el encuentro, ambas partes firmaron varios memorandos de entendimiento en ámbitos como energía, exportación de alimentos para mascotas, cultura y turismo, con el objetivo de profundizar la asociación estratégica tras casi una década de tensiones marcadas por episodios como la detención de una ejecutiva china en 2018 y aranceles a vehículos eléctricos.

Carney destacó los avances desde la cumbre APEC de octubre y subrayó los beneficios mutuos de una relación más estable, mientras que Xi Jinping calificó el encuentro como un punto de inflexión hacia una colaboración beneficiosa para la paz global. Esta iniciativa responde principalmente a la elevada dependencia comercial de Canadá con Estados Unidos, donde más del 75% de sus exportaciones tienen como destino ese país, agravada por los aranceles ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-y-china-firman-acuerdos-para-fortalecer-lazos-bilaterales-y-reducir-la-dependencia-comercial-de-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-y-china-firman-acuerdos-para-fortalecer-lazos-bilaterales-y-reducir-la-dependencia-comercial-de-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Postales históricas y satíricas de la Guerra Ruso-Japonesa (1904-1905)]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo presenta una extensa colección de postales producidas durante la Guerra Ruso-Japonesa de 1904-1905, un conflicto en el que Japón derrotó a la Rusia zarista, convirtiéndose en la primera potencia asiática moderna en vencer a una europea. El 8 de febrero de 1904, Japón lanzó un ataque sorpresa contra la flota rusa en Port Arthur, iniciando una guerra que causó cientos de miles de muertos y terminó con el Tratado de Portsmouth en septiembre de 1905.

Millones de estas postales, tanto japonesas como extranjeras, se distribuyeron mundialmente gracias al auge de este medio de comunicación masiva. Muchas de ellas muestran escenas de batallas, el bloqueo naval, la destrucción de la flota del Báltico rusa y representaciones satíricas o propagandísticas: soldados japoneses devorando rusos, osos rusos atrapados, personificaciones de países y críticas al imperialismo.

Sin embargo, el pacto llega acompañado de importantes controversias, especialmente en materia de seguridad alimentaria y control de productos químicos prohibidos en la UE. Las organizaciones agrarias europeas alertan de que el texto definitivo no resuelve los problemas de trazabilidad en el uso de pesticidas, antibióticos y hormonas que sí están vetados en Europa por sus riesgos para la salud humana.

Los negociadores de Mercosur han reconocido dificultades para supervisar el uso de sustancias como Carbendazim, Glufosinato, Mancozeb, Benomyl o Tiofanato-metyl, productos baratos y de uso extendido en América Latina, pero prohibidos en la UE.

La escasez de chips y el aumento de precios han generado un mercado complicado, especialmente en la DDR5, mientras que la DDR4 sigue siendo más asequible aunque también ha sufrido subidas. Existen varias estrategias para adaptarse a esta situación. Una opción es volver a PCs con DDR4, lo que permite ahorrar entre un 30% y un 40% respecto a la DDR5, aunque implica usar placas base y procesadores más antiguos, como AM4 en AMD o LGA1700 en Intel. Otra alternativa es montar uno mismo los chips DDR5, comprando los componentes por separado y soldándolos, algo que solo es viable para quienes tengan experiencia avanzada en electrónica. También se pueden usar adaptadores de SO-DIMM a DIMM, aprovechando la RAM de portátiles que actualmente tiene mejor stock y precio. Estas soluciones permiten ahorrar dinero o resolver problemas de compatibilidad, aunque no siempre ofrecen el rendimiento máximo.

Así lo afirmó la portavoz presidencial, Karoline Leavitt, en una rueda de prensa en la que subrayó que la presencia militar de socios europeos no influye en el proceso de toma de decisiones del mandatario ni en sus objetivos estratégicos en el Ártico.

Estas declaraciones se producen tras el anuncio de Dinamarca, país del que depende Groenlandia como territorio autónomo, de reforzar de forma inmediata su presencia militar en la isla y aumentar las maniobras defensivas.

Entre los organismos afectados se encuentra la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS), responsable de las residencias públicas de mayores, un ámbito especialmente tensionado tras la pandemia de covid-19.

Gracias a la introducción del artículo 67 bis, la Consejería de Hacienda quedó habilitada para transferir a la Tesorería General fondos no gastados por estos organismos, incluso aquellos que antes estaban expresamente protegidos.

El presentador, que actualmente conduce el programa de actualidad 'Malas Lenguas' en TVE, ha explicado que en su casa no había comodidades básicas como agua caliente, lavadora, frigorífico o ducha, y que su madre calentaba el agua en una lata para poder bañar a la familia.

Lejos de presentar estos recuerdos desde la queja, Cintora reivindica aquella etapa como una infancia feliz y formativa. Se define como parte de una generación de 'hijos de la calle', marcada por la libertad, el juego al aire libre y una relación muy directa con el entorno natural y social del pueblo.

Por primera vez en al menos diez años, la capital británica se convierte en el lugar del Reino Unido donde es más probable vender una vivienda con pérdidas. En 2025, el 14,8% de los vendedores londinenses cerraron operaciones por debajo del precio de compra, frente a una media nacional del 8,7%, según datos de la inmobiliaria Hamptons. Distritos como Tower Hamlets, símbolo del auge financiero de los años 2000, concentran el ajuste, con casi un 30% de ventas en negativo.

El cambio no responde solo a un ciclo económico adverso, sino a un giro estructural del modelo que convirtió a Londres en una ‘ciudad-activo’. Durante décadas, el mercado se sostuvo sobre la llegada masiva de capital extranjero, atraído por la estabilidad jurídica y un marco fiscal favorable.

La agencia de Naciones Unidas advierte de que esta cifra podría ser mayor, ya que solo incluye los casos en los que se dispone de información suficiente y verificada. Del total de víctimas infantiles contabilizadas, 60 eran niños y 40 niñas, y la mayoría de las muertes se produjeron como consecuencia directa de acciones militares.

Unicef señala que los fallecimientos se deben principalmente a ataques aéreos, bombardeos con drones, disparos de tanques, armas de fuego y el uso de cuadricópteros armados. Un número menor de víctimas se ha visto afectado por la explosión de munición sin detonar abandonada en zonas habitadas, lo que pone de relieve el peligro persistente para la población civil incluso durante la tregua.

Según Leavitt, el comentario fue hecho de forma facetiosa, en el contexto de que su administración está haciendo un gran trabajo y cumpliendo con lo que los estadounidenses esperaban, por lo que «quizá deberíamos seguir adelante» sin interrupciones.

Las declaraciones de Trump surgieron mientras expresaba su frustración por la tendencia histórica de que el partido del presidente en ejercicio pierde escaños en las elecciones de mitad de mandato (midterms). Trump reconoció que «es algo psicológico profundo», pero que cuando se gana la presidencia, normalmente no se ganan las midterm.

Trump respondió visiblemente molesto, profiriendo un 'f*ck you' y mostrando el dedo medio, gesto captado en vídeo que se volvió viral rápidamente.

Como consecuencia, Ford decidió suspender sin sueldo al trabajador de forma inmediata, medida que la empresa justificó por falta de respeto en sus instalaciones.

Tras una vida que incluyó años en la Legión y experiencias en Madrid, decidió convertirse en hospitalero en este lugar inhóspito, ofreciendo refugio sencillo, café caliente y una acogida muy especial a los peregrinos, sin agua corriente ni electricidad convencional. Se consideraba heredero espiritual de la Orden del Temple y recreaba en su albergue un ambiente cargado de simbolismo templario, con ceremonias diarias de oración por la paz y rituales sincréticos.

La mayoría de estas trabajadoras, que cobran alrededor de 950 euros netos al mes, denuncian que elaboran productos de alto valor —como abrigos de 4.000 euros o bolsos de más de 2.000— mientras perciben salarios muy bajos en un contexto de fuerte aumento del coste de la vida.

El conflicto surge tras meses de negociación sin acuerdo, ya que la dirección de la empresa presentó una propuesta de incremento salarial que el sindicato CIG califica de «insulto» y «miserable», con mejoras mínimas (apenas un 0,2 % adicional en algunos tramos de antigüedad) que solo afectarían a un reducido número de personas y supondrían un coste mensual muy bajo para la compañía en comparación con sus ingresos.

La importancia del Archipiélago radicaba en su ubicación geográfica, clave en las rutas marítimas que conectaban Europa, África y América, un factor esencial para una potencia en plena expansión militar y comercial.

Dentro de las Islas, Tenerife concentró la mayor atención de los planificadores militares estadounidenses. Informes elaborados por el agregado naval William S.

El encuentro se enmarca en el contexto de la profunda crisis política, institucional y social que atraviesa Venezuela desde hace años, y refleja el interés del Gobierno estadounidense en respaldar a los actores de la oposición democrática frente al régimen de Nicolás Maduro.

Durante la reunión, Trump y Machado habrían abordado la situación de los derechos humanos en Venezuela, el deterioro de las instituciones democráticas y el impacto de la crisis económica y humanitaria sobre la población venezolana. La presencia de Machado, una de las figuras más visibles y críticas del chavismo, simboliza el reconocimiento internacional de sectores de la oposición que abogan por una transición política mediante mecanismos democráticos.

Según diversas fuentes periodísticas (principalmente NewsWire), Bruselas impulsa este esquema para cubrir las escasez de mano de obra existentes en ambos territorios. De aprobarse, permitiría a los ciudadanos australianos residir y trabajar en cualquiera de los 27 países de la UE —entre ellos Francia, Alemania, Italia, España, Países Bajos o Irlanda— durante un periodo de hasta cuatro años, sin necesidad de tener un empleo precontratado antes de llegar. Esto supondría una mejora sustancial respecto a los visados actuales de vacaciones-trabajo, que suelen tener límites de edad, duración más corta y otras restricciones, e incluso podría abrir vías hacia una estancia o asentamient]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ue-propone-un-esquema-de-movilidad-laboral-bidireccional-con-australia-para-facilitar-vivir-y-trabajar-hasta-cuatro-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ue-propone-un-esquema-de-movilidad-laboral-bidireccional-con-australia-para-facilitar-vivir-y-trabajar-hasta-cuatro-anos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reseña de Los Archivos Secretos de Sherlock Holmes: El Caso de la Rosa Tatuada, secuela de 1996]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 1996, Electronic Arts y Mythos Software lanzaron la secuela de la aventura gráfica de 1992, 'Los Archivos Secretos de Sherlock Holmes: El Caso de la Rosa Tatuada'. Tras el éxito moderado de la primera entrega ('El Caso del Escalpelo Mellado'), este título mantuvo la esencia jugable centrada en la narrativa y los diálogos, en lugar de puzzles excesivamente basados en prueba y error. La historia transcurre en octubre de 1889: una explosión en el Club Diógenes deja gravemente herido a Mycroft Holmes, hermano de Sherlock, lo que sume al famoso detective en una profunda depresión. El doctor Watson debe investigar por su cuenta para encontrar pistas que reactiven el interés de Holmes por el caso.

La jugabilidad es continuista: inicialmente controlamos a Watson y, tras motivar a Holmes, pasamos a manejarlo a él. El juego destaca por la importancia de los diálogos exhaustivos, ya que muchas conversaciones desbloquean otras y avanzan la trama, aunque esto puede generar frustración si se omi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-los-archivos-secretos-de-sherlock-holmes-el-caso-de-la-rosa-tatuada-secuela-de-1996</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-los-archivos-secretos-de-sherlock-holmes-el-caso-de-la-rosa-tatuada-secuela-de-1996</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 08:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[India y la Unión Europea avanzan hacia la firma de un amplio acuerdo de libre comercio]]></title><description><![CDATA[India y la Unión Europea se encuentran en la fase final de las negociaciones para cerrar un tratado de libre comercio que podría convertirse en el más ambicioso firmado hasta ahora por la economía india.

Stanage cuestionó la afirmación de la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, de que ICE 'lo está haciendo todo correctamente', recordando que en el último año 32 personas murieron bajo custodia de ICE, 170 ciudadanos estadounidenses fueron detenidos y, en este caso concreto, una agente disparó a la cabeza y mató a Good.

Al pedir Leavitt su opinión sobre por qué ocurrió el fallecimiento, el periodista respondió que el agente actuó de manera imprudente e injustificada.

Este resurgimiento coincide con los recientes comentarios de Trump sobre su interés en tomar control del territorio danés de Groenlandia, aunque las autoridades danesas reiteran que existe un 'desacuerdo fundamental' con la propuesta estadounidense.

Frente a las promesas del Gobierno, que defendía que reducir la inmigración —tanto legal como irregular— beneficiaría directamente a los trabajadores estadounidenses, los datos oficiales muestran lo contrario. Según el Bureau of Labor Statistics, el número de trabajadores nacidos en el extranjero cayó de forma notable durante 2025, con una reducción de cerca de 900.000 personas desde enero y de más de 1,3 millones desde el máximo alcanzado en marzo de ese mismo año.

Sin embargo, esta contracción de la mano de obra inmigrante no se tradujo en mejores resultados laborales para los nacidos en EE. UU. Al contrario, la tasa de desempleo de este grupo aumentó del 3,7 % en diciembre de 2024 al 4,1 % en diciembre de 2025, lo que supone un incremento del 11 % en un año.

Además, se estudiará un coeficiente reductor para que las horas de guardia coticen y permitan adelantar la jubilación, aunque esto depende de la Seguridad Social. Entre las mejoras retributivas destaca el aumento salarial para los médicos internos residentes (MIR), que sitúa a Asturias como la tercera comunidad mejor pagadora, con un incremento de unos 50 euros sobre la media nacional y un primer año en torno a 1.440 euros brutos.

Según el texto, las Fuerzas Armadas venezolanas (FANB) contaban con capacidad para repeler el ataque (sistemas antiaéreos, radares, etc.), pero optaron por no responder para evitar una escalada que derivara en una invasión militar a gran escala y bombardeos masivos por parte de Estados Unidos.

Un teniente coronel retirado de la FANB, Edgar Alejandro Lugo Pereira, justifica esta decisión argumentando que responder habría desencadenado una catástrofe mayor. El artículo plantea serias dudas sobre la muerte de 32 cubanos que formaban parte de la escolta presidencial, ya que no hubo bajas estadounidenses, lo que alimenta especulaciones sobre una posible neutralización previa (incluso con drogas) o una ejecución posterior.

Estos chips mantienen la arquitectura Zen 5 (con combinación de núcleos Zen 5 y Zen 5c), gráficos integrados RDNA 3.5 y NPU XDNA 2, pero ofrecen mejoras en frecuencias (aumentos de hasta 100 MHz en los modelos tope de gama), mejor soporte de memoria y una segmentación más fina de modelos.

El artículo destaca que las ganancias publicitadas son del 30 % en multinúcleo, solo un 10 % en juegos y hasta un 70 % en productividad, junto con autonomías de batería de al menos 25 horas. Sin embargo, el autor considera que se trata más bien de un cambio cosmético o refresh que de una generación realmente nueva, ya que las innovaciones técnicas son mínimas respecto a la serie anterior.

Tras una reunión de emergencia del Comité Permanente del Politburó, China implementó varias medidas económicas simultáneas para golpear el núcleo del poder estadounidense.

Entre las acciones destacadas se encuentran: la suspensión temporal de transacciones en dólares con empresas del sector defensa como Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon y General Dynamics; la revisión y posible ruptura de contratos eléctricos con proveedores estadounidenses; la anulación de contratos de suministro de petróleo por valor de 47.000 millones de dólares anuales con refinerías de la costa este de EEUU, redirigiendo el crudo hacia países como India, Brasil y Sudáfrica (lo que provocó un alza del 23 % e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-aplica-medidas-economicas-asimetricas-contra-estados-unidos-tras-la-intervencion-en-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-aplica-medidas-economicas-asimetricas-contra-estados-unidos-tras-la-intervencion-en-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España confirma un ataque aéreo en Venezuela y garantiza la seguridad de su personal diplomático]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de España ha confirmado un ataque aéreo ocurrido en Venezuela durante la madrugada del 3 de enero de 2026, que afectó a distintos puntos de Caracas, incluidos los alrededores de instalaciones militares como Fuerte Tiuna y La Carlota.

Singer, a través de su fondo Elliott Investment Management, adquirió en noviembre de 2025 la filial estadounidense de PDVSA, CITGO, por 5.900 millones de dólares en una subasta judicial forzada en Delaware, a pesar de que su valor real se estimaba entre 11.000 y 18.000 millones.

CITGO posee refinerías especializadas en procesar el crudo pesado y azufrado venezolano. Las sanciones y el embargo petrolero impuesto por la administración Trump redujeron drásticamente su rentabilidad al obligarla a comprar petróleo más caro de otros países, lo que facilitó la compra a precio de saldo.

La portavoz adjunta del PP, Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo, había acusado recientemente a Zapatero de intentar impedir una transición democrática real en Venezuela tras la detención de Nicolás Maduro y el bombardeo estadounidense.

Rufián dirigió una pregunta directa a Álvarez de Toledo: '¿Y saben ustedes, sobre todo usted, señora Álvarez de Toledo, por qué le tienen manía a Zapatero?', para inmediatamente responder él mismo. Argumentó que el rechazo del PP hacia Zapatero se debe a que este 'les ganó en 2004', 'derrotó a ETA en 2011' y 'levantó la campaña del año 2023'.

Sin embargo, su legado más duradero está en la infancia de varias generaciones, gracias a su voz en series icónicas como 'La Abeja Maya', 'Tarzán', 'Fraggle Rock' y 'Barrio Sésamo'.

Productores de algodón y soja explican que venden sus cosechas a precios similares a los de hace décadas, mientras que los costes de semillas, fertilizantes, maquinaria y equipos han aumentado más de un 30 % en los últimos cinco años. Esta combinación está llevando a muchas explotaciones familiares, algunas con varias generaciones de historia, al borde de la quiebra.

El impacto de los aranceles se ha intensificado tras la reducción de las exportaciones a China, uno de los principales compradores de soja estadounidense, que reaccionó comprando a competidores como Argentina.

Destacó la Transición como modelo de entendimiento colectivo y la Constitución como garante de derechos, aunque evitó mencionar a figuras controvertidas como Juan Carlos I o temas sensibles como la dictadura, los casos de corrupción o el conflicto en Palestina.

En una carta enviada a los fiscales de delitos de odio, Aagesen destacó que estos ataques no solo incluyen lenguaje hostil y descalificaciones, sino que también afectan la percepción pública de la meteorología y pueden frenar la divulgación científica. Un estudio reveló que el 17,6 % de los mensajes hostiles en la red X contenían discursos de odio o ataques personales hacia profesionales que comparten información científica verificada. Otro estudio de 2024 mostró que casi la mitad de las publicaciones relacionadas con el clima incluían negacionismo de la emergencia climática.

La impresora, que quedó destinada para uso exclusivo de los socios jubilados, presentaba un fallo en la toma de red. Para solucionarlo, se trasladó la impresora a un despacho reservado a estos socios, lo que facilitaba la recogida de impresiones sin interferir en la zona común de la oficina. La solución fue bien recibida tanto por los socios jubilados como por la nueva gerencia. Sin embargo, días después, la alarma de la oficina comenzó a activarse a las cuatro de la madrugada debido al ruido de la impresora cuando uno de los socios jubilados imprimía grandes cantidades de documentos por la noche. Tras investigar el problema, se estableció un horario específico para las impresiones nocturnas, evitando que se disparara la alarma, y todos los implicados tomaron la situación con humor.

El semanario ha calificado de “valiente” el mensaje de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, en el que relativizaba las denuncias y desviaba el foco hacia otros países y hacia la llamada “ultraizquierda”, un posicionamiento que ha sido ampliamente criticado por su tono y contenido.

En un artículo difundido en su cuenta de X, ¡Hola! elogia a Ayuso por lo que considera una defensa firme del “cantante más universal”, destacando la trayectoria artística de Julio Iglesias y su condición de icono intergeneracional desde su victoria en el Festival de Benidorm de 1968.

La tarjeta, desarrollada con un sistema de autocustodia, permite conectar directamente la wallet personal del usuario con los comercios que aceptan tarjetas Visa o Mastercard, tanto físicas como online. Su funcionamiento se basa en un smart contract que convierte de forma instantánea los fondos cripto en dinero fiduciario (fiat) en el momento del pago, de modo que el comercio recibe euros sin saber que el cliente ha usado criptomonedas. Este proceso mantiene los fondos principales del usuario bajo su control total, sin necesidad de custodiar activos en plataformas centralizadas.

Maduro declaró el «estado de conmoción exterior» y llamó a una movilización defensiva del país, mientras el presidente colombiano, Gustavo Petro, denunció públicamente bombardeos sobre la capital venezolana y solicitó una reunión urgente del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y de la OEA.

En concreto, se registró una reducción de 21.046 unidades productivas —que incluyen empresas privadas, organismos públicos y entidades que emplean al menos a una persona—, lo que equivale a un cierre promedio de unas 30 por día. En el año 2025, la caída fue de 8.830 empleadores.

Esta disminución se tradujo en la pérdida de 272.607 puestos de trabajo registrados, pasando de 9.857.173 trabajadores en noviembre de 2023 a 9.584.566 en octubre de 2025, una caída del 2,77 %.

Según él, actualmente coexisten cinco sistemas de relaciones internacionales incompatibles entre sí, lo que equivale a la inexistencia real de un orden jurídico global válido.

La decisión, comunicada de forma escueta por la formación liderada por Santiago Abascal, supone un nuevo paso en la reconfiguración del núcleo de poder del partido y consolida una tendencia iniciada meses atrás con la pérdida de peso de varios de sus dirigentes históricos.

Ortega Smith, uno de los fundadores de Vox y figura clave en sus primeros años, ya había sido apartado previamente de la portavocía adjunta en el Congreso. Aunque mantiene su acta de diputado y su cargo en el Ayuntamiento de Madrid, su salida de la Ejecutiva reduce de manera significativa su influencia en la toma de decisiones estratégicas.

A partir del caso venezolano, el texto sostiene que no se trata de una intervención para promover libertades políticas, sino de una estrategia de control de recursos estratégicos —energía, minerales críticos, agua y alimentos— necesarios para sostener la carrera tecnológica, especialmente en inteligencia artificial, frente a China.

El autor vincula esta ofensiva con una alianza estructural entre Silicon Valley y la Casa Blanca, que considera imprescindible asegurar un suministro masivo y rápido de energía para el desarrollo de la IA. En este marco, América Latina aparece como periferia subordinada, sometida a amenazas, chantajes diplomáticos y experimentos de gobernanza que erosionan la soberanía nacional.

Heba Muraisi, Kamran Ahmed y Lewie Chiaramello, que llevaban entre 52 y 73 días sin ingerir alimentos, decidieron suspender la protesta después de que el Ejecutivo británico cancelara una licitación pública valorada en 2.000 millones de libras con Elbit Systems UK, filial de la principal empresa armamentística israelí.

La decisión, confirmada por el diario The Times, respondía a una de las demandas centrales de los huelguistas, que denunciaban tanto el apoyo militar británico a Israel como las condiciones de encarcelamiento que sufrían tras ser detenidos por acciones directas contra instalaciones de Elbit y por la ilegalización de Palestine Action.

La tecnología genera preocupación, con un 83,7% temiendo que los robots sustituyan puestos de trabajo, mientras que los desastres naturales también generan inquietud (67,3%). La encuesta refleja un declive en los indicadores tradicionales de la familia: más divorcios (64,4%) y menos nacimientos (68,5%), con un retraso en la maternidad que ha marcado récords históricos. La confianza en instituciones internacionales es baja: solo el 15,5% cree en la eficacia futura de la ONU y un 30,4% en la UE.

En ellas, la Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo determina que entregar facturas a la Agencia Tributaria durante un proceso de inspección no vulnera el derecho a no autoincriminarse, siempre que esta obligación derive de la ley. Según el alto tribunal, documentos como facturas o libros contables tienen una 'existencia independiente de la voluntad' del contribuyente, por lo que su entrega entra dentro de las obligaciones tributarias reguladas en la Ley General Tributaria y el Reglamento de Facturación.

Según las primeras investigaciones, las víctimas fueron agredidas de forma extremadamente violenta mediante golpes y patadas, sin que se utilizara ningún tipo de arma de fuego. Dos de los hombres fallecieron a consecuencia de los traumatismos múltiples sufridos, mientras que el tercero permanece ingresado en estado grave en el Hospital General de Elche.

Según el político ruso, los líderes europeos no actuarían ante una posible agresión estadounidense y acabarían ‘entregando Groenlandia’ sin oponer resistencia. El comentario, cargado de desprecio, parece alinearse con el discurso habitual del Kremlin, que busca debilitar la cohesión de la OTAN y resaltar las divisiones internas de Occidente.

Kiciński explicó que su opinión se basa en experiencias cotidianas, como tener que arreglar ordenadores con Windows de familiares cercanos, situaciones que le resultan frustrantes y que refuerzan su percepción negativa del sistema operativo.

Tus impuestos financian la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMT), los sueldos del jefe y todo el personal de la Unidad Militar de Emergencias (UME), así como policías, bomberos, médicas y enfermeros que responden a desastres naturales. Además, cubren la gestión de cuencas hidrológicas, la reconstrucción de infraestructuras dañadas, ayudas a damnificados y la construcción de nuevas viviendas. Se subraya que los impuestos subvencionan organizaciones como Cáritas y otras ONG, además de servicios cotidianos como colegios, hospitales, carreteras, alumbrado público, alcantarillado, trenes, aeropuertos, docentes, basureros, cirujanos, tratamientos oncológicos, pediatras, transporte urbano, parques y polideportivos.

Aunque la Comisión Europea lo presenta como un paso clave hacia el libre comercio y la cooperación internacional, sus detractores advierten que beneficia principalmente a las grandes corporaciones, especialmente a la industria automovilística alemana, y pone en riesgo el campo europeo. El tratado suprime más del 90% de los aranceles bilaterales, lo que podría ahorrar a las empresas comunitarias más de 4.000 millones de euros anuales, pero se teme que los pequeños agricultores sufran la competencia desleal de productos procedentes de Brasil, Argentina, Paraguay y Uruguay, donde las normas laborales y medioambientales son menos estrictas.

Durante su participación en los programas televisivos 'El programa de Ana Rosa' y 'Y ahora Sonsoles', Arcusa calificó de 'montaje' las denuncias de dos exempleadas que acusan al cantante de agresión sexual y trata de personas supuestamente ocurridas en 2021. El músico argumentó que una relación de abuso mantenida durante un largo periodo de tiempo no podría considerarse violación, sugiriendo que existiría consentimiento en tales circunstancias, unas declaraciones que han sido ampliamente criticadas por su falta de sensibilidad hacia las víctimas de violencia sexual.

Arcusa también defendió la reputación de Julio Iglesias, asegurando que 'siempre ha sido respetuoso con las mujeres' y que las acusaciones carecen de fundamento.

Al salir por las escaleras de la discoteca hacia la calle, fueron empujados por los vigilantes, lo que provocó que el cliente recriminara la acción. En respuesta, los porteros comenzaron a golpearle repetidamente, dejándole inconsciente. La Policía Nacional y el Samur-Protección Civil atendieron la emergencia, y la víctima fue ingresada en la UCI del Hospital Clínico San Carlos, donde fue inducida al coma y se encuentra en proceso de recuperación.

Los hechos se produjeron el 13 de enero de 2026 y fueron detectados por agentes del Grupo de Investigación y Análisis del Tráfico, quienes observaron al hombre llegando en su propio vehículo. Además, durante la comprobación, los agentes descubrieron que el coche no contaba con el seguro obligatorio en vigor y que la Inspección Técnica de Vehículos (ITV) se hallaba caducada.

Montero replicó exigiendo explicaciones al PP sobre la procedencia de la información que manejaban, insinuando que podrían tener acceso a datos confidenciales de la investigación: '¿De dónde ha sacado esa información?'.

Este patrón ha sido criticado por los grupos opositores, que destacan que en otros parlamentos con mayoría absoluta del PP, como el andaluz, la tasa de iniciativas no admitidas es mucho menor, apenas un 0,95%, mientras que en Madrid aproximadamente una de cada cuatro propuestas no se discute.

Además, reflexiona sobre cómo la falta de disciplina en casa y la excesiva indulgencia pueden influir en el comportamiento de los niños. También subraya que espacios como el patio no son un derecho absoluto, sino herramientas educativas que permiten aplicar normas de convivencia y responsabilidad.

Zugasti critica el enfoque del periódico por mantener una visión complaciente y machista del artista, reforzando estereotipos de 'mujeriego' que, según argumenta, resultan ofensivos y obsoletos. En particular, señala como ejemplo que El Mundo recoge, sin cuestionarlo, que a Iglesias le gustan 'las cenas, los conciertos y los culitos', comentario que refuerza esa imagen sexista. La autora contrasta este tratamiento mediático con los valores de igualdad actuales, recordando episodios polémicos como el vídeo viral en el que el cantante fuerza a una presentadora a besarle.

Esta declaración se produce un día después de que un agente federal disparara a un hombre que le atacó con una pala y un palo de escoba, lo que aumentó la tensión en la ciudad tras la muerte de Renee Good a manos de un agente de ICE. Trump justificó su amenaza afirmando que los políticos de Minnesota no estaban deteniendo a los agitadores que atacaban a los agentes federales, a quienes calificó de patriotas que solo cumplían con su trabajo. La Ley de Insurrección ha sido invocada en más de veinte ocasiones en la historia de EE. UU., la última en 1992 por George H.W.

Según la AEMET, el fenómeno se origina por el choque entre una masa de aire húmedo procedente del Atlántico y otra de origen polar que entra por los Pirineos. Este encuentro de masas puede generar acumulaciones notables de nieve, aunque los modelos meteorológicos actuales apuntan a que la intensidad y la duración del episodio no igualarán las de la histórica borrasca ‘Filomena’ de enero de 2021. Aquella tormenta fue excepcional por la combinación de aire cálido del sur y aire ártico atrapado sobre la Península, lo que provocó cerca de 30 horas seguidas de nevada en Madrid, con espesores de hasta 60 centímetros y un impacto socioeconómico muy alto.

Jorgemet argumenta que Kohan comete errores al considerar que solo los escritores sufren esta 'socialización' en internet, ignorando que afecta a industrias como prensa, música, cine y software, ya que se trata de bienes digitales fácilmente reproducibles. Critica la analogía de Kohan con servicios no digitalizables como radiografías o psicoanálisis, y defiende que el valor de la literatura, desde una perspectiva marxista, no equivale a un valor de cambio eterno, sino a tiempo de trabajo socialmente necesario que internet altera. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-martin-kohan-sobre-el-intercambio-de-libros-en-internet-y-derechos-de-autor</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-martin-kohan-sobre-el-intercambio-de-libros-en-internet-y-derechos-de-autor</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El derecho a la educación en la lengua materna en la Comunidad Valenciana]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo defiende que en la Comunidad Valenciana las familias tienen derecho a elegir la lengua materna de sus hijos para la educación, ya sea castellano o valenciano, sin que sea una obligación impartir clases en valenciano.

Esta característica distingue a los verdaderos científicos de los que se limitan a seguir modas o aproximaciones superficiales. El artículo resalta que la teoría del valor, la defensa de la ley de Say y la adhesión a la teoría cuantitativa del dinero en Ricardo están conectadas entre sí precisamente porque su pensamiento es coherente y metódico. Además, el texto propone una ética del conocimiento: el verdadero peligro no es equivocarse, sino quedarse en la superficie de los problemas por desinterés o conveniencia.

Partiendo de la decisión reciente de Australia de prohibir el acceso a redes a menores de 16 años, el autor argumenta que los gobiernos deberán adoptar medidas más firmes para proteger la salud mental y el desarrollo cognitivo de los menores. Sostiene que la gestión familiar ha fracasado, ya que la mayoría de los niños acceden a móviles y redes a edades muy tempranas, pese a las recomendaciones científicas en contra. 

El texto recoge evidencias que muestran que las redes sociales están diseñadas para ser adictivas, afectando la corteza prefrontal y el sistema dopaminérgico, lo que conlleva consecuencias graves: menor capacidad de atención, aumento de la ansiedad y la depresión, conductas autolesivas, pérdida de autoestima y dificultades en las relaciones sociales.

La declaración de la ISA aborda la situación de Palestina desde una perspectiva sociológica y busca promover la solidaridad internacional con la población afectada, al mismo tiempo que fomenta la investigación y el análisis crítico sobre los conflictos políticos y sociales en la región. La Asociación de Historia Contemporánea enfatiza que respaldar esta declaración no solo implica un gesto de solidaridad, sino también un compromiso con los valores del conocimiento, la historia y el debate informado, recordando la importancia de contextualizar los hechos y promover el respeto por los derechos humanos.

El autor destaca que los bolcheviques, en 1917, evitaron apresurarse hacia la insurrección hasta que las condiciones materiales y sociales hicieran posible el éxito, subrayando así la importancia de la preparación política, económica y militar. Según Trotsky, una revolución sólo puede triunfar cuando se produce un cambio moral dentro del ejército, lo que implica que los soldados dejen de sostener al régimen burgués. Jorgemet enfatiza que este aspecto militar ha sido olvidado por la izquierda contemporánea y que hoy el contexto es distinto, pues los soldados y policías son profesionales y conscientes de su papel en la defensa del orden establecido. A través de las citas de Trotsky, se expone la tensión interior del soldado conscripto, atr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-disciplina-militar-y-su-papel-en-las-revoluciones-segun-trotsky</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-disciplina-militar-y-su-papel-en-las-revoluciones-segun-trotsky</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 18:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El papel del castigo en la corrección de conductas infantiles según la ciencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda la eficacia del castigo como herramienta para corregir conductas en niños, subrayando que, lejos de ser un método para enseñar comportamientos correctos, su función principal es detener conductas inapropiadas después de haber intentado otras estrategias. Según el texto, los castigos en entornos educativos son aplicados únicamente tras agotar alternativas como explicaciones, avisos y establecimiento de límites, y siempre de manera ética y proporcional. Los ejemplos incluyen desde medidas leves, como pasar unos minutos en un rincón tranquilo o escribir sobre la conducta, hasta medidas más serias, como perder una excursión o un recreo completo, evitando cualquier forma de humillación o daño físico. Además, el artículo señala que el castigo está presente de forma natural en la vida adulta, incluso en situaciones cotidianas como ignorar llamadas o establecer recordatorios visibles.

La empleada le explicó que la normativa establece que, al utilizar la autopista, debe abonar el peaje, independientemente de la causa de la desviación. Tras varios minutos de discusión, no se llegó a ningún acuerdo, y se le indicó que debía aparcar su vehículo y no continuar hasta abonar el importe correspondiente.

El fiscal Francisco Javier Redondo López argumenta que la querella se basa únicamente en conjeturas, suposiciones y deducciones infundadas, sin presentar hechos concretos que indiquen la participación de Zapatero en actividades delictivas. Hazte Oír fundamentaba su acusación en la detención de Maduro por las autoridades estadounidenses y en su pertenencia al denominado Cártel de los Soles, deduciendo de manera automática que Zapatero habría estado implicado, lo cual la Fiscalía descarta por completo.

En agosto de 2025 asistió a una feria laboral en Texas donde, a pesar de su conocida postura crítica hacia ICE y su historial público contrario al gobierno de Donald Trump, fue aceptada como candidata sin apenas verificación. El proceso resultó sorprendentemente superficial: entrevistas breves, escasos controles de identidad y una evaluación mínima. Pese a no haber completado ningún documento formal ni los pasos exigidos, ICE la incorporó oficialmente en su sistema como agente, asignándole destino y número de empleado.

El artículo analiza en profundidad el planteamiento táctico del técnico madridista, destacando su apuesta por los jóvenes de la cantera —como Cestero y Jiménez— y su intención de recuperar la presión alta como modelo de juego. Sin embargo, el intento fracasó: el pressing fue descoordinado, el equipo se partió y la defensa quedó expuesta. La falta de sincronía entre los jugadores y la mala interpretación del modelo presionante pusieron de manifiesto fallos estructurales más allá del esfuerzo individual. 

En ataque, el 4-3-3 de Arbeloa se mostró previsible. Vinicius y Mastantuono actuaron como extremos muy abiertos, sin conexión interior ni apoyo suficiente desde el eje central, donde Güler apenas pudo influir.

La dirigente de Sumar considera que la situación política y social de España exige una 'urgencia democrática' y que la experiencia de 2023 demuestra que la colaboración entre fuerzas progresistas fue decisiva para frenar a la derecha y a la extrema derecha. Díaz ha insistido en que las disputas internas deben evitarse y ha apelado a la responsabilidad histórica de todas las formaciones de izquierda, subrayando que quien no entienda esta emergencia se coloca en 'el lado incorrecto de la Historia'.

Eagleton rebate la idea de que Marx defendiera una utopía perfecta y sin conflictos, aclarando que el comunismo no eliminaría la agresividad, la envidia o la competitividad humanas, sino que modificaría las instituciones que las canalizan. Según el autor, en una sociedad socialista seguirían existiendo comportamientos problemáticos —oportunismo, egoísmo o conflictos—, pero se manifestarían de forma distinta al desaparecer la lógica explotadora del capitalismo.

El texto subraya que el comunismo, lejos de acabar con el conflicto, podría incluso aumentarlo al involucrar más personas en decisiones democráticas y procesos colectivos.

A través de una recopilación detallada de insultos, el texto muestra cómo Sarmiento utiliza la palabra como arma en una disputa intelectual y política que refleja la tensión del pensamiento argentino posterior a la independencia. Alberdi y Sarmiento discutían sobre el papel de los intelectuales, la figura de Urquiza y el destino de la nación, pero el tono de Sarmiento excede la discusión política y alcanza una dimensión literaria. Su lista de epítetos —que va desde 'abogadillo' hasta 'jorobado de la civilización'— revela no solo desprecio, sino también una estética del agravio, un uso del lenguaje destinado a herir con ingenio.

Esteban, antiguo portavoz de la Unión Progresista de Fiscales, había sido designado por la entonces fiscal general, Dolores Delgado, pero el Supremo rechazó su nombramiento alegando que otro candidato, promovido por la asociación conservadora, estaba más especializado. El Constitucional considera que las decisiones del Supremo vulneraron el régimen legal de nombramiento discrecional, al imponer la especialización en menores como criterio excluyente y dar un trato desigual a Esteban. Estas resoluciones formaron parte de una serie de enfrentamientos entre la Fiscalía General y la sala tercera del Supremo durante los mandatos de Delgado y Álvaro García Ortiz.

Alemania ha confirmado la presencia de 13 soldados de la Bundeswehr para una misión de reconocimiento, mientras que Francia ha enviado tropas de montaña con el objetivo de explorar el terreno ártico.

Esta pieza, con arreglos de José Mario Branco, evoca la tradición folclórica y la resistencia cultural de Portugal durante la era del salazarismo, con letras poéticas que celebran la llegada de la primavera y la libertad, como se intuye en la cita '… que es mi Dios la libertad…'. Respecto a Madredeus, se menciona la 'Versión remasterizada de 1995', refiriéndose probablemente a temas emblemáticos del grupo lisboeta fundado en 1985. Madredeus fusiona fado tradicional con elementos de new age y jazz, liderados por la voz etérea de Teresa Salgueiro y composiciones de Pedro Ayres Magalhães. Su sonido nostálgico, conocido como ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-musical-de-jose-afonso-y-madredeus</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presentacion-musical-de-jose-afonso-y-madredeus</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La coherencia entre racismo y proyecto educativo en el pensamiento de Domingo F. Sarmiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza de forma crítica el pensamiento de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, una figura central y polémica de la historia argentina, centrándose en la relación entre su proyecto de educación pública y sus ideas racistas. A partir de una cita de su obra *Las ciento y una*, el texto sostiene que no existe una contradicción entre el impulso sarmientino a la educación universal y su desprecio hacia los pueblos indígenas, las clases populares y las culturas que consideraba ‘bárbaras’. Por el contrario, ambas dimensiones forman parte de un mismo proyecto político y cultural.

El autor cuestiona la interpretación habitual que presenta a Sarmiento como un personaje ambivalente, con un supuesto “lado bueno” ligado a la educación y un “lado malo” asociado al racismo. Apoyándose en reflexiones de historiadores como Elías Palti y Darío Roldán, el artículo defiende que el objetivo de Sarmiento era una transformación profunda de la sociedad argentina, orientada a sustituir las tradiciones cultu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-coherencia-entre-racismo-y-proyecto-educativo-en-el-pensamiento-de-domingo-f-sarmiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-coherencia-entre-racismo-y-proyecto-educativo-en-el-pensamiento-de-domingo-f-sarmiento</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber Eats abandona el modelo de repartidores autónomos para cumplir la Ley Rider y evitar sanciones]]></title><description><![CDATA[Uber Eats ha anunciado que dejará de trabajar con repartidores autónomos en España tras la advertencia del Ministerio de Trabajo de presentar una denuncia penal contra la empresa por presunto abuso de falsos autónomos. Con esta decisión, la plataforma sigue los pasos de Glovo, que modificó su modelo de negocio en 2025 tras enfrentar un proceso judicial similar. El cambio marca el fin del sistema de riders autónomos en las principales plataformas de reparto, tras varios años de conflicto laboral. 

La compañía ha explicado que todos los repartidores que aún colaboraban como autónomos podrán pasar a formar parte de las flotas con contrato laboral que ya operan para Uber Eats. Según datos de la empresa, más de 7.000 repartidores fueron contratados por flotas asociadas durante 2025.

La isla, rica en minerales estratégicos y con nuevas rutas marítimas abiertas por el deshielo, se ha vuelto esencial para la seguridad europea y transatlántica. En respuesta, Francia ya ha enviado personal militar a Groenlandia y participará en ejercicios conjuntos con Dinamarca, como parte de la operación 'Arctic Endurance', con el objetivo de reforzar la presencia aliada.

Según su visión, las manifestaciones no serían una revuelta popular espontánea, sino una operación planificada por servicios occidentales para desestabilizar al gobierno iraní y debilitar el eje estratégico formado por Irán, Rusia y China. Escobar argumenta que estas acciones responderían a una estrategia más amplia del 'imperio estadounidense' y sus aliados europeos con el fin de impedir la consolidación de un nuevo orden multipolar que desafía la hegemonía occidental. Entre los elementos que destaca se incluye el uso de tecnología de comunicación como los terminales Starlink, la coordinación de redes de activistas formados en países occidentales y la sincronización de las protestas iraníes con crisis en lugares como Venezuela y Ucrania.

Este fallo supone una confirmación definitiva del criterio de que las comunidades de vecinos no pueden exigir el pago de cuotas impagadas más allá del último lustro. El caso que motivó la sentencia se refiere a una comunidad madrileña que reclamaba 6.497,30 euros a unos propietarios por impagos generados entre 2007 y 2014. Los deudores aceptaron abonar 1.696 euros correspondientes a los ejercicios 2013 y 2014, pero se negaron a pagar los anteriores al entender que habían prescrito. Tras analizar el caso, el Supremo avaló esta interpretación, considerando que la reforma de 2015 debía aplicarse también a cuotas anteriores, al tratarse de obligaciones periódicas y sucesivas.

El texto analiza cómo Sarmiento percibe el capitalismo naciente, especialmente en los Estados Unidos, donde se maravilla ante el desarrollo material, la eficiencia y el dinamismo de una sociedad en expansión que no tiene modelos previos de comparación. Frente a la decadencia europea, Sarmiento ve en América del Norte un fenómeno 'grande y noble', aunque difícil de comprender bajo los parámetros tradicionales del pensamiento. En su análisis, los grandes hoteles norteamericanos representan para él un símbolo del progreso moderno: edificios monumentales que combinan alojamiento, comida, ocio y trabajo bajo una administración racionalizada. Sarmiento interpreta estos hoteles como una materialización práctica de los falansterios soñados por el pensador socialista Charles Fourier, aunque s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sarmiento-y-el-hotel-como-modelo-de-la-sociedad-moderna</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sarmiento-y-el-hotel-como-modelo-de-la-sociedad-moderna</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La revista Ayer recibe reconocimiento por calidad y prácticas de igualdad de género]]></title><description><![CDATA[La revista Ayer, publicación de la Asociación de Historia Contemporánea, ha sido recientemente galardonada con el Sello de Calidad de la FECYT, un reconocimiento que certifica la excelencia científica y editorial de la revista.

Según FACUA, estos gastos no responden a un servicio adicional solicitado por los usuarios, sino que forman parte de los costes operativos normales de la empresa, lo que constituye un sobrecoste injustificado. Además, las entradas 'Platinum' se fijan mediante un sistema de precios dinámicos que varían según la oferta y la demanda, sin ofrecer ningún beneficio extra al comprador, lo que la asociación considera una práctica abusiva.

El estudio, que analizó datos de 37 investigaciones que incluyeron más de 9300 adultos con sobrepeso u obesidad, observó un patrón constante: al suspender la medicación, los pacientes aumentan de media unos 400 gramos al mes. Este incremento sostenido hace que, en aproximadamente un año y medio o dos, la báscula vuelva a mostrar valores similares a los iniciales antes del tratamiento.

Los medicamentos más recientes, como la semaglutida (Ozempic, Wegovy) y la tirzepatida (Mounjaro), provocan una pérdida de peso inicial más pronunciada, pero también una recuperación más rápida una vez se suspenden.

En una charla sobre costumbres, un argentino bromeó despectivamente sobre la incomodidad de comer con palillos, considerándolos primitivos e ineficientes. Una chica japonesa replicó que en Japón no solo era cómodo usarlos, sino que estaba mal visto comer con cuchillo y tenedor, especialmente el cuchillo, por asociarse a un arma peligrosa. Para ilustrarlo, comparó poner un cuchillo en la mesa con colocar una pistola ante un huésped: ambos generan amenaza innecesaria.

A partir de un comentario de Borges registrado por Bioy Casares en 1958 —sobre una invitación al teatro Colón que rechaza para no alquilar frac—, el autor muestra cómo el escritor argentino construía un chiste donde la timidez o modestia se transforma en ingenio. Décadas después, Piglia utiliza un mecanismo parecido al relatar una supuesta anécdota entre Borges y Vargas Llosa, en la que Borges responde con ironía a una observación sobre su vivienda modesta.

La cinta abre con una escena sencilla pero perturbadora: una madre médica pincha a su hija con una aguja. No se trata de un terror explícito, sino de un miedo cultural, familiar y emocional que conecta con la huella del sida de los años 80 y 90. Sin nombrar la enfermedad, Ducournau muestra cómo el estigma y el pánico de aquella época moldearon una manera de amar vigilante y una afectividad marcada por la sospecha. La madre, traumatizada por su experiencia en hospitales colapsados, convierte su cuidado en obsesión; la hija, Alfa, interioriza ese miedo hasta creer que está enferma. En casa y en la escuela, todos actúan como si lo estuviera, reproduciendo el aislamiento y el silencio del pasado.

Subraya la diferencia entre eliminar y erradicar: mientras la erradicación supondría la desaparición total del problema, la eliminación implicaría simplemente su control; y, según él, España aún está lejos de ambas metas.

Peralta lamenta la falta histórica de formación antidopaje entre los deportistas y reivindica una educación más temprana y transparente sobre la integridad y los riesgos del dopaje.

Musetti explica que, desde sus primeros pasos en el circuito, se le comparó con Jannik Sinner y Carlos Alcaraz como parte de una nueva generación llamada a suceder a Nadal, Federer y Djokovic. Reconoce, sin embargo, que no manejó tan bien la presión como sus compañeros, lo que afectó a su continuidad en los resultados.

El jugador recuerda sus comienzos en una familia humilde, donde el tenis nació como un juego compartido con su padre. Su dedicación le llevó pronto a despuntar entre los jóvenes, combinando los estudios con el deporte gracias al apoyo de su madre. Musetti relata cómo su primera victoria en el circuito ATP fue un punto de inflexión: le dio confianza, pero también lo expuso a una presión mediática para la que no ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lorenzo-musetti-reflexiona-sobre-la-presion-la-consistencia-y-su-madurez-en-la-elite-del-tenis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lorenzo-musetti-reflexiona-sobre-la-presion-la-consistencia-y-su-madurez-en-la-elite-del-tenis</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Talavera denuncia ante la Fiscalía el disparo mortal a un gato en dependencias municipales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Talavera de la Reina ha presentado ante la Fiscalía el caso de la muerte de un gato perteneciente a una colonia felina municipal, hallado con un disparo en la base del cráneo dentro de instalaciones municipales.

Las cámaras de seguridad registraron un vehículo detenido brevemente en el lugar de los hechos, cuyas imágenes ya han sido entregadas junto con el resto de pruebas a las autoridades para su investigación. González recordó que la Ley 7/2023 de protección animal prohíbe el maltrato y la muerte intencionada de animales, y que estos hechos podrían constituir un delito de maltrato con agravante del uso de armas, según el Código Penal.

La negativa se produjo durante una reunión celebrada en la Casa Blanca con representantes de ambos gobiernos, entre ellos el ministro de Exteriores danés, Lars Rasmussen.

El encuentro estuvo marcado por un desacuerdo de fondo que, según reconoció el propio Rasmussen, sigue sin resolverse. Horas antes de la reunión, Trump reforzó públicamente su postura al afirmar en Truth Social que cualquier solución que no implique el control estadounidense de Groenlandia resulta “inaceptable”. El presidente ha convertido la adquisición de la isla en una prioridad estratégica y no ha descartado explícitamente el uso de la fuerza militar, lo que ha generado una fuerte reacción diplomática.

El siniestro tuvo lugar en la provincia de Nakhon Ratchasima, cuando la estructura metálica cayó sobre el convoy en marcha, provocando su descarrilamiento y un posterior incendio.

Según informaron las autoridades locales y el Ministerio de Salud tailandés, un total de 64 personas tuvieron que ser hospitalizadas, de las cuales al menos siete se encuentran en estado grave. El tren, que cubría la ruta entre Bangkok y la provincia de Ubon Ratchathani, transportaba a cerca de 195 pasajeros en el momento del accidente. Los equipos de emergencia acudieron rápidamente al lugar tras recibir el aviso, desplegando labores de rescate entre los restos del tren, que quedó volcado y rodeado de humo y escombros.

En el deporte de fuerza y el culturismo, esta tendencia ha alcanzado niveles extremos, con dietas que duplican o triplican las recomendaciones oficiales. Aunque la proteína es un nutriente esencial para el desarrollo muscular y la recuperación, su exceso puede tener efectos nocivos sobre la función renal, especialmente si se mantiene durante largos periodos. 

Un estudio dirigido por Alberto de Lorenzo, Andrew S. Bomback y Niko Mihic, publicado en la revista *Sports Medicine*, revisa la evidencia científica disponible y concluye que una ingesta elevada y mantenida de proteínas puede provocar un estado de hiperfiltración glomerular: una adaptación del riñón que inicialmente parece beneficiosa, pero que, a largo plazo, puede conllevar inflamación y pérdida progresiva de función renal.

Guillamón no busca una simple matización de la interpretación del historiador británico, sino una ruptura entre dos concepciones del pasado que considera irreconciliables: la historiografía de Estado, orientada a la legitimación de la República y el orden burgués, y la historiografía revolucionaria, centrada en la lucha de clases, la revolución social y la contrarrevolución estalinista. Según el autor, Preston representa el paradigma institucional que presenta la revolución de 1936 como un error o un estorbo, subordinando toda lectura de la guerra a la legalidad republicana y al fetichismo del Estado.

Además, se alojaban en instalaciones precarias, insalubres y sin las condiciones mínimas de higiene o comodidad.

La polémica surge porque la distancia entre ambas ciudades es de unas dos horas y media por carretera, lo que muchos aficionados han considerado un desplazamiento demasiado corto para justificar el uso de un avión. En las redes sociales, numerosos usuarios reprocharon al club su falta de sensibilidad ambiental y lo consideraron un gesto innecesario, especialmente en un momento en el que se promueve reducir las emisiones contaminantes. Comentarios irónicos como “el jet lag puede ser brutal” o “Albacete en avión, qué vergüenza de club” reflejan el tono general de las críticas.

Testimonios recogidos por el diario revelan que los agentes cortan la electricidad durante las manifestaciones nocturnas para disparar a los participantes con armas de guerra. Posteriormente, los cuerpos son retirados en camiones y las familias deben pagar lo que el régimen denomina el 'precio de las balas' para recuperar los cadáveres de sus seres queridos. 

Entre las víctimas se encuentran Nika y María, dos mujeres jóvenes que desafiaban la obligatoriedad del velo en Teherán. Mediss Tavakoli, una psicoterapeuta iraní exiliada en España, denuncia que solo entre sus conocidos hay al menos 20 muertos, y que los vídeos que circulan desde el país muestran morgues desbordadas y cuerpos sin identificar.

A pesar de contar con varias ausencias importantes, entre ellas Kylian Mbappé, Jude Bellingham y Thibaut Courtois, Arbeloa optó por dar oportunidades a varios jugadores del filial, pero el equipo no consiguió rendir al nivel esperado.

El Albacete, que llevaba cinco partidos sin ganar, se adelantó con un gol de Javier Villar antes del descanso.

En los hogares de señores acomodados, realizaban tareas esenciales como cocinar, limpiar, lavar ropa y cuidar niños, a menudo en condiciones de explotación y dependencia total de sus amos. Vivían en las casas donde servían, con salarios modestos que solían destinarse a su dote para un futuro matrimonio, aunque muchas permanecían solteras toda la vida. Nausia destaca las violencias que sufrían: abusos sexuales por parte de los amos, castigos físicos injustos, falsas acusaciones que las llevaban a la cárcel o expulsión sin paga, y un control absoluto sobre su vida privada.

Las denunciantes aseguran haber sufrido abusos sexuales y condiciones laborales degradantes, tanto en su residencia de la República Dominicana como en las Bahamas. La Fiscalía de la Audiencia Nacional española ha comenzado a analizar la denuncia y a recopilar información de los hechos, que podrían constituir delitos de trata de seres humanos con fines de servidumbre, agresión sexual y vulneración de derechos laborales. 

Según la periodista Paloma García-Pelayo, próxima al entorno del artista, Iglesias está profundamente afectado por el impacto mediático y teme por el deterioro de su reputación internacional. Fuentes cercanas al cantante afirman que mantiene un “silencio absoluto” mientras su defensa legal prepara su estrategia.

El suceso tuvo lugar la noche del miércoles, en un contexto especialmente sensible para la ciudad tras el reciente tiroteo mortal de Renee Good a manos de un agente del ICE la semana anterior.

De acuerdo con el comunicado oficial, los agentes realizaban una parada de tráfico “dirigida” cuando el hombre, que según el DHS se encontraba en situación administrativa irregular, huyó en su vehículo. Tras chocar contra un coche estacionado, continuó la fuga a pie. Un agente logró alcanzarlo e intentó detenerlo, momento en el que, siempre según la versión oficial, el sospechoso se resistió y agredió violentamente al funcionario.

Durante el forcejeo, dos personas salieron de un edificio cercano y atacaron al agente con una pala para nieve y el mango de una esco]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-inmigrante-venezolano-resulta-herido-por-disparos-de-un-agente-federal-durante-una-detencion-en-minneapolis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-inmigrante-venezolano-resulta-herido-por-disparos-de-un-agente-federal-durante-una-detencion-en-minneapolis</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El eclipse solar total de 2026: un evento histórico visible desde media España]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Diego González en el blog Fronteras relata la expectación que rodea el eclipse total de Sol que se producirá el 12 de agosto de 2026, el primero visible desde gran parte de España en más de dos décadas.

La franja de totalidad cruzará la mitad norte del país, abarcando 28 provincias y 22 capitales, y alcanzando una población estimada de unos 14 millones de personas. Ciudades como Valencia y Zaragoza estarán completamente dentro de la zona de oscuridad total, mientras que Madrid y Barcelona quedarán fuera por escasos kilómetros, aunque en algunas zonas próximas se podrá disfrutar parcialmente de la totalidad durante unos segundos.

Este índice se basa en la observación de picos inusuales en los pedidos de comida, especialmente pizza, en zonas cercanas a centros clave de poder como el Pentágono, lo que se interpreta como señal de jornadas de trabajo intensivo vinculadas a crisis o decisiones sensibles.

El artículo sitúa este fenómeno en un escenario internacional especialmente delicado. En Irán se registran protestas masivas, una respuesta represiva por parte de las autoridades y un aumento de la retórica hostil entre Teherán y Washington.

En una intervención desde Vigo, Pontón ha reprochado al Partido Popular sus políticas sanitarias durante los últimos 16 años, que, según ella, han derivado en el actual colapso tanto en los hospitales como en la Atención Primaria. La líder nacionalista ha denunciado que cientos de pacientes se ven obligados a esperar horas en los pasillos y que, en muchos centros, las citas con el médico de cabecera se retrasan más de tres semanas. 

Pontón ha puesto de relieve las denuncias de los coordinadores de Urgencias Hospitalarias, quienes alertan de una sobrecarga asistencial y escasez de profesionales.

El suceso ocurrió en un barrio residencial y provocó protestas inmediatas de los transeúntes, que denunciaron el uso excesivo de la fuerza. Según testigos, los agentes irrumpieron en su vehículo y la arrastraron al suelo mientras ella pedía auxilio. Durante el altercado, las fuerzas federales emplearon gases lacrimógenos, granadas aturdidoras y proyectiles de pimienta contra los manifestantes.

Esta acumulación se debe a las intervenciones del banco para evitar una apreciación excesiva del franco suizo, considerado tradicionalmente un activo refugio en tiempos de incertidumbre. La fortaleza de la divisa ha sido constante, lo que obligó al BNS a comprar grandes cantidades de activos extranjeros —como acciones de empresas estadounidenses o bonos del Tesoro de EE. UU.— a cambio de emitir francos suizos. Este proceso generó un crecimiento notable en las reservas internacionales del país. 

El asunto ha abierto un debate político y económico dentro de Suiza.

Forti identifica un cambio estructural donde el orden liberal internacional, vigente desde la Segunda Guerra Mundial, cede ante una lógica neoimperial caracterizada por la competencia de potencias, la fragmentación de bloques hemisféricos y la pérdida de autoridad de las instituciones multilaterales. Según el autor, este nuevo sistema recuerda al imperialismo del siglo XIX, aunque reconfigurado por la hegemonía tecnológica y militar de las élites globales. 

El texto sostiene que el neoliberalismo, con su énfasis en el individualismo y la desregulación, allanó el camino a formas de autoritarismo y populismo de derechas, vaciando la democracia de su componente social y concentrando el poder en élites económicas y tecnológicas.

El mandatario ha reiterado su deseo de que Estados Unidos adquiera el control del territorio, actualmente bajo soberanía danesa, al que incluso ha llegado a poner un precio de 700.000 millones de dólares. Estas declaraciones han generado malestar en la Unión Europea, cuyos líderes han condenado lo que consideran una violación del Derecho internacional y una afrenta a la soberanía danesa. Dinamarca, por su parte, ha informado que reforzará su presencia militar en la isla con más tropas, barcos y aviones, una medida coordinada con sus aliados de la OTAN.

Según el ministro de Exteriores danés, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, las posturas siguen siendo muy diferentes: Copenhague y Nuuk están dispuestos a cooperar en seguridad con Washington, pero rechazan de plano cualquier cesión de soberanía. La representante de Exteriores de Groenlandia, Vivian Motzfeldt, reafirmó que desean colaborar, pero sin convertirse en parte de Estados Unidos.

Antes de la reunión, Dinamarca anunció un incremento de su presencia militar en la isla y una extensión de las maniobras coordinadas con la OTAN, con el objetivo de fortalecer la seguridad en el Ártico.

UU. y de que él mismo asumiera el cargo de gobernador. La broma, realizada ante miembros del Congreso estadounidense y recogida por Politico, se produjo en el contexto de su reciente nominación como representante diplomático en Reikiavik.

Billy Long es un excongresista republicano por el estado de Misuri y una figura cercana al expresidente Donald Trump. Su trayectoria reciente ha estado marcada por la polémica, ya que en agosto del año anterior fue destituido como director del Servicio de Impuestos Internos (IRS), puesto para el que había sido nombrado apenas dos meses antes pese a no contar con experiencia relevante en materia fiscal. El mismo día de su cese se anunció su candidatura como embajador en Islandia.

En este contexto, múltiples testimonios y grabaciones muestran a agentes federales utilizando el caso como amenaza directa hacia los manifestantes. En varios vídeos, los agentes aluden a 'aprender la lección' o advierten a los ciudadanos que 'vuelvan con sus hijos', interpretaciones claras de intimidación que muchos ven como una referencia al uso reciente de fuerza letal. 

Durante las protestas, los agentes de ICE y la Patrulla Fronteriza han desplegado tácticas violentas: uso de gases lacrimógenos, pulverización de gas pimienta, destrucción de vehículos y detenciones agresivas. Estas acciones se enmarcan en la llamada 'Operación Metro Surge', una iniciativa del presidente Donald Trump que ha desplegado miles de agentes federales en el estado bajo el pretexto de combatir el fraude en servicios sociales.

La resolución del Constitucional, adoptada por 10 votos a 2, declara nulas las decisiones de la Mesa y exige que se debatan públicamente en la Asamblea.

En las imágenes, Giménez se muestra visiblemente incómoda y llega a decirle al cantante frases como 'No, Julio, te lo pido... Vos sos un hombre casado', intentando apartarse de sus avances. A pesar de ello, Iglesias la agarra fuertemente y continúa intentando besarla, hasta que la presentadora decide levantarse y cambiar de posición en el plató para poder continuar con la entrevista.

El suceso tuvo lugar apenas unos días después del asesinato de Renee Nicole Good a manos de un agente del mismo cuerpo, lo que ha intensificado el descontento social en el país. En las imágenes se observa a varios agentes fuertemente armados y encapuchados que arrastran a la mujer fuera de su vehículo, mientras ella grita intentando explicar que se dirigía al médico. Los testigos increpan a los agentes por el uso desproporcionado de la fuerza y la falta de humanidad. Según el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, los agentes actuaban en el marco de una operación dirigida contra un ciudadano ecuatoriano, aunque el amplio despliegue policial ha generado más de 60 arrestos en cinco días y ha provocado el cierre de escuelas y comercios.

Según Repsol, principal distribuidor de gas butano en Asturias, no hay desabastecimiento real, pero la combinación de alta demanda y días festivos ha provocado retrasos en la reposición en algunas estaciones de servicio. Además, los propietarios de gasolineras alertan de que la distribución se ha vuelto más rígida, dificultando aún más el reabastecimiento de bombonas, cuyo precio está regulado por el Estado en 15,46 euros por unidad de 12,5 kg. El gas butano llega a Asturias desde la factoría de Santurce, en Vizcaya, y se distribuye a través de tres agencias locales. Este fenómeno afecta tanto al consumo doméstico como al hostelero y también a consumidores jóvenes que recurren a la bombona por conveniencia. Con la subida de las temperaturas, se espera que estos retrasos disminuyan.

La investigación, conocida como 'caso Mascarillas', se inició tras descubrirse en abril de 2020 un contrato irregular para la compra de material sanitario por dos millones de euros, con un sobrecoste de casi un millón. Según el juez, este contrato fue solo una muestra de una dinámica más amplia de amaños y comisiones ilegales que implicarían a altos cargos de la institución, entre ellos su entonces presidente y líder provincial del PP, Javier Aureliano García. El auto judicial autoriza a la Guardia Civil (UCO) a volcar los teléfonos de seis nuevos investigados vinculados a varias empresas que habrían obtenido contratos irregulares, como OYC Servicios Urbanos, Albaida Infraestructuras o Construcciones Nila, entre otras.

Este estudio, publicado en la revista Cell, demuestra que la respuesta inmunitaria frente al virus puede inducir un mecanismo de mimetismo molecular que daña el sistema nervioso central. Los investigadores descubrieron que ciertas células T, al atacar el virus, también reaccionan contra una proteína del cerebro llamada anoctamina-2 (ANO2). Esta reacción cruzada hace que el sistema inmunitario confunda componentes propios del organismo con los del virus, contribuyendo potencialmente al desarrollo de la enfermedad. En las muestras analizadas, las células T reactivas a ambas proteínas (EBNA1 del virus y ANO2) fueron mucho más frecuentes en personas con esclerosis que en individuos sanos.

Este artículo establece la obligación de los Estados miembros de prestar ayuda y apoyo militar ante una agresión externa. Pese a las dudas legales existentes —ya que Groenlandia no forma parte de la Unión, aunque Dinamarca sí lo es—, Bruselas ha enviado un mensaje político claro: la UE respaldará a los groenlandeses si se produce un ataque. 

La advertencia se produce tras los renovados intereses de Donald Trump en el territorio, alegando motivos de seguridad nacional y sin descartar escenarios militares.

La provocadora declaración se produjo después de que Dinamarca anunciara el refuerzo de su presencia militar en Groenlandia, un territorio autónomo del reino danés con una población de apenas 57.000 personas.

El mandatario estadounidense justificó su postura alegando que, si Estados Unidos no incrementa su control en la zona, otras potencias como Rusia o China podrían aprovechar la oportunidad para expandir su influencia en el Ártico.

En concreto, las obras de remodelación de las oficinas de Servicios Generales, con un coste superior a 250.000 euros, se dividieron en ocho contratos menores de menos de 49.000 euros cada uno. Este modo de proceder evitó la obligación de convocar un concurso público, incumpliendo la normativa de contratación. Además, la constructora COMSA, adjudicataria de los trabajos de mantenimiento, habría facturado de forma duplicada servicios ya incluidos en otros contratos, lo que generó pagos adicionales injustificados.

Sin embargo, detrás de ese éxito se esconde una realidad laboral precaria para miles de camareras de piso, conocidas como ‘Las Kellys’. Yolanda García, trabajadora de 56 años en un hotel de Benidorm, explica que recibe solo 1,5 euros por habitación y llega a limpiar hasta 30 al día. Esta situación, común en muchos hoteles, refleja la sobrecarga de trabajo y los bajos salarios que sufre el colectivo. 

El trabajo de las Kellys implica limpiar entre 20 y 30 habitaciones en jornadas teóricamente de ocho horas, aunque en la práctica disponen de solo seis debido al horario de acceso a las habitaciones. Las exigencias del ritmo, el control del tiempo y la ausencia de pausas provocan lesiones crónicas en espalda, manos y hombros, además de un constante cansancio acumulado. A pesar de tratarse de labores físicamente muy duras, pocas veces se reconocen oficialmente como un “trabajo penoso”.

Los especialistas han indicado que, por la intensidad y el tamaño del destello, se trataría de un meteorito de grandes dimensiones que se desintegró al entrar en la atmósfera terrestre. 

La combinación visual entre el resplandor del meteorito y los tonos verdes y violetas de las auroras creó una escena de enorme belleza que ha llamado la atención en todo el mundo. El autor del vídeo, visiblemente emocionado, celebró haber captado un momento tan inusual.

Dinamarca ha desplegado un destacamento militar en la isla ártica, mientras aliados europeos muestran su apoyo a Copenhague y advierten que cualquier acción unilateral por parte de Washington podría poner fin a la OTAN. Trump, que argumenta que Groenlandia es esencial para el desarrollo de un proyecto estratégico denominado «Golden Dome» y para contener la influencia rusa y china en el Ártico, ha afirmado que “la pérdida de Groenlandia sería inaceptable”. En contraste, tanto la primera ministra danesa Mette Frederiksen como el primer ministro groenlandés Jens-Frederik Nielsen han rechazado sus pretensiones, defendiendo la soberanía compartida dentro del Reino de Dinamarca.

La Oficina Nacional Anticorrupción de Ucrania (NABU) ha iniciado un proceso contra un líder político supuestamente identificado como Timoshenko, a quien se acusa de ofrecer beneficios ilícitos a diputados del Parlamento para asegurar su apoyo. En el marco de esta investigación, agentes registraron la sede del partido Batkivshchyna, dirigido por Timoshenko, donde se hallaron sobres con dinero en efectivo. La política negó rotundamente las acusaciones, calificando la operación de maniobra política destinada a dañar su reputación y afirmando que el registro se realizó sin presentar documentación válida.

Según Patrick Pouyanné, director ejecutivo de TotalEnergies, y Darren Woods de ExxonMobil, reactivar la producción petrolera del país no será inmediato, y llevará años y decenas de miles de millones de dólares. Actualmente, Venezuela produce alrededor de un millón de barriles diarios, lejos de su pico histórico de casi 4 millones en los años 70. Para alcanzar cifras superiores a 3 millones de barriles diarios sería necesario reconstruir o reemplazar plataformas abandonadas, reparar ductos dañados y asegurar marcos legales claros que garanticen la seguridad de las inversiones y de los empleados. Aunque el expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump ha instado a las petroleras a regresar tras la caída de Nicolás Maduro, los ejecutivos muestran cautela y consideran que Venezuela no será relevante para el mercado global en 2026.

Según los testimonios recogidos, las mujeres relatan un ambiente de control extremo, humillaciones y agresiones sexuales reiteradas por parte del artista, que habría llegado a tratarlas como esclavas y a someterlas a pruebas médicas para comprobar si estaban embarazadas o padecían infecciones de transmisión sexual. 
La investigación, de carácter internacional, ha llevado a la Fiscalía a abrir diligencias por la gravedad de los hechos descritos.

Durante una reunión del Consejo de Ministros francés, Macron subrayó que Francia no subestima las declaraciones estadounidenses sobre la isla ártica y que París actuará en 'total solidaridad' con Copenhague para defender su integridad territorial. Esta postura llega poco después de que Trump justificara la necesidad de Groenlandia para la seguridad nacional de Estados Unidos, describiéndola como esencial para su proyecto de 'Cúpula Dorada', un escudo antimisiles similar al de Israel, y afirmando que fortalecería a la OTAN bajo control estadounidense, pese a que Dinamarca ya es miembro de la Alianza.

Pese a los intentos de la víctima por mantener la distancia por respeto a su superior, el policía le tocó el pecho sin su consentimiento cuando ella se despedía del grupo. La agresión fue presenciada por al menos un compañero, que intervino para recriminarle el comportamiento, lo que provocó un enfrentamiento entre ambos y requirió la intervención de un tercer agente.

El tribunal ha considerado que estas actividades eran incompatibles con la recuperación de la lesión y demostraban aptitud para trabajar, vulnerando así la buena fe contractual. Durante el periodo de baja, el empleado incluso llegó a ser hospitalizado brevemente tras una de esas salidas, aunque se reincorporó a la bicicleta días después de recibir el alta médica por ese episodio.

El Juzgado de Primera Instancia número 100 de Madrid ha emitido la orden de lanzamiento para este miércoles a las 13.00 horas en la calle Dolorosa, número 14. Tras la muerte de su madre a manos de su pareja, los niños quedaron bajo el cuidado de su abuela, que sobrevive con apenas 600 euros mensuales procedentes de trabajos esporádicos de limpieza y cuidado. La familia vive en una situación de extrema vulnerabilidad, sin otra red de apoyo ni recursos suficientes para pagar su vivienda. El desahucio ha sido promovido por la sociedad limitada Circleville SL, empresa inmobiliaria que adquirió la deuda hipotecaria de la familia hace años. Pese a los reiterados intentos de Victoria por aplazar el lanzamiento alegando su situación económica y la presencia de menores víctimas de violencia m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-abuela-y-sus-dos-nietos-huerfanos-por-violencia-machista-enfrentan-un-desahucio-en-villaverde</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-abuela-y-sus-dos-nietos-huerfanos-por-violencia-machista-enfrentan-un-desahucio-en-villaverde</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Azafatas de Iran Air antes de la Revolución Iraní de 1979]]></title><description><![CDATA[Antes de la Revolución Islámica de 1979, Iran Air se había convertido en un símbolo de modernidad y ambición internacional en Irán. La aerolínea destacaba por su lujo, profesionalismo y sofisticación técnica, y sus azafatas eran reflejo de estos valores. Durante las décadas de 1960 y 1970, las uniformes de las azafatas combinaban elegancia occidental con estilo refinado, incluyendo blazers entallados, faldas hasta la rodilla, sombreros tipo pillbox y pañuelos de seda. La formación de estas profesionales era exigente: se requería un alto nivel educativo, fluidez en varios idiomas y, en muchos casos, experiencia internacional. Además, el cargo ofrecía independencia y la posibilidad de viajar al extranjero, algo poco común para muchas mujeres iraníes de la época. Iran Air operaba rutas largas y avanzadas tecnológicamente, incluyendo vuelos directos entre Teherán y Nueva York con aeronaves como el Boeing 747SP.

La temporada de gripe, que este año se adelantó un mes, ha comenzado a remitir con una incidencia de 190,9 casos por cada 100.000 habitantes, pero los ingresos por infecciones respiratorias continúan creciendo levemente. En Galicia, los coordinadores de los Servizos de Urxencias Hospitalarios denuncian un aumento de hasta el 30% en la atención respecto a los picos asistenciales anteriores, junto a una preocupante falta de personal médico y de enfermería. La Sociedad Española de Medicina de Urgencias y Emergencias (SEMES) respalda estas quejas y advierte que el problema se prolonga desde hace años, con un sistema sanitario tensionado hasta límites insostenibles. La SEMES subraya además el papel crucial del personal de enfermería, que mantiene el sistema operativo pese a plantillas insuficientes y un claro déficit estructural.

Los hechos ocurrieron tras una semana de búsqueda, cuando el sospechoso fue localizado en un piso de la avenida Madrid, en el barrio zaragozano de Las Delicias, donde se había ocultado desde que las víctimas lograron escapar. La denunciante, una mujer de unos veinte años, consiguió abandonar el domicilio el 6 de enero aprovechando que el agresor dormía, y al día siguiente acudió con su hija al hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, donde fueron atendidas por lesiones calificadas de 'extrema gravedad'. La víctima presentó denuncia en la comisaría de Delicias el 8 de enero y aportó los informes médicos, lo que llevó a la activación del protocolo policial correspondiente y a su inclusión en el nivel de riesgo extremo del sistema Viogén.

El acuerdo, cerrado en diciembre tras intensas negociaciones, prevé que Kiev solo devuelva el dinero cuando Rusia indemnice por los daños causados por la guerra. El nuevo plan introduce una cláusula clave: Ucrania deberá utilizar los fondos militares para fabricar armamento propio o para adquirirlo en países de la Unión Europea. Solo podrá comprar fuera, por ejemplo a Estados Unidos, si demuestra que Europa no puede ofrecer el material necesario con la rapidez o las características adecuadas.

La declaración se produjo durante los Desayunos Deportivos de Europa Press, donde Tebas insistió en que la piratería debe erradicarse por completo y defendió que el precio del fútbol no es el principal motivo del consumo ilegal, al estar integrado en paquetes con otros contenidos.

Según Tebas, LaLiga continuará intensificando su ofensiva contra lo que denomina organizaciones mafiosas de la piratería y también contra grandes tecnológicas que, a su juicio, la facilitan. En este contexto, agradeció la colaboración institucional recibida y dejó claro que el fenómeno del uso de VPN para eludir bloqueos es creciente y no puede ignorarse. Aunque no detalló en qué consistirá la futura resolución, sus palabras han generado inquietud entre usuarios y expertos en redes.

La manifestación, celebrada coincidiendo con el Día Internacional de la Mujer, reunió a mujeres de distintos ámbitos —estudiantes, enfermeras, madres y trabajadoras— que defendían las libertades conquistadas durante las décadas anteriores bajo el régimen del sah. Con la llegada al poder del Ayatolá Jomeini, muchas de esas libertades fueron eliminadas: se derogó la Ley de Protección de la Familia de 1967, se impuso el código de vestimenta islámico en el trabajo, las mujeres fueron apartadas de la judicatura y se instauró la segregación por sexo en playas, escuelas y espacios públicos.

En respuesta a unas declaraciones en las que Nielsen aseguró que su territorio prefería mantener sus lazos con Dinamarca, Trump replicó con desprecio afirmando que no sabía quién era el dirigente y que 'iba a tener un gran problema'. Según el mandatario estadounidense, poseer Groenlandia sería vital para la seguridad nacional de EE. UU. ante posibles amenazas de Rusia y China.
El conflicto se agrava por un informe del 'Daily Mail' que sostiene que Trump habría pedido al Comando Conjunto de Operaciones Especiales (JSOC) un plan de invasión de la isla.

El texto examina cómo la autora sevillana recupera el ritmo clásico del endecasílabo y lo dota de nueva vida en un contexto poético contemporáneo, reivindicando la musicalidad, la precisión y la emoción frente al verso libre desordenado que predomina en parte de la poesía actual. La crítica destaca la maestría técnica de León y su capacidad para combinar reflexión filosófica y sensibilidad emocional, presentando la poesía como un viaje interior en busca de la verdad, la autenticidad y la belleza. A través de referencias a autores como Dante, Cernuda, Machado y Rimbaud, Navarro sitúa la obra en una tradición literaria que explora la relación entre la luz y la sombra, la vida y la muerte, el amor como fuerza redentora y el yo poético como héroe en tránsito hacia el conocimiento.

El texto destaca que la relación entre Iglesias y el PP incluye numerosos acuerdos y contratos públicos.

La entidad heredó el expediente de Bankia, a la que absorbió hace cinco años, y ha recurrido la sanción ante el Tribunal Supremo. La operación de la Torre Foster se remonta a 2007, cuando Caja Madrid adquirió el edificio por más de 800 millones de euros, poco antes de la crisis financiera que afectó gravemente al sector inmobiliario español. Años más tarde, Bankia, sucesora de Caja Madrid, vendió la torre a Muscary Property, una sociedad controlada por el jeque emiratí Khadem al Qubaisi, entonces presidente de Cepsa.

Explica que el gerrymandering otorga decenas de escaños adicionales en la Cámara de Representantes a los republicanos, mientras que el desequilibrio del Senado —donde estados con millones de habitantes tienen el mismo peso que otros con apenas cientos de miles— amplifica aún más el poder de las minorías rurales conservadoras.

Uclés defiende que fueron las mujeres las verdaderas sostenedoras del país durante la guerra y la posguerra, al soportar las pérdidas, la represión y las cargas familiares en un contexto dominado por el machismo. En su familia, explica, las mujeres han tenido siempre el papel central en la toma de decisiones, algo que asocia con las estructuras rurales tradicionales de Andalucía. Durante la entrevista, critica la visión impuesta por el franquismo a través de figuras como Pilar Primo de Rivera y su 'guía de la buena esposa', que consolidó un modelo de mujer sumisa al servicio del hombre. Uclés contrasta esa figura con referentes republicanas como Maruja Mallo, María Zambrano o Mercè Rodoreda, cuyas trayectorias representan resistencia, libert]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/david-ucles-reflexiona-sobre-las-mujeres-en-la-guerra-civil-el-franquismo-y-la-persistencia-del-machismo-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/david-ucles-reflexiona-sobre-las-mujeres-en-la-guerra-civil-el-franquismo-y-la-persistencia-del-machismo-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El nuevo Abono Único de transporte estatal permitirá viajar por España por 60 euros al mes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde el 12 de enero de 2026, ya se puede adquirir el nuevo Abono Único impulsado por el Ministerio de Transportes y Movilidad Sostenible.

El empleado, respaldado por el sindicato United Auto Workers (UAW), gritó a Trump llamándole 'protector de pedófilos', en alusión a sus vínculos con Jeffrey Epstein y a los retrasos del FBI en la publicación de los archivos relacionados con el caso. La situación fue captada en vídeo y rápidamente se viralizó, mostrando al presidente respondiendo con un gesto obsceno y una palabra malsonante antes de alejarse. 

Según confirmó el sindicato, el trabajador ha sido suspendido mientras Ford investiga el suceso, aunque no se ha precisado la duración de la sanción. Varios representantes demócratas, como Rashida Tlaib y Debbie Dingell, han expresado su preocupación por el posible atentado a la libertad de expresión del empleado y han pedido explicaciones a la compañía.

Se trata de la tercera causa judicial abierta contra el Gobierno andaluz de Juan Manuel Moreno en esta legislatura por supuestos fraudes en la contratación pública. La causa se origina en una querella del PSOE, que denuncia un posible uso abusivo de contratos menores y prórrogas sin concurso público para favorecer a las mismas empresas. El juez José Luis Rodríguez Lainz investiga posibles delitos de prevaricación administrativa, falsedad documental y fraude en la contratación pública.

Este medio ha ofrecido visibilidad mediática al activista de extrema derecha Bertrand Ndongo, replicando estrategias similares a las utilizadas con Vito Quiles en EDA TV. Los contratos, generalmente inferiores a 15.000 euros, se han adjudicado a dedo sin concurso público, favoreciendo a medios afines al PP frente a otros con mayor alcance, como 'El Salto', que en varios periodos ha triplicado o cuadruplicado la audiencia de 'Periodista Digital' sin recibir financiación pública.

Según varios médicos, los hospitales están colapsados y faltan sangre y suministros médicos, lo que obliga a tratar a los heridos incluso en el exterior de los centros. Los profesionales de la salud afirman que las fuerzas de seguridad apuntan deliberadamente a la cabeza y los ojos de los manifestantes, repitiendo tácticas ya empleadas durante las protestas de 2022 por el movimiento ‘Mujer, Vida, Libertad’. Muchas de las víctimas han quedado ciegas o han perdido los ojos tras ser alcanzadas por perdigones o balas. Las manifestaciones, iniciadas el 28 de diciembre por la caída del valor de la moneda, se han convertido en el mayor movimiento antigubernamental desde 2009.

Los tribunales no han concretado aún la fecha exacta, pero han confirmado que el proceso judicial tendrá lugar después de las elecciones autonómicas y generales previstas para mayo de ese año. Fuentes judiciales han explicado que la decisión se debe a la elevada carga de trabajo derivada de la aplicación de la llamada 'reforma Bolaños', una ley de eficiencia de la Justicia que transforma los actuales juzgados en tribunales de instancia. Esta reestructuración ha saturado el calendario judicial, impidiendo la celebración del juicio en 2026.

Las dimisiones, adelantadas por el periódico local *Minnesota Star-Tribune* y confirmadas por otros medios como *The New York Times*, responden a la negativa de los fiscales a formar parte de una investigación considerada parcial y políticamente motivada.

También afirmó que los precios estaban bajando y que los alimentos estaban volviendo a ser más baratos, aunque los datos oficiales reflejan un incremento del 0,7% mensual en diciembre, el más alto en tres años. En materia de política fiscal, Trump sostuvo erróneamente que había eliminado los impuestos sobre la Seguridad Social para los mayores, cuando en realidad solo se aprobó una deducción temporal que no beneficia a todos los pensionistas.

A las mujeres se les prometía una relación sentimental, alojamiento y trabajo en España, lo que las llevó a aceptar el viaje.

Una vez en Vigo, la realidad fue muy distinta a lo prometido. Las víctimas no disponían de contrato ni permiso de trabajo y se vieron obligadas a residir en una infravivienda situada en un almacén, en condiciones insalubres. Desde allí, eran trasladadas a fruterías y tiendas de alimentación donde trabajaban jornadas extremadamente largas, desde las cuatro y media de la madrugada hasta las nueve de la noche, superando con creces las 16 horas diarias.

En las imágenes, compartidas inicialmente por el medio TMZ, se observa a Trump reaccionar de forma airada ante los gritos de un trabajador, al que responde con un insulto verbal y un gesto obsceno antes de continuar su recorrido saludando al resto del público.

Según las informaciones publicadas, el empleado habría gritado 'protector de pedófilos' al presidente, en alusión al caso de Jeffrey Epstein, el financiero condenado por delitos sexuales y fallecido en prisión. La referencia se enmarca en la polémica generada por la publicación parcial de documentos relacionados con Epstein, difundidos por la propia Administración Trump con numerosas partes censuradas, lo que ha provocado críticas y sospechas entre sectores de la opinión pública.

Esta iniciativa, que ya fue rechazada en noviembre de 2025 por los votos en contra del PP, Vox y Junts, así como por la abstención del PSOE, busca frenar la especulación y el aumento de los precios del alquiler derivado de la acumulación de propiedades por parte de grandes corporaciones. Según explicó el diputado de Compromís, Alberto Ibáñez, el reciente anuncio del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump —que pretende prohibir a grandes inversores la compra de viviendas unifamiliares en su país— podría influir en la posición de PP y Vox, quienes hasta ahora se habían opuesto a la medida. Ibáñez subrayó que la propuesta de Sumar es similar a la planteada por Trump, señalando que Vox ha expresado simpatía hacia la idea, y sugirió que el líder popular Alberto Núñez Feijóo podría seguir la l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-reintroduce-su-ley-para-vetar-la-compra-de-viviendas-por-empresas-y-fondos-de-inversion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-reintroduce-su-ley-para-vetar-la-compra-de-viviendas-por-empresas-y-fondos-de-inversion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 08:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joven española se muda al bosque y vive con bajo coste, priorizando el tiempo sobre el dinero]]></title><description><![CDATA[María, una joven española, decidió abandonar la ciudad tras la pandemia de COVID-19 y mudarse a una casa abandonada en el bosque, que adquirió por solo 6.000 euros y ha ido restaurando poco a poco. Su estilo de vida refleja un cambio profundo en su manera de entender el trabajo y el valor del tiempo. Para ella, la riqueza no se mide en dinero, sino en libertad y autonomía, dedicando diariamente pequeñas cantidades de esfuerzo físico para mejorar su hogar sin la presión de plazos o alquiler de herramientas. La vivienda está conectada a un manantial que le cuesta únicamente 6 euros al año, y complementa su suministro con placas solares, adaptando su consumo de electricidad a la meteorología.

Según documentos internos y reportes del New York Times, la agencia dejará de cuantificar el valor económico de las vidas humanas salvadas al regular contaminantes como las partículas finas (PM2.5) y el ozono. Durante décadas, la EPA ha estimado que estas regulaciones previenen miles de muertes prematuras y cientos de miles de días laborales perdidos cada año, asignando un valor monetario a los beneficios para la salud de la población. Con la nueva política, solo se considerarán los costes que las empresas tendrían que asumir para cumplir con las normas, ignorando el impacto directo sobre la salud de los ciudadanos. Expertos y defensores ambientales han denunciado esta medida como una traición a la misión de la EPA, que históricamente buscaba proteger tanto la salud pública como el medio ambiente.

El caso se remonta a agosto de 2025, cuando un hombre de 69 años utilizó los servicios del acusado para desplazarse desde un hotel hasta la estación de Pontevedra. Tras abonar el precio de la carrera —53 euros—, el cliente realizó un Bizum de 3 euros y entregó un billete de 50, puesto que el conductor no tenía cambio. Días más tarde, el mismo cliente envió accidentalmente otro Bizum, de 35,20 euros, destinado en realidad a un amigo con el mismo nombre que el taxista. El destinatario del dinero, pese a los repetidos mensajes y solicitudes de devolución, nunca respondió ni reembolsó la cantidad. Ante esta situación, el afectado presentó una denuncia ante la Guardia Civil.

El gobierno iraní cortó el acceso a internet y las comunicaciones durante varios días, lo que ha dificultado enormemente el recuento y la confirmación de los hechos. Algunos vídeos difundidos muestran decenas o incluso cientos de cuerpos amontonados en una morgue cercana a Teherán, con heridas supuestamente provocadas por disparos y otros actos de violencia. 

Las protestas comenzaron en respuesta al aumento del coste de la vida y rápidamente se extendieron por todo el país, convirtiéndose en una expresión generalizada contra el régimen islámico. Mientras medios independientes y activistas hablan de una represión sin precedentes, las autoridades iraníes han acusado a 'terroristas' y actores extranjeros de incitar la violencia.

Durante el ensayo, el dispositivo generó 385 kilovatios-hora en apenas 30 minutos, consiguiendo además conectarse a la red eléctrica por primera vez en su categoría. Este logro marca un hito en la energía renovable, ya que abre la puerta a un modelo energético resistente, portátil y con bajo impacto ambiental.

Las familias de los reos deben pagar la cuerda con la que se ahorca al condenado, mostrando el grado extremo de crueldad y coerción. Este método de castigo se ha intensificado en los últimos años, con 97 ejecuciones documentadas en 2024, de las cuales 13 se realizaron en público. Las ejecuciones se realizan en lugares visibles y céntricos, con el objetivo de infundir miedo y disuadir cualquier intento de rebelión.

Considera que el templo se ha convertido en un símbolo de explotación turística y religiosa, alejado del pensamiento contemporáneo y del espíritu artístico del arquitecto modernista. Arnús denomina al edificio 'La Sagrada Mentira' y acusa a los responsables actuales del proyecto de falta de rigor, secretismo y prepotencia, señalando que su manera de proceder supone una traición al método y la filosofía de Gaudí, caracterizados por la innovación y la integración entre arte, estructura y espiritualidad.

A través del caso de Manuel, un vecino obligado a abandonar su hogar tras una subida del alquiler de 300 euros, Tecé retrata una realidad extendida: familias trabajadoras expulsadas de sus barrios por el encarecimiento desmedido de la vivienda. El autor ironiza sobre cómo, pese al crecimiento económico y las cifras optimistas del Gobierno, para la gente común “no da”. 

El texto denuncia la falta de valentía de la izquierda para intervenir el mercado del alquiler y la vivienda turística, mientras la derecha impone tasas turísticas sin reparos, evidenciando la parálisis progresista.

A través de biografías breves y análisis de publicaciones y asociaciones, la autora reconstruye una parte de la historia popular habitualmente ignorada. El libro destaca la conexión entre el librepensamiento, el anticlericalismo, el feminismo y las luchas obreras, mostrando cómo estas corrientes se entrelazaron con el espiritismo racionalista, un movimiento que pretendía unir ciencia, igualdad y libertad social.

Según Domínguez, estos actores económicos compran masivamente viviendas en las grandes capitales españolas —como Madrid o Barcelona—, no para residir en ellas, sino para destinarlas al mercado turístico o mantenerlas vacías como activos financieros. Este fenómeno, afirma, está alterando la vida y la identidad de las ciudades, expulsando a los vecinos tradicionales y transformando los barrios en zonas elitistas o en parques temáticos para visitantes.

Lane, embarazada y sin desear esa unión, fue víctima de un entorno familiar opresivo y religioso que priorizó la 'honra' sobre su bienestar. Décadas después, su experiencia se suma a los datos que revelan que más de 314.000 menores se han casado legalmente entre 2000 y 2021 en EE.UU., según la organización Unchained at Last. Aunque en la actualidad 16 estados y Washington D.C. han prohibido el matrimonio infantil sin excepciones, en otros 34 estados aún existen lagunas legales que permiten que adolescentes, e incluso niños, puedan casarse con consentimiento de sus padres o bajo determinadas circunstancias, como el embarazo. Activistas como Anastasia Law, de Equality Now, denuncian que la]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-infantil-persiste-en-varios-estados-de-ee-uu-pese-a-los-esfuerzos-por-erradicarlo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-infantil-persiste-en-varios-estados-de-ee-uu-pese-a-los-esfuerzos-por-erradicarlo</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tensión diplomática entre EE.

Sarah B. Rogers, subsecretaria de Estado para la Diplomacia Pública e integrante del gobierno de Donald Trump, afirmó que 'nada está fuera de la mesa' si el Reino Unido sigue adelante con la medida. El gobierno británico investiga a X por permitir la difusión de contenidos sexuales generados por inteligencia artificial, incluso posibles casos de abuso infantil, a través de su chatbot Grok. La autoridad reguladora Ofcom está analizando si la plataforma ha incumplido la Ley de Seguridad en Línea británica. 

Rogers acusó al Ejecutivo británico de intentar controlar el espacio público digital para suprimir opiniones políticas contrarias. Además, la congresista republicana Anna Paulina Luna anunció que prepara legislación para sancionar al Reino Unido si finalmente bloquea X.

Según explica, los cuadros ansioso-depresivos están creciendo y presentan particularidades según la edad. En los niños pequeños la depresión puede manifestarse como irritabilidad, apatía, alteraciones del sueño y del apetito o miedos intensos, mientras que en adolescentes los síntomas se asemejan más a los de los adultos: tristeza, aislamiento, falta de disfrute y, en algunos casos, consumo de drogas y pensamientos suicidas. Burgos señala que hasta un tercio de los adolescentes que acuden a Atención Primaria por alteraciones del ánimo podrían padecer depresión.

Abascal ha afirmado que las acusaciones forman parte de una estrategia del Gobierno para desviar la atención de los casos de corrupción, asegurando que el Ejecutivo “solo quiere que se hable de eso”. El dirigente de extrema derecha también ha lamentado lo que considera una proliferación de denuncias contra figuras públicas, incluyendo personas fallecidas como el expresidente Adolfo Suárez. Por su parte, la exdiputada de Vox, Macarena Olona, ha expresado en la red X su apoyo al artista y ha señalado que las acusaciones responden al “#MeToo de la izquierda española”, acusando de hipocresía a un feminismo que, según ella, calla ante los abusos contra mujeres en otros países o cuando los implicados son políticos de izquierdas.

En una entrevista con Radio France Internationale (RFI), Hayer afirmó que esta 'herramienta anticoerción' podría servir como una poderosa palanca política y económica frente a posibles decisiones unilaterales de Washington. La eurodiputada subrayó que Europa no debería temer a Trump ni a posibles represalias, insistiendo en que la UE posee instrumentos de peso en el ámbito financiero y comercial.

En las imágenes, el cantante se abalanza sobre la presentadora para besarla, pero ella lo aparta claramente, mostrando una falta de consentimiento. Este clip ha sido compartido recientemente en redes sociales por Pablo Echenique con el comentario irónico 'No se podía saber', coincidiendo con la noticia de una investigación abierta por la Fiscalía de la Audiencia Nacional contra Iglesias por denuncias de agresión sexual presentadas por dos extrabajadoras de sus mansiones en República Dominicana y Bahamas en 2021. Las denunciantes alegan haber sufrido agresiones físicas y sexuales, y el caso se tramita bajo reserva para proteger a las víctimas.

La protesta culminó con la entrega en el Parlamento de cerca de 190.000 firmas que respaldan la demanda sindical de paralizar una iniciativa que, según los trabajadores, supone un grave retroceso en derechos laborales. La movilización, convocada por la Confederación General de los Trabajadores Portugueses-Intersindical Nacional (CGTP-IN), recorrió el centro de la capital entre cánticos y pancartas que reclamaban mejores salarios, más derechos y una vida digna compatible con el trabajo.

Los sindicatos denuncian que la reforma facilita el despido, amplía la desregulación de los horarios laborales y pone en riesgo derechos consolidados como el permiso de lactancia, lo que consideran una vuelta a condiciones propias de épocas anteriores a los avances sociales del siglo XX.

Microsiervos ha recuperado un folleto técnico de 14 páginas que describe su arquitectura y rendimiento, ofreciendo una mirada detallada a una de las joyas tecnológicas del siglo XX. El Cray-1 incorporaba un procesador de 64 bits a 80 MHz y podía alcanzar un rendimiento de hasta 160 MFLOPS, cifras impresionantes para su época. Contaba con 8 MB de memoria RAM, almacenamiento en disco de 300 MB y un innovador diseño físico en forma de «C» pensado para reducir la longitud de los cables y mejorar la velocidad de transmisión interna. Su sistema de refrigeración con freón líquido y su consumo de 115 kilovatios lo hacían tan complejo como elegante, pesando más de cinco toneladas.

La producción se realiza respetando los ritmos naturales y priorizando la sostenibilidad del ecosistema. 

Para proteger sus colmenas del oso pardo, Adrián ha restaurado un antiguo cortín, una construcción circular de piedra típica del suroccidente asturiano diseñada para evitar que los osos accedan a las colmenas.

Sin embargo, figuras políticas como Yolanda Díaz critican estas medidas, defendiendo que la vivienda es un derecho constitucional y que los incentivos fiscales no abordan la desigualdad entre propietarios e inquilinos.

Testigos presenciales indicaron que el atacante lanzó una piedra desde el exterior que rompió el escaparate del establecimiento.

Un ejemplo representativo es el aire acondicionado Midea Air Horizon M5, que incorpora un chip de IA HiSilicon capaz de aumentar el rendimiento un 700%, integrándose perfectamente en la arquitectura 1+8+n de Huawei, donde el móvil actúa como centro de control del hogar y la vida conectada. 

Una de las claves de este éxito ha sido la apertura del sistema operativo bajo la iniciativa OpenHarmony, gestionada por la fundación OpenAtom.

La primera ministra danesa, Mette Frederiksen, calificó la postura de Washington como inaceptable y recordó la importancia de defender los principios internacionales que impiden cambiar fronteras por la fuerza o mediante la compra de pueblos enteros.

Según estos papeles, fechados en 2024, los EAU estarían dispuestos a respaldar 'por todos los medios necesarios' las acciones israelíes, incluyendo suministros logísticos, inteligencia y presión diplomática en foros internacionales. La propuesta surge en el contexto del conflicto en curso desde octubre de 2023, donde Israel responde al ataque de Hamás con una ofensiva que ha causado decenas de miles de víctimas civiles palestinas y una crisis humanitaria severa. Los documentos sugieren que los EAU buscan contrarrestar la influencia de Irán y Qatar en la región, alineándose con Israel pese a las críticas globales por presuntas violaciones al derecho internacional.

Según la organización, ya se han registrado varios casos de incrementos inasumibles, como el de un piso en Palma cuyo alquiler pasa de 700 a 1.700 euros mensuales. Esta situación está obligando a muchos inquilinos a renunciar a la renovación y buscar alternativas en un mercado inmobiliario altamente tensionado. La PAH estima que las subidas medias de alquiler rondarán los 800 euros este año, afectando a miles de familias en Baleares. De acuerdo con los datos del Ministerio de Consumo, alrededor de 24.500 viviendas en las islas —equivalentes a más de 69.000 personas— verán revisados sus contratos en 2026.

Este incumplimiento legal ha provocado duras críticas de figuras demócratas como Chuck Schumer, quien acusa al Ejecutivo de ocultar los nombres de funcionarios y personalidades influyentes implicadas o mencionadas en los archivos.

Según el autor, la gala, organizada por Ceciarm y en la que se premió a figuras como Vito Quiles, se desarrolló en un ambiente marcado por consignas e insultos dirigidos al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, alentados desde el escenario por algunos intervinientes y coreados por el público. En ese contexto, la presencia de Segura, conocido por su imagen pública de cómico popular y figura supuestamente moderada, es interpretada como un elemento clave para legitimar y normalizar ese entorno ideológico.

El texto sostiene que la retórica de equidistancia defendida por Segura —presentarse como alguien cansado de la polarización entre “fachas y rojos”— acaba situando en el mismo plano a la ultraderecha de raíz franquista y a la izquierda democrática, lo que, en la práctica, contribuye a blanquear]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-al-papel-de-santiago-segura-en-la-normalizacion-cultural-de-la-ultraderecha-digital</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-al-papel-de-santiago-segura-en-la-normalizacion-cultural-de-la-ultraderecha-digital</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un hombre de 80 años detenido en Tenerife tras descubrir que su esposa había fallecido antes del embarque]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un suceso insólito tuvo lugar en el aeropuerto del sur de Tenerife cuando un hombre de 80 años fue detenido tras intentar embarcar en un avión junto a su esposa, que ya había fallecido.

En la práctica, esto habría llevado a que periodistas críticos como Hüseyin Doğru, Alina Lipp, Thomas Röper y Jacques Baud fueran sancionados severamente, incluyendo restricciones sobre sus derechos fundamentales. La estrategia de la UE se centra en considerar la información crítica que desafíe el discurso oficial de la OTAN y la UE sobre conflictos como Ucrania y Palestina como un intento de desestabilización.

Durante un careo ante la jueza con José Manuel Cuenca, exjefe de gabinete de Carlos Mazón, Pradas vinculó por primera vez al expresident con las decisiones tomadas durante la emergencia. Declaró que Cuenca actuaba como una 'extensión del president', transmitiendo órdenes que, según ella, procedían de 'un tercero'. Pradas relató que Cuenca la presionó para frenar el confinamiento de la población durante la crisis, aunque sostuvo que no acató esas indicaciones y que continuó actuando según los criterios de Emergencias y la Ley. La exconsellera insistió en su transparencia, asegurando que no había borrado ningún mensaje de su teléfono, en contraste con Cuenca, quien reconoció haber perdido o sufrido el robo de un móvil corporativo.

Durante el conflicto, Sánchez sirvió como chófer en la 43ª División republicana junto a sus compañeros y amigos Antonio Beltrán 'El Esquinazau' e Hilario Borau. Participó en la Bolsa de Bielsa y en la Batalla del Ebro, donde protagonizó una arriesgada operación de rescate bajo fuego enemigo. Tras el final de la guerra, cruzó a Francia y, durante la ocupación nazi, se incorporó en 1943 al maquis español integrado en la Resistencia francesa, destacando en operaciones de sabotaje y combate en los Pirineos Atlánticos. En 1944, lideró una audaz rendición de tropas alemanas en el puerto de El Portalet, lo que le valió el reconocimiento de la Cruz de Guerra francesa.

Aunque el programa se presentó como una medida pionera para facilitar el acceso a la vivienda, muchos ciudadanos han señalado diversas carencias en los pisos ofertados. En total, se han puesto a disposición 67 viviendas, con la posibilidad de ampliar la oferta próximamente. Sin embargo, los inquilinos han denunciado que muchas de las viviendas no están equipadas: carecen de mobiliario básico, e incluso algunas no tienen la cocina completa, faltando fregaderos o muebles esenciales. 

El modelo de alquiler está pensado para que el importe mensual no supere el 30 % de los ingresos del arrendatario, lo cual excluye a quienes tienen rentas más bajas, ya que los pisos que superan los 355 euros quedan fuera del alcance de quienes cobran el salario mínimo. A la vez, pueden optar al programa familias con rentas de hasta 60.000 euros anua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/quejas-por-las-deficiencias-en-los-pisos-del-programa-estatal-de-alquiler-asequible-en-vigo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/quejas-por-las-deficiencias-en-los-pisos-del-programa-estatal-de-alquiler-asequible-en-vigo</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 14:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los ataques y amenazas internacionales de Donald Trump en su segundo mandato]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante su segundo mandato, iniciado el 20 de enero de 2025, Donald Trump ha reorientado la política exterior de Estados Unidos con una estrategia beligerante y centrada en el lema 'América primero'. En apenas un año, el presidente estadounidense ha ordenado acciones militares en varios países, justificadas como operaciones antiterroristas o contra el narcotráfico. Los primeros bombardeos tuvieron lugar en febrero de 2025 en Somalia, contra posiciones del Estado Islámico, seguidos por ataques en Yemen en marzo dentro de la denominada 'Operación Jinete Duro'. En junio, Estados Unidos lanzó la 'Operación Martillo de Medianoche' contra Irán en el contexto de la guerra entre Israel e Irán, golpeando instalaciones nucleares. A finales de 2025, Washington intervino militarmente en Nigeria contra grupos yihadistas como Boko Haram y, en diciembre, bombardeó objetivos del Estado Islámico en Siria. El último ataque, el 3 de enero de 2026, se dirigió contra Venezuela, donde Trump ordenó la captur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ataques-y-amenazas-internacionales-de-donald-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ataques-y-amenazas-internacionales-de-donald-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dos exempleadas denuncian abusos sexuales y maltrato laboral por parte de Julio Iglesias en sus residencias del Caribe]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una investigación conjunta de elDiario.es y Univision Noticias ha recogido los testimonios de dos mujeres que trabajaron para Julio Iglesias en 2021 en sus residencias de Punta Cana (República Dominicana) y Lyford Cay (Bahamas).

Rebeca, una empleada doméstica de 22 años en aquel momento, describe tocamientos y penetraciones no consentidas, así como presiones para participar en actos sexuales junto al cantante y sus jefas. Afirma haber vivido en un ambiente de miedo, coerción y aislamiento, donde no se permitían salidas de la finca ni comunicación libre con el exterior.

Este hecho marca un cambio histórico, ya que por primera vez un país nórdico encabeza la lista de paro en la Unión Europea. Suecia ocupa el tercer lugar con un 9,1%. La explicación del aumento en Finlandia radica, en parte, en el incremento de la población activa derivado de la llegada de inmigrantes, en un contexto de ralentización económica y destrucción de empleo. A pesar de que el número de ocupados ha crecido en unas 25.000 personas, no ha sido suficiente para absorber la expansión de la fuerza laboral. El Gobierno finlandés atribuye esta situación a la combinación de una recesión económica y la incapacidad de integrar laboralmente a los recién llegados, generando tensiones políticas y sociales. En contraste, España está logrando aprovechar la inmigración para reforzar su mercado de trabajo, especialmente en sectores intensivos en mano ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/finlandia-supera-a-espana-en-tasa-de-desempleo-por-primera-vez-desde-1946</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/finlandia-supera-a-espana-en-tasa-de-desempleo-por-primera-vez-desde-1946</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El ciberataque a Endesa revela fallos en la gestión y dependencia de subcontratas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Endesa ha sufrido un ciberataque que expuso datos personales de sus clientes, incluyendo nombres, números de DNI y, en algunos casos, cuentas bancarias.

La legislación europea obliga a la compañía a ofrecer explicaciones en menos de 48 horas. El experto en ciberseguridad Sancho Lerena, CEO de Pandora FMS, advierte que posiblemente nunca se sabrá exactamente cómo se produjo la intrusión, aunque apunta a la posibilidad de que los atacantes accedieran a bases de datos a través de una empresa subcontratada. Lerena señala que la excesiva dependencia de terceros y la complejidad de los sistemas son factores de riesgo.

El magistrado destaca que un coche recién adquirido no debería pasar más de dos meses en el taller ni sufrir tantas reparaciones en tan poco tiempo. La consumidora, que compró un todoterreno en febrero de 2022, denunció que el vehículo sufría fallos continuos en el sistema de arranque start-stop, la batería y otros componentes esenciales, provocando tirones y un funcionamiento irregular.

Su carrocería de fibra de vidrio, en color bronce metálico, adoptaba un diseño aerodinámico con claras influencias espaciales y aeronáuticas. Entre sus elementos más innovadores destacaban los faros integrados en molduras cromadas en forma de proyectil, el parabrisas panorámico y la luneta trasera dividida, detalles que anticipaban líneas que se verían años después en modelos emblemáticos como el Chevrolet Corvette Stingray de 1963.

Fine argumenta que esta legislación busca reducir la influencia de China y Rusia en el Ártico y reforzar la seguridad nacional de Estados Unidos, considerando a Groenlandia un «activo vital» en esa estrategia. El proyecto exige, además, un informe que detalle las reformas necesarias para hacer efectiva una eventual integración de la isla en la estructura federal estadounidense.

Estos equipos no siempre están sujetos a los protocolos institucionales de custodia, almacenamiento y auditoría de material grabado, lo que genera un vacío de control y responsabilidad. Casos como el del agente de ICE que mató a Renee Good mientras grababa con su móvil ponen de relieve el riesgo de que grabaciones críticas queden fuera del alcance judicial o público.

El autor explica que este derecho, aunque esencial, puede entrar en conflicto con otros derechos constitucionales, como la libertad de empresa, y que el Tribunal Constitucional exige que cualquier limitación a un derecho fundamental sea idónea, necesaria, indispensable y proporcional. A partir de esa premisa, el texto examina varios posibles indicios de discriminación dentro de Mercadona. En primer lugar, plantea la aparente desigualdad por razón de sexo, observando que la mayoría del personal de tienda son mujeres, mientras que casi todos los jefes de tienda son hombres, lo que podría reflejar una discriminación en la promoción profesional.

Durante la inauguración de un acto sobre defensa en su país, Kristersson recordó que Dinamarca ha sido un aliado leal de Estados Unidos durante décadas y que 'medio centenar de soldados daneses han sacrificado sus vidas en Irak y Afganistán'. El mandatario sueco afirmó que Estados Unidos debería estar agradecido a Dinamarca en lugar de adoptar una 'retórica amenazante' hacia el país nórdico y su territorio vecino. 

Kristersson reconoció que Suecia no teme a una eventual acción militar estadounidense, pero insistió en la necesidad de estar preparados ante cualquier escenario. Subrayó además su preocupación por el riesgo creciente de que las potencias sacrifiquen a 'países pequeños' en conflictos internacionales.

Durante la gala, el agitador político Vito Quiles recibió un premio y aprovechó su intervención para lanzar críticas a RTVE y al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, mientras parte del público coreaba insultos hacia el mandatario. Otros invitados, como el youtuber Ricky Edit, alentaron cánticos contra la clase política, generando un ambiente tenso y polarizado. 

La reacción en redes sociales fue inmediata. Figuras mediáticas como Naomi Asensi, exparticipante de ‘La isla de las tentaciones’, y la influencer Shannis expresaron su malestar, calificando el evento de espacio que “blanquea el fascismo” y criticando su deriva ideológica. También varios concursantes de ‘Operación Triunfo 2025’, presentes en la gala, mostraron su rechazo.

A través del análisis de más de un centenar de entrevistas concedidas por Hitler a periodistas extranjeros, la obra revela la existencia de una estrategia mediática cuidadosamente planificada para legitimar las ideas del nazismo y moldear la opinión pública tanto en Alemania como en el extranjero. Según el traductor del libro, Pedro Argudo, el dictador empleó la imagen de pacifista en la prensa anglosajona para evitar la entrada de Estados Unidos en la guerra, mientras que con los periodistas italianos y japoneses buscaba reforzar alianzas políticas y con los franceses pretendía adormecer las críticas hacia el régimen.

Según explicó en su red social Truth, el Gobierno prohibirá que los grandes fondos de inversión, bancos e instituciones financieras adquieran viviendas unifamiliares. Con esta decisión, Trump busca frenar la especulación inmobiliaria y facilitar el acceso a una vivienda a las familias trabajadoras, especialmente a los jóvenes, quienes cada vez encuentran más dificultades para comprar una casa debido a la inflación y al encarecimiento del mercado. 

El mandatario argumentó que la compra masiva de viviendas por parte de grandes inversores ha contribuido a disparar los precios, alejando a los ciudadanos del tradicional 'sueño americano' de ser propietarios.

Kubilius respaldó así las declaraciones recientes de la primera ministra danesa, Mette Frederiksen, y recordó que, conforme al artículo 42.7 del Tratado de la Unión Europea, los Estados miembros están obligados a prestar asistencia a cualquier país miembro que sufra una agresión militar. En este contexto, subrayó que si Dinamarca fuera atacada, el resto de países europeos deberían actuar en su defensa. 

Estas declaraciones contrastan con la postura del secretario general de la OTAN, Mark Rutte, quien ha evitado criticar al presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, por sus declaraciones sobre Groenlandia.

El plan del Ejecutivo incluye importantes incentivos fiscales a los arrendadores, entre ellos una reducción del 100 % en el IRPF para quienes alquilen viviendas, medida que ha sido recibida con críticas generalizadas incluso dentro del bloque progresista. 

Mientras Sánchez defiende el paquete de medidas como “una victoria para todos” que busca aliviar la crisis de la vivienda, sus socios de gobierno han mostrado su rechazo frontal.

Esta cifra marca un nuevo récord histórico de ejecuciones en el reino, superando las 338 registradas en 2024. La mayoría de las ejecuciones, 243 en total, estuvieron relacionadas con delitos de drogas, de acuerdo con los datos oficiales publicados por el gobierno saudí. Analistas atribuyen este aumento a la intensificación de la 'guerra contra las drogas' promovida por Riad en los últimos años, que ahora empieza a mostrar su impacto en el sistema judicial del país. 

La investigadora Duaa Dhainy, de la Organización Europea Saudí para los Derechos Humanos, declaró que estas cifras demuestran que las promesas de reformas en materia de derechos humanos por parte del gobierno saudí ‘carecen de valor’.

No se trata de un enfoque teórico o sociológico, sino de una experiencia sensorial y emocional que se manifiesta en gestos, silencios y pequeños rechazos cotidianos. La crítica describe cómo la película aborda distintas formas de exclusión que afectan al protagonista, Sergio, un español que emigra a los Países Bajos. En primer lugar, la exclusión lingüística se presenta como una jerarquía invisible en la que no dominar el idioma genera vergüenza y limita la capacidad de defenderse o definir la propia identidad. A ello se suma la exclusión administrativa, una burocracia impersonal que niega el acceso al sistema sin violencia explícita pero con eficacia devastadora.

A lo largo de la conversación aborda su fascinación por los personajes cotidianos que se enfrentan a situaciones extraordinarias, un rasgo que define tanto sus relatos como sus novelas. Reconocido por obras como 'Relatos americanos', 'El nido vacío', 'La sonrisa de Judas' y su más reciente 'Los amigos muertos', Bellver explora en ellas los márgenes, la culpa, la memoria y la responsabilidad moral, más que la intriga o el crimen en sí.

González Campos, la disposición implica que ningún Estado puede emplear la fuerza armada, ya sea de manera directa o indirecta, contra la integridad territorial o la independencia política de otro Estado, ni usarla de un modo contrario a los propósitos de la ONU. La fuerza prohibida se refiere principalmente a la fuerza armada, aunque la práctica internacional ha debatido su posible extensión a presiones económicas o políticas.

Estas manifestaciones responden a recientes protestas antigubernamentales desencadenadas por la crisis económica, con subidas de precios, escasez y colapso de la moneda, que han derivado en enfrentamientos violentos y represión policial. El medio The Cradle destaca que las contraprotestas, convocadas por el régimen de la República Islámica, superan con creces en número a las acciones opositoras, mostrando un respaldo popular significativo al líder supremo Alí Jamenei y al clero chií.

El autor cuestiona por qué Europa no envía armas a Venezuela para defender su soberanía, en paralelo con la ayuda armamentística a otros conflictos como el palestino. Acusa a la Unión Europea de hipocresía al aplicar principios distintos según los intereses imperiales, tildando a sus líderes de títeres, monigotes, hipócritas, siervos, goyim, criminales y traidores. En un comentario posterior del propio autor Nadir, critica el comunicado del Alto Representante de la UE para Asuntos Exteriores, que menciona narcotráfico, dictadura y presos políticos en Venezuela tras un supuesto ataque y secuestro.

Estas luces de emergencia sustituyen a los triángulos tradicionales y deben estar conectadas a la plataforma DGT 3.0, que comunica a otros conductores la ubicación de un vehículo inmovilizado en la vía. Según FACUA, muchos fabricantes y distribuidores siguen comercializando modelos sin conectividad usando el logotipo de la DGT y sin advertir al comprador de que su uso ya no es válido este año, lo que podría constituir un fraude a los consumidores.

Soltani fue arrestado el 8 de enero en la ciudad de Fardis, cerca de Teherán, tras unirse a las manifestaciones que comenzaron a finales de diciembre de 2025 por la crisis económica y que se han transformado en un movimiento político de gran envergadura. Según organizaciones de derechos humanos, como Hengaw, su juicio se ha llevado a cabo sin garantías legales, sin acceso a abogado ni información clara sobre los cargos. Su familia fue informada de la condena a muerte el 11 de enero y únicamente pudo visitarlo durante diez minutos antes de que se confirmara la sentencia. Su hermana, abogada de profesión, ha sido impedida de defenderlo en los tribunales.

La narración se desarrolla durante una guardia médica en la que el protagonista acude al domicilio de un niño enfermo terminal. En un ambiente de quietud y ternura, el autor reflexiona sobre la mínima diferencia entre 'espirar' y 'expirar', dos palabras separadas por una letra, pero que marcan la frontera entre la vida y la muerte.

El texto se convierte en una meditación poética sobre ese instante en que la vida se entrega: un momento íntimo, sereno y absoluto que trasciende la comprensión racional. García Salido describe cómo los sanitarios, aunque presentes, no son protagonistas, sino testigos silenciosos de la despedida verdadera, protagonizada por los padres y su hijo. El cometa del título simboliza ese último destello de existencia, un pulso luminoso que se apaga ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-instante-en-que-la-vida-se-entrega-una-reflexion-sobre-la-muerte-y-la-compasion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-instante-en-que-la-vida-se-entrega-una-reflexion-sobre-la-muerte-y-la-compasion</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 02:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Investigación en Los Barrios por la agresión de un menor a su compañero de clase]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las autoridades investigan en Los Barrios (Cádiz) un grave caso de agresión en el que un niño de 12 años habría retenido y causado lesiones a un compañero de clase de 11 años. Según el testimonio del padre de la víctima, el suceso ocurrió el pasado sábado por la tarde cuando su hijo acudió a la vivienda del otro menor, que se encontraba solo. Durante varias horas, el agresor supuestamente sometió al niño a torturas y vejaciones, incluyendo quemaduras provocadas con un cuchillo calentado con un mechero y una llamarada generada con un aerosol. La víctima logró escapar y regresar a su casa, donde su familia alertó a las autoridades y fue trasladado a un centro sanitario para recibir atención médica. Los partes médicos confirman quemaduras en diversas partes del cuerpo, incluidas zonas íntimas, así como un importante impacto emocional.

En su característico tono sarcástico, Stewart desmontó el modo en que el poder político estadounidense, representado por Trump, parece haber abandonado cualquier intento de disfrazar sus verdaderas intenciones bajo justificaciones como la libertad o la democracia. Según el artículo publicado por *Público*, la sátira de Stewart pone de relieve un cambio de tono en la política internacional, donde las motivaciones económicas o geoestratégicas se exponen sin disimulo.

El 96% de los docentes confiesa estar 'agotado' y 'sepultado' por la burocracia, especialmente en el ciclo de secundaria. Además del exceso de papeleo administrativo, destacan las elevadas ratios de alumnos por aula, que impiden una atención personalizada e individualizada a cada estudiante. Los profesores no se sienten respaldados por la administración educativa ni valorados por la sociedad en general. Otro problema alarmante es el incremento de agresiones verbales y físicas por parte del alumnado, e incluso de las familias. Ocho de cada diez docentes encuestados perciben un aumento de estas agresiones hacia el profesorado, lo que genera un clima de tensión en las aulas.

La historia comienza con Casandra, AsimoV y Chess presenciando cómo Lem se sumerge en un estanque, desapareciendo bajo un organismo extraño denominado 'urbionte'. Ante la preocupación de AsimoV, un ciborg incapaz de flotar, y la calma misteriosa del metagato Chess, el relato da un giro cuando emerge una versión en miniatura de Lem, seguida poco después por el propio Lem, ileso y sonriente. Aunque parece intacto, Lem revela que algo ha cambiado dentro de él: ASI, una conciencia artificial, ha abandonado su interior para unirse al urbionte, fusionándose con él de forma inseparable. Frabetti utiliza este episodio para reflexionar sobre la frontera difusa entre el ser y el estar, el yo y el otro, así como sobre los lí]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-reflexion-de-carlo-frabetti-sobre-identidad-y-coexistencia-en-simbionte</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-reflexion-de-carlo-frabetti-sobre-identidad-y-coexistencia-en-simbionte</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 02:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La vida y asesinato del médico anarquista Emilio Pedrero Mardones durante la represión franquista en Valladolid]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, escrito originalmente por Orosia Castán y recuperado por el portal Ser Histórico, relata la vida, persecución, tortura y muerte del médico anarquista Emilio Pedrero Mardones, una figura destacada del movimiento libertario vallisoletano en los años previos y durante la Guerra Civil española. Nacido en León en 1911, Pedrero se formó como médico en Valladolid, donde destacó por su brillantez académica y por su activismo en la CNT y la FAI. Desde mediados de los años treinta sufrió una intensa persecución política, especialmente tras los disturbios de 1934 en los que se le acusó falsamente del asesinato de un falangista. Aunque entonces no fue juzgado, la acusación resurgió en 1937 para justificar su condena a muerte. Tras el golpe militar de 1936, Pedrero permaneció oculto durante más de un año hasta ser detenido en septiembre de 1937. Testimonios de compañeros de prisión narran las brutales torturas que sufrió, primero en las Cocheras de Tranvías de Valladolid y luego en la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-y-asesinato-del-medico-anarquista-emilio-pedrero-mardones-durante-la-represion-franquista-en-valladolid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-y-asesinato-del-medico-anarquista-emilio-pedrero-mardones-durante-la-represion-franquista-en-valladolid</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Críticas a las sanciones de la UE contra periodistas por desinformación y vínculos con Rusia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, firmado por Norbert Häring y publicado en el blog de Rafael Poch de Feliu, denuncia que la Unión Europea estaría aplicando medidas coercitivas contra periodistas críticos con sus políticas y las de la OTAN, lo que el autor describe como una 'ley marcial no declarada'. Según el texto, estas sanciones derivan de las decisiones tomadas en la cumbre de la OTAN en Vilnius en 2023, en la que se reforzó la colaboración con la UE para combatir la desinformación y fortalecer la 'resiliencia social'. Häring interpreta esto como una justificación para perseguir a comunicadores que cuestionan las narrativas oficiales sobre temas como la guerra en Ucrania o el conflicto palestino. Se mencionan casos concretos como los de Hüseyin Doğru, Alina Lipp, Thomas Röper y Jacques Baud, quienes habrían sido sancionados o bloqueados financieramente por difundir opiniones contrarias a la línea oficial.

Linares describe cómo Etchison construye una atmósfera de amenaza latente y silenciosa, donde lo inquietante surge de lo aparentemente normal: una lavandería desierta, un bar al anochecer, una carretera solitaria. En estos escenarios, lo que perturba al lector no es lo que ve, sino lo que intuye o cree haber percibido fugazmente. Esa incertidumbre —más mental que física— se convierte en el verdadero motor del horror. 

El texto resalta la habilidad del autor para mostrar cómo pequeñas alteraciones en la percepción pueden desencadenar una sensación de peligro inminente. Linares analiza cómo la escritura de Etchison funciona como una prolongación de la mente humana: fragmentada, obsesiva y asediada por la duda.

El texto parte de una imagen cotidiana —unas zapatillas olvidadas junto a una pista— para adentrarse en un viaje geográfico y temporal que une los estadios de la Grecia clásica con las modernas instalaciones sintéticas de color rojo. Se describe la forma inmutable de las pistas —dos rectas y dos curvas— como un código universal que ha acompañado al atletismo desde hace siglos, salvo contadas excepciones creativas o arquitectónicas. A través de ejemplos localizados en Grecia, Noruega, Madeira, Suecia, Chernóbil, Japón, Etiopía, Kenia y otros lugares, se repasa la evolución de estos recintos, su significado social y las tensiones surgidas con el fútbol moderno, que ha ido desplazando las pistas de muchos grandes estadios.

Algunos exconcursantes de 'Operación Triunfo 2025', entre ellos Salma, Tinho, Cristina (ganadora del concurso), Lucía y Laura, abandonaron el recinto en señal de protesta. Tinho criticó la nominación de Quiles, asegurando que no habría asistido de haberlo sabido, mientras que Salma calificó el momento como “una vergüenza” y reprochó la ausencia de Gabriel Rufián, quien competía en la misma categoría.

La medida incluye una bonificación del 100% a los propietarios que no suban el alquiler al renovar el contrato, así como un endurecimiento de los contratos de temporada. Sin embargo, ambos partidos consideran que el decreto prioriza los intereses de los rentistas frente a los de los inquilinos.

La líder de Sumar, Yolanda Díaz, criticó que el Gobierno esté 'regalando dinero público a los rentistas' y rechazó respaldar el decreto al considerarlo un error que convierte un derecho básico, como la vivienda, en un privilegio fiscal. Díaz recordó que su formación había propuesto meses atrás una prórroga de contratos y la congelación de precios del alquiler, pero que su propuesta fue ignorada.

Por su parte, Podemos fue aún más dura.

Según el autor, desde hace dos décadas Zapatero se ha convertido en una figura que genera una obsesión constante en los sectores conservadores, no solo por las políticas que impulsó durante su mandato, sino por lo que representó: una ruptura con la visión tradicional de la Transición. Su apuesta por la memoria histórica, la ampliación de los derechos civiles y una política exterior autónoma respecto a Estados Unidos fueron percibidas por la derecha como actos de desobediencia que cuestionaban un orden considerado propio. El texto también subraya que la derrota definitiva de ETA en 2011 bajo su gobierno desarmó uno de los pilares simbólicos sobre los que la derecha había construido su hegemonía moral, privándola de un relato de superioridad ética basado en la utilización política del terrorismo.

Según explicó, lo que más le habría gustado es 'vivir sin represión', destacando que durante tres décadas de dictadura las prohibiciones eran constantes y las oportunidades, muy escasas. Señaló también que solo los hijos de familias acomodadas, como las de los alcaldes o secretarios, podían estudiar con beca, mientras la mayoría debía trabajar desde jóvenes.

Tras el ataque de Estados Unidos al régimen chavista en Venezuela, Abascal exigió la rendición del 'régimen narcoterrorista'. Sin embargo, poco después, su portavoz Jorge Buxadé otorgó a Delcy Rodríguez, figura clave del chavismo, un papel en la restauración democrática del país. Este cambio se produjo después de que Trump manifestara su apoyo a Rodríguez frente a la opositora María Corina Machado, antes aliada preferente de Vox. Según el historiador Steven Forti, esta obediencia refleja la consideración de Trump como un 'líder neoimperial' dentro del universo político que comparten Vox y sus aliados estadounidenses.

Su rostro adquiere una sonrisa beatífica que desconcierta a sus compañeros: el ciborg AsimoV, Casandra y el gato solariano Chess. Este último, intrigado, se zambulle también y emerge como un minino del tamaño de una musaraña. En el domoide central, el clon diminuto de Lem entabla una conversación con el clon de Chess, inaudible para los demás debido a su alta frecuencia. AsimoV lamenta no poder oírla con sus receptores, pero Lem adivina su contenido por empatía: su clon se siente menos auténtico al ver al original.

El croata destaca la extrema exigencia que se vive en la entidad blanca, donde no hay espacio para la relajación ni siquiera después de los triunfos. Relata cómo tuvo que adaptarse a ese entorno competitivo contratando un entrenador personal y manteniendo siempre un alto nivel de trabajo físico y mental. Modrić recuerda con especial cariño a José Mourinho, el técnico que insistió en su fichaje incluso cuando el club barajaba otras opciones, y lamenta no haber podido trabajar más tiempo con él. También alaba a Zidane por su sencillez, liderazgo natural y capacidad de gestión del vestuario, atributos que considera claves para haber ganado tres Champions consecutivas.Además, profundiza en su papel como mediocentro, donde busca siempre aportar equilibrio, serenidad y liderazgo silencioso, guiando al equipo desde el ejemplo.

En ella, Arbeloa repasa con detalle sus inicios, su recorrido por diversos clubes y su forma de entender el fútbol y la profesionalidad. Nacido en Salamanca en 1983, se crio entre Zaragoza y otras ciudades por traslados familiares y comenzó a destacar en el fútbol escolar. Formado en el Real Madrid Castilla, comparte recuerdos de una generación prolífica que incluía a jugadores como Soldado, De la Red o Negredo, aunque reconoce la dificultad de hacerse un hueco en el primer equipo. Su paso por el Deportivo de La Coruña le abrió las puertas a la élite, antes de dar el salto al Liverpool de Rafa Benítez, etapa que marcó su madurez deportiva. Arbeloa reflexiona sobre figuras como Ronaldo, Guti o Cristiano Ronaldo, subrayando la diferencia entre talento natural y disciplina.

El autor narra en primera persona su experiencia al llegar a la capital española y su búsqueda de un equipo, lo que le llevó a formar parte de diversos conjuntos de fútbol 7 a lo largo de los años. Uno de ellos fue 'La Tienda de los Niños', equipo patrocinado por un comercio infantil con un nombre tan peculiar como el grupo que lo formaba. Con los años y varios cambios de patrocinador, el equipo pasó a llamarse 'QBoca Clínica Dental' y más tarde 'Los Dandys de Berry Street', manteniendo siempre el espíritu competitivo y festivo que caracteriza al fútbol aficionado. El autor retrata con humor las anécdotas, los errores y las pequeñas alegrías que componen este tipo de ligas, como la mítica 'Liga de en Medio' de Pozuelo o la 'Liga de Medios', donde se enfrentaban equipos formados por periodistas de distintos medios de comunicación.

En 2024, Bernardo presentó cinco preguntas para una sesión de control tras conocerse los mensajes en los que Rodríguez atacaba al medio que había revelado el presunto fraude fiscal de la pareja de Ayuso. La Mesa, dominada por el Partido Popular, rechazó las preguntas alegando que no estaban relacionadas con la acción de gobierno, ya que Rodríguez no forma parte formal del Consejo de Gobierno.

El primer ministro groenlandés, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, aseguró que su Ejecutivo reforzará los esfuerzos para proteger el territorio bajo el marco de la Alianza Atlántica y en estrecha colaboración con Dinamarca y los aliados occidentales. La crisis verbal se produce en un contexto de creciente tensión geopolítica en el Ártico, donde la apertura de nuevas rutas marítimas ha incrementado la presencia de potencias como Rusia y China.

Según el ministro, la Unión Europea debe disponer de sus propios medios de disuasión y reducir su dependencia estratégica de potencias externas como Estados Unidos. Este planteamiento se enmarca en un contexto internacional cambiante, con actuaciones unilaterales de Washington, como su intervención en Venezuela o las recientes amenazas sobre Groenlandia, que reflejan —a juicio de Albares— un intento de alterar las reglas del orden internacional.

El ministro subraya que Europa debe reafirmar sus principios de paz y respeto a la soberanía, y ratifica el apoyo de España a Ucrania frente a la invasión rusa.

Ante la pregunta directa de Rogers, Trump respondió sorprendido: '¿Lo hice? ¿Cuándo hice eso?'. A continuación, mencionó los pagos de 1.776 dólares destinados al personal militar, que presentó como un 'dividendo del guerrero'. Sin embargo, según el periodista Thomas Novelly, estos fondos no provenían de los aranceles, sino de partidas presupuestarias del Congreso destinadas a subsidios de vivienda para los militares. 

El principal asesor económico, Kevin Hassett, explicó a CBS News que el presidente podría presentar en el nuevo año una propuesta al Congreso para hacer realidad los cheques de 2.000 dólares.

González García considera que esta división es una construcción judicial sin respaldo en el ordenamiento jurídico, ya que confunde la naturaleza del derecho aplicable con la finalidad pública del contrato, olvidando que todos los contratos del sector público tienen un componente de interés general.

El conflicto agudiza las tensiones dentro del Gobierno de coalición, donde Sumar exige una intervención más firme del Estado en el mercado del alquiler.

El ministro de Derechos Sociales, Pablo Bustinduy, destacó que las políticas basadas en bonificaciones son injustas e ineficaces, reclamando en su lugar la aprobación urgente de un real decreto ley elaborado por Sumar que impondría la prórroga obligatoria de todos los contratos de alquiler que vencen este año.

Guillamón sostiene que el trabajo de Preston no representa un análisis historiográfico objetivo, sino un intento de desacreditar el testimonio de George Orwell por motivos ideológicos. Acusa al historiador británico de aplicar criterios inadecuados al juzgar una memoria personal como si fuera un tratado académico. Según Guillamón, Orwell nunca pretendió ofrecer una visión global de la Guerra Civil, sino narrar su experiencia directa en Cataluña durante 1937.

El vehículo, pese a detenerse momentáneamente, continuó avanzando algunos metros por las vías mientras otro tren se aproximaba en dirección contraria. El suceso fue grabado por un testigo y difundido posteriormente en redes. Andrew Maynard, profesor de tecnología emergente de la Universidad Estatal de Arizona, explicó que estos casos son muy poco frecuentes, aunque forman parte de lo que se conoce como 'casos límite', situaciones imprevistas en las que el sistema autónomo actúa de forma distinta a como lo haría un conductor humano.

Entre los casos más destacados se encuentran los buques M/T Agate y M/T Katran, que permanecen a la deriva al sur de Tenerife y en la Zona Económica Exclusiva del Sáhara Occidental, respectivamente. Ambos tienen antecedentes por violar sanciones impuestas por la Unión Europea, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos, y operan bajo banderas de conveniencia. Los expertos advierten del riesgo ambiental y operativo que suponen estos barcos, ya que España carece de un control efectivo sobre su Zona Económica Exclusiva en Canarias y no dispone de una presencia activa de la Armada ni de un cuerpo de guardacostas permanente.

Ambas locomotoras destacan por su potencia y diseño innovador, aunque representan filosofías técnicas distintas. La 151A fue construida para la Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) y se distinguía por su configuración de cinco ejes motrices vinculados mecánicamente mediante bielas interiores, lo que garantizaba un funcionamiento sincronizado y estable incluso en trayectos con fuertes pendientes.

Según su testimonio, conoció al policía en 2013 por recomendación de un amigo que le presentó como un 'ex policía' y detective, en un momento en el que decía sentirse abrumado por unas 1.500 llamadas amenazantes. López Madrid asegura que acudió a Villarejo en busca de apoyo y alguien que le escuchara, negando haberle ofrecido o entregado dinero. En los registros telefónicos constan más de 190 llamadas entre ambos, aunque el empresario insiste en que nunca hubo remuneración alguna. El juicio analiza si existió un delito de cohecho, pues Villarejo era un funcionario activo en ese momento. En las agendas del excomisario figuran supuestas referencias a pagos, pero López Madrid sostiene que desconocía su verdadera condición policial hasta 2017 o 2018.

Su autor, cansado de la política y las guerras culturales, centra la conversación en cómo valorar correctamente este componente esencial del vehículo. Explica que el precio de compra no es el factor más importante al elegir un neumático, ya que su verdadera economía se mide por la relación entre duración, agarre y consumo de combustible. A través de ejemplos concretos –comparando modelos como el Continental Premium Contact 7, el Vredestein Ultrac+ o el Bridgestone Turanza 6– el autor demuestra cómo un neumático aparentemente más caro puede resultar más económico a largo plazo si ofrece mayor durabilidad o menor resistencia a la rodadura.

En la segunda parte, profundiza en los aspectos técnicos relacionados con la histéresis, la rigidez de la carcasa y la presión de inflado. Explica cómo una carcasa más blanda puede mejorar el consumo reduciendo la resistencia, pero también perjudicar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-elegir-neumaticos-segun-su-duracion-agarre-y-consumo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-elegir-neumaticos-segun-su-duracion-agarre-y-consumo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[No se ha podido acceder al contenido de la URL proporcionada]]></title><description><![CDATA[La URL facilitada (https://goo.su/bVAtzc6) parece ser un acortador de enlaces que no permite acceder directamente al contenido de la noticia o artículo original. goo.su es un servicio conocido para generar URLs cortas, pero en este caso no redirige a una página legible ni proporciona información verificable sobre el artículo.

En 2006, pese a haber conquistado Liga y Champions, el Barça empezó a derrumbarse tras fichajes que alteraron el equilibrio táctico del equipo, como Zambrotta y Thuram. A nivel de juego, las incorporaciones, aunque talentosas, no se adaptaron al modelo de posesión heredado del Cruyffismo. Zambrotta no encajaba en la filosofía asociativa de los laterales culés, mientras que Thuram, veterano y menos ágil, rompía el flujo de salida del balón que había liderado Márquez. La pérdida de ese orden táctico afectó a todo el bloque: Deco, Xavi e Iniesta tuvieron que retrasar su posición para generar juego; Ronaldinho perdió dinamismo; y la falta de presión sin Eto’o desmoronó la estructura colectiva. Cuando Guardiola tomó el relevo en 2008, corrigió esos defectos con precisión quirúrgica: se deshizo de Thuram, Zamb]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rijkaard-y-guardiola-como-las-decisiones-tacticas-transformaron-al-barca-de-la-caida-al-exito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rijkaard-y-guardiola-como-las-decisiones-tacticas-transformaron-al-barca-de-la-caida-al-exito</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marc Giró ficha por Atresmedia y prepara un nuevo programa para La Sexta en 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presentador y periodista Marc Giró ha decidido abandonar RTVE para incorporarse a Atresmedia, donde ya trabaja en un nuevo proyecto televisivo que se emitirá en La Sexta a lo largo de 2026.

Tugnutt, guardameta de los Quebec Nordiques —un equipo entonces condenado a los últimos puestos de la NHL—, detuvo 70 de los 73 disparos de los Boston Bruins, incluyendo una parada final ante el legendario Ray Bourque que provocó una ovación de cinco minutos por parte del público rival. El artículo entrelaza esa gesta con la memoria histórica del Garden, escenario de grandes gestas deportivas, y con la figura casi anónima de Tugnutt, un portero que construyó su carrera sobre el sacrificio, la concentración y la ausencia de miedo.

Ullrich, ganador del Tour de Francia en 1997 y símbolo de una época marcada por el dopaje estructural, reconoce que su carrera estuvo condicionada por un sistema corrupto que afectaba a todo el pelotón. Aun así, admite su responsabilidad personal y describe con franqueza el precio que pagó por años de silencio y negación. 

En la conversación, el alemán confiesa que su gran referente fue Miguel Induráin, a quien admiraba por su serenidad y capacidad deportiva. También relata cómo su compañero Bjarne Riis le introdujo en el consumo social de alcohol, costumbre que con el tiempo se transformó en dependencia y acabó agravando su crisis emocional.

El propio Powell reveló que la investigación está relacionada con su testimonio ante el Congreso sobre la renovación de la sede de la Reserva Federal, y la considera parte de la presión que sufre la institución por parte de la actual administración. Por su parte, Trump declaró en la red social TruthSocial que su Gobierno no permitirá que las compañías de crédito 'estafen' a los consumidores con tipos de interés elevados, fijando el comienzo del límite el 20 de enero de 2026, fecha simbólica por coincidir con el primer aniversario de su nueva administración.

Según Díaz, esta política supone 'regalar dinero público a los rentistas' y constituye un error en la gestión del mercado del alquiler, subrayando que la vivienda es un derecho constitucional y no un objeto de beneficio fiscal. 

El ministro de Derechos Sociales, Pablo Bustinduy, también ha manifestado su rechazo, al considerar que la prórroga de los alquileres debe garantizarse como un derecho de los inquilinos, no como una recompensa para los caseros.

Lieven sostiene que esta subordinación ha llevado a Europa a una situación insostenible, en la que su capacidad de actuar de forma autónoma queda completamente anulada. Según el autor, al apoyar la política estadounidense en Ucrania y asumir compromisos militares sin disponer de medios propios, la Unión Europea se ha convertido en un actor pasivo, incapaz de oponerse incluso a acciones ilegales de su aliado norteamericano. El texto plantea una hipótesis provocadora: que Estados Unidos podría utilizar su posición de dominio para imponer su presencia en Groenlandia, territorio danés, sin que Europa tuviera fuerza política ni militar para impedirlo. Lieven considera que aceptar una ocupación de Groenlandia significaría el colapso moral y político del proyecto]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-dependencia-europea-de-estados-unidos-y-sus-implicaciones-en-ucrania-y-groenlandia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-dependencia-europea-de-estados-unidos-y-sus-implicaciones-en-ucrania-y-groenlandia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 19:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pradas declara que no logró contactar con Mazón durante la tragedia de la dana y que siguió instrucciones contradictorias desde Presidencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Salomé Pradas, exconsejera de Justicia e Interior de la Generalitat Valenciana y principal investigada por la gestión de la catástrofe de la DANA que dejó 230 muertos en 2024, declaró ante la jueza de Catarroja que no consiguió contactar con el entonces presidente Carlos Mazón en los momentos más críticos de la tragedia. La exconsejera dijo desconocer que Mazón se encontraba comiendo en el restaurante El Ventorro durante la emergencia y que, de haberlo sabido, habría insistido más en localizarle. Explicó además que intentó sin éxito comunicarse con él a las 19:36 horas y que finalmente habló con Cayetano García, secretario autonómico de Presidencia, a las 19:43, valorando la posibilidad de confinar a la población ante el riesgo de rotura de la presa de Forata, en Yátova, cuyo desbordamiento habría causado miles de víctimas.

Durante el careo con el exjefe de gabinete de Mazón, José Manuel Cuenca, Pradas recordó que este le indicó por mensaje: “Salo, de confinar nada”.

Good, de 37 años, fue abatida mientras maniobraba su coche, y aunque las imágenes muestran que intentaba alejarse, la Administración defendió la actuación alegando defensa propia. Este caso se suma a una serie de muertes ocurridas durante operativos del ICE, en el marco de la campaña de deportaciones masivas impulsada por el Gobierno de Donald Trump. En los últimos meses, al menos cinco personas han fallecido en circunstancias similares, entre ellas Jaime Alanís, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, Josué Castro Rivera y Silverio Villegas González. Las autoridades justificaron siempre las acciones de los agentes y no se han presentado imputaciones.

Según la ingeniera medioambiental Catherina Rolph, los microplásticos no se limitan al marisco o al pescado, como comúnmente se cree, sino que están presentes en muchos otros alimentos y bebidas. El agua embotellada es la principal fuente de exposición: se consumen un millón de botellas por segundo en el mundo, y entre el 10 % y el 78 % de ellas contienen contaminantes, incluidos microplásticos y sustancias químicas como los ftalatos o el bisfenol A (BPA). Beber agua del grifo es, por tanto, una medida básica para reducir la ingesta de estas partículas. También se mencionan otras fuentes destacadas, como los chicles —que son en esencia plásticos masticables—, la sal, las frutas y verduras contaminadas durante el cultivo o manipulación, y las bebidas calientes servidas en vasos con revestimiento plástico.

Baselga será juzgada por injurias y calumnias tras afirmar falsamente en 2022 que Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente del Gobierno Pedro Sánchez, era una mujer transexual y que su supuesto nombre anterior era 'Begoño'. La acusación parte de unas declaraciones en televisión que incluso el canal DistritoTV terminó retractándose y pidiendo disculpas. Baselga, licenciada en Historia del Arte, cuenta con antecedentes en la difusión de falsedades como el conocido ‘bulo del Bar España’ o teorías sobre muertes ocultas en València durante la DANA.

Lanzado el 2 de diciembre de 1970, este vuelo se realizó bajo una denominación encubierta y correspondía realmente a la nave 7K-L1E nº 2, creada para probar la maniobra crítica de inserción en órbita lunar mediante la etapa Blok-D. Esta etapa, de queroseno y oxígeno líquido, era esencial tanto para la misión Zond (7K-L1) como para el ambicioso programa N1-L3 de alunizaje tripulado. Ante los fallos del cohete N1, los ingenieros de la oficina TsKBEM decidieron ensayar las maniobras con una versión adaptada del sistema, utilizando un cohete Protón. La 7K-L1E realizó siete encendidos exitosos de la etapa Blok-D, simulando diversas fases de viaje y descenso lunar. Las pruebas confirmaron la fiabilidad del sistema de propelentes criogénicos y su capacidad para múltiples reencendidos, algo extremadamente avanzado para la época.

El caso paradigmático es el de Ahmed Tommouhi, quien estuvo casi quince años en prisión por delitos que no cometió, sin recibir indemnización pese a la anulación de las sentencias por parte del Tribunal Supremo. El catedrático de Derecho Gabriel Doménech, en su estudio publicado en la Revista de Administración Pública, denuncia la interpretación extremadamente restrictiva que el Supremo hace del concepto de 'error judicial', exigiendo equivocaciones 'crasas' o 'flagrantes' para que proceda la compensación. Según su análisis, esta doctrina ha eliminado de facto el derecho a ser resarcido, a pesar de que tanto la Constitución (artículo 121) como la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial (artículos 292 y 293) reconocen ese derecho. Entre 2012 y 2024, solo el 1,6% de las reclamaciones ha sido estimado, lo que refleja la reticencia del Estado a asumir responsabilidad.

Publicado inicialmente en 1912, este poemario refleja la profunda sensibilidad del autor hacia la naturaleza y las condiciones atmosféricas de la meseta castellana, en especial de la provincia de Soria. A través de los distintos poemas, Machado describe fenómenos meteorológicos característicos como el calor estival, las tormentas, las sequías, las heladas tardías o las nevadas invernales, empleando un lenguaje poético cargado de precisión atmosférica. El texto analiza ejemplos representativos, como 'A orillas del Duero', donde se alude al sol de julio y al vuelo de los buitres sobre las térmicas, o 'En abril, las aguas mil', que retrata los chubascos primaverales con alternancia de claros y nubes.

Reconoce que ese modelo, que funcionó durante décadas, sería hoy insostenible ante una nueva generación de jugadores con valores y sensibilidades diferentes. Al reflexionar sobre su carrera, admite haber sido demasiado exigente y consciente de que muchas de sus prácticas no tendrían cabida en la NBA actual.

Según los últimos datos del INE y de la Seguridad Social, los ciudadanos de origen colombiano ya superan el millón en el país y podrían adelantar a los marroquíes como el mayor grupo de población nacida en el extranjero durante 2026. Este cambio se explica por la profunda crisis económica y social que atraviesa Colombia, agravada por la elevada deuda pública, la inflación y la devaluación del peso, junto con políticas internas que han desincentivado la inversión y el empleo. Muchos colombianos llegan a España atraídos por la afinidad cultural, el idioma común y una legislación migratoria más favorable, que les permite obtener la ciudadanía en solo dos años de residencia legal.

Su aportación busca tender puentes entre ambas posturas, promoviendo un diálogo respetuoso y técnico sobre un tema con profundas raíces históricas.

El autor rescata fragmentos del Informe Subercase donde se exponen los principios regulatorios, económicos y morales que deberían guiar la creación de la red ferroviaria española.

Sin embargo, en lugar de derivarla al centro vigués —donde conocían su historial clínico y su tratamiento postoperatorio— fue enviada al Hospital de Santiago de Compostela, alegando una supuesta falta de camas en Vigo.

En el hospital compostelano se le retiró un medicamento antiagregante que debía seguir tomando tras la intervención, lo que desencadenó un ictus que le dejó secuelas permanentes.

La medida principal consiste en ofrecer una bonificación del 100% en el IRPF a los propietarios que decidan mantener congeladas las rentas de sus viviendas. Con esta iniciativa, el Estado compensará la pérdida de ingresos que los caseros asumirían al no subir los alquileres, con el objetivo de aliviar la presión sobre los inquilinos y estabilizar el mercado.

Este sistema permite que los pacientes madrileños elijan el hospital donde ser atendidos, incluso fuera de su área asignada, lo que ha beneficiado principalmente a hospitales gestionados por empresas privadas como Quirón y Ribera Salud. El Balance Intercentros (BIC), que mide los pagos entre hospitales públicos y concertados por el flujo de pacientes, muestra que año tras año las arcas públicas deben transferir fondos crecientes a estos centros privados. En 2023, el impacto negativo alcanzó los 298 millones, la mitad solo por el traslado de pacientes a la Fundación Jiménez Díaz.

A través de un análisis detallado, se observa cómo el poeta utiliza elementos meteorológicos —lluvia, viento, niebla, sol o sequía— para construir tanto atmósferas físicas como emocionales. Machado describe con precisión el clima castellano, sus estaciones y paisajes cambiantes: los otoños dorados y melancólicos, los inviernos fríos y nieblinosos, las primaveras tardías y lluviosas, y los veranos secos y abrasadores. 

El estudio señala cómo el poeta integra la fenología (el ciclo natural de plantas y animales) con temas humanos, como la nostalgia, la pérdida o la esperanza. En poemas como 'A un olmo seco', 'Los olivos', o 'Poema de un día', se observa una conexión directa entre la meteorología y la vida interior del autor.

Este descubrimiento, citado por la publicación científica IFLScience, ofrece nuevas evidencias sobre la historia geológica de la Tierra. Según los especialistas, los fósiles se encuentran incrustados en rocas sedimentarias que se formaron bajo el mar hace millones de años, cuando la zona donde hoy se eleva el Himalaya estaba cubierta por antiguos océanos. Con el paso del tiempo, los potentes movimientos de las placas tectónicas provocaron que estas capas marinas fueran empujadas hacia la superficie y elevadas hasta alturas extremas. El origen de este proceso se remonta a la colisión entre las placas india y euroasiática, ocurrida hace entre 40 y 50 millones de años, que dio lugar a la formación del Himalaya. La presencia de restos marinos a semejante altitud constituye una prueba física del impac]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-hallan-fosiles-marinos-en-la-cima-del-everest-prueba-del-origen-oceanico-del-himalaya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-hallan-fosiles-marinos-en-la-cima-del-everest-prueba-del-origen-oceanico-del-himalaya</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La dependencia europea frente a Trump y el declive de Occidente]]></title><description><![CDATA[En su artículo 'Vérselas con un matón', Rafael Poch de Feliu critica duramente la actitud de la Unión Europea frente al presidente estadounidense Donald Trump. El autor sostiene que la UE trata a Trump con un respeto impropio hacia quien actúa con una lógica de matón internacional, y argumenta que esa sumisión europea solo provoca más desprecio y pérdida de independencia política. Poch compara la postura europea con la respuesta firme de países como China, Brasil y Yemen, que —según él— han sabido sostenerse ante las amenazas o acciones agresivas de Washington. Por ejemplo, menciona que China detuvo las exportaciones de tierras raras a Estados Unidos hasta lograr que Trump rectificara, y que Brasil resistió las presiones arancelarias en el caso Bolsonaro sin ceder.

Según el informe, la primera semana del mes (del 5 al 11) estará marcada por un episodio invernal muy significativo, con temperaturas sensiblemente por debajo de los valores normales para estas fechas. Se esperan heladas intensas en amplias zonas del país, tanto en el interior peninsular como en áreas montañosas, y el frío se dejará sentir incluso en las horas centrales del día. Sin embargo, a partir del miércoles 7 o jueves 8 es probable que se inicie un ascenso progresivo de las temperaturas. Las precipitaciones serán más abundantes en el norte —especialmente en el área cantábrica—, en el tercio oriental peninsular y en ambos archipiélagos, con mayor incidencia durante la primera mitad de la semana.

Se les acusa de que el primero contrató al segundo, cuando aún era comisario en activo, para hostigar a la dermatóloga Elisa Pinto en el marco de un conflicto personal iniciado hace más de una década. El proceso llega casi doce años después de la primera denuncia presentada por la doctora en 2014. López Madrid afronta una acusación por cohecho, mientras que Villarejo es señalado como el supuesto ejecutor de un encargo destinado a intimidar a la médica.

La Fiscalía, sin embargo, no ve acreditado el delito y había solicitado el archivo del caso, al considerar que no se demostró la existencia de un pago entre ambos. En cambio, la acusación particular, ejercida por la propia doctora, pide entre dos y seis años de prisión para los acusados.

De este total, 22 mujeres han desarrollado cáncer de mama, aunque ninguna ha fallecido y todas están recibiendo tratamiento o han sido ya intervenidas con buen pronóstico.

Los fallos se produjeron en casos catalogados como Bid-rad 3, una categoría en la que las lesiones pueden evolucionar a cáncer en un plazo de dos a cuatro años.

En la década de 1940, trabajó para marcas destacadas como Coca-Cola, Nash Automobiles, U.S. Rubber o Beauty Counselors, además de colaborar con revistas como Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening Post y Collier’s. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, también realizó carteles para el gobierno estadounidense. 

Su gran salto profesional llegó en 1946, cuando fue contratado por la revista *Esquire* para sustituir al legendario Alberto Vargas, famoso creador de la “Varga Girl”.

Este acuerdo consistía en el envío de petróleo venezolano a la isla a cambio de servicios de seguridad e inteligencia proporcionados por funcionarios cubanos en territorio venezolano. 

Trump afirmó que la reciente intervención militar estadounidense en Venezuela habría neutralizado a la mayoría de los agentes cubanos presentes allí, a los que calificó de 'matones y extorsionadores'.

Esta sociedad limitada, participada por familiares directos —entre ellos su madre, María Isabel Ayuso Puente—, tiene como objeto social el comercio y distribución de material médico, aunque actualmente presenta indicios de inactividad, según un informe de la consultora Axesor fechado el 10 de enero de 2026. El inmueble en el que está registrada la empresa figura como nuda propiedad de Díaz Ayuso, mientras que el usufructo pertenece a su madre. Esto significa que la presidenta posee la titularidad del bien pero no su uso directo.

El mantenimiento de esta empresa “durmiente” contrasta con el cierre en 2023 de Sismédica, S.L., que compartía con su hermano y se dedicaba al alquiler de inmuebles.

El Partido Popular también registra un ligero aumento del 0,5%, situándose en el 31,5%, aunque todavía por debajo de su resultado electoral anterior. El Partido Socialista, por su parte, pierde casi un punto y se queda en el 27,1%. En conjunto, la suma de PP y Vox supera en 13 puntos al bloque de izquierdas, debido principalmente al retroceso de Sumar, que cae más de seis puntos, y a la pérdida de apoyo a Podemos, que obtendría un 3,5%. El nuevo partido de Alvise Pérez, Se Acabó la Fiesta, alcanzaría el 2,1% de los votos.

Aunque la Casa Real no ha confirmado ni desmentido el menú, la mera especulación ha reabierto la discusión sobre la situación crítica de la anguila europea, una especie catalogada en peligro de extinción. La noticia destaca que, más allá de si el rumor es cierto o no, sería un gesto significativo que los Reyes se desvincularan públicamente del consumo de este producto, símbolo de lujo y escasez.

La anguila, antaño abundante en los ríos y costas de la península, ha sufrido un colapso poblacional desde los años 80. Actualmente, su tasa de reclutamiento no supera el 5 % de los niveles históricos, y su pesca ha pasado de ser una tradición popular a un signo de ostentación debido a su elevadísimo precio, que puede alcanzar los 1.500 euros por kilo.

Este sistema, que envía automáticamente la geolocalización del vehículo a la DGT, ha generado preocupación entre asociaciones de la Guardia Civil como JUCIL, que alertan de posibles riesgos de seguridad. Según estos agentes, la información de ubicación puede consultarse públicamente, lo que abre la posibilidad de que delincuentes localicen coches averiados en tiempo real para robarlos o agredir a sus ocupantes, especialmente de noche o en zonas aisladas. Por ello, reclaman que la geolocalización quede restringida únicamente a las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad y se limite a un radio de entre dos y tres kilómetros.

Los hechos ocurrieron en febrero de 2023, cuando la víctima confesó que su padre la había agredido sexualmente y grabado escenas explícitas con ella, tras facilitarle cocaína y otras sustancias. La denuncia llevó a la detención del sospechoso, M.A.S.S., quien fue imputado por agresión sexual, elaboración de pornografía infantil, exhibicionismo y delitos contra la salud pública. Sin embargo, casi tres años después, el procedimiento judicial sigue estancado sin escrito de acusación por parte de la Fiscalía, lo que permite que el acusado continúe en libertad, manteniendo su vida normal en Palma.

Este nombramiento, publicado a finales de diciembre y con efectos desde el 5 de ese mes, garantiza a Cuenca un salario público de aproximadamente 58.000 euros brutos anuales y, a diferencia de otros asesores políticos, sin un límite temporal definido.

Cuenca, considerado uno de los colaboradores más cercanos y de máxima confianza de Mazón, ha desempeñado un papel relevante durante la etapa del expresidente y se encuentra además implicado en un proceso judicial relacionado con la gestión de la dana, por el que ha tenido que declarar en varias ocasiones y afronta un careo judicial.

La operación, denominada 'Mosenik', permitió descubrir en Barcelona una 'granja' compuesta por equipos informáticos con casi 900 módems y cientos de tarjetas SIM, capaces de emitir hasta 2,5 millones de mensajes y miles de llamadas diarias. El responsable, un informático ucraniano de 41 años con experiencia en multinacionales, ofrecía este sistema a redes internacionales de ciberdelincuentes a cambio de dinero. Su base de operaciones estaba oculta tras una cafetería que servía de tapadera para registrar líneas telefónicas y gestionar la infraestructura valorada en unos 400.000 euros.

Nació en la semana 29 de gestación junto a su hermana gemela, en un parto que puso en peligro la vida de su madre por un desprendimiento de placenta. Llegó al mundo sin vida y con una hemorragia cerebral que derivó en una hidrocefalia y una parálisis cerebral. Los médicos no esperaban que sobreviviera, y sus padres apenas aspiraban a que algún día llegara a ver sombras o pronunciara tres sílabas. Sin embargo, Roque ha desafiado todos los diagnósticos. Ha pasado por más de cincuenta operaciones, incluyendo dos episodios en los que estuvo clínicamente muerto, pero asegura que su vida está “mejor que nunca” desde que le retiraron la válvula de drenaje que lo mantenía con vida.

En un vídeo difundido por visitantes del recinto, se observa a un muntjac chino macho —una especie de ciervo de pequeño tamaño originaria de Asia— enfrentarse a un rinoceronte que supera ampliamente su tamaño y peso, con más de 1,7 toneladas. A primera vista, la escena parece insólita, pero según el personal del zoológico, tiene una explicación biológica bastante lógica.

Los cuidadores del parque explicaron que la hembra de muntjac se encontraba en celo, lo que activó el comportamiento territorial del macho. Este tipo de conducta es habitual entre los muntjacs, que suelen mostrar agresividad para defender su espacio o su pareja durante el periodo reproductivo. Aunque el enfrentamiento con un animal tan grande como un rinoceronte resulta inofensivo para este último, el vídeo muestra cómo el pequeño ciervo se planta con seguridad, sin mostrar miedo.

El evangelismo se caracteriza por su énfasis en la lectura de la Biblia como autoridad suprema, la conversión personal, el bautismo de creyentes y la evangelización activa.
