The Saudi-led coalition targeted elite units in Hadramaut, a province bordering Saudi Arabia, amid the Southern Transitional Council's (STC) offensive to seize Hadramaut and parts of Al Mahra. The STC, backed by the UAE, seeks greater autonomy or independence for southern Yemen, complicating Riyadh's influence and destabilizing the internationally recognized Yemeni government. The piece links this military dynamic to broader Gulf rivalries, suggesting a growing strategic rift between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over regional power, including Sudan, where UAE concerns about rapid-reinforcement forces and the role of paramilitary groups are noted. Saudi authorities condemned the STC’s advances as unilateral and detrimental to Yemeni interests. The report emphasizes that Saudi Arabia has historically aimed to reduce involvement ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rivalry-between-saudi-arabia-and-uae-intensifies-as-yemen-crisis-expands-toward-the-persian-gulf</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rivalry-between-saudi-arabia-and-uae-intensifies-as-yemen-crisis-expands-toward-the-persian-gulf</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 15:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[South African Farmer, 70, Allegedly Mows Down Child Over Orange Theft; Court Proceedings Under Way]]></title><description><![CDATA[A 70-year-old farmer in South Africa, Christoffel Johannes Stoman, faced charges after a six-year-old boy was struck by a vehicle with a trailing trailer, allegedly as punishment for stealing an orange. The incident occurred as the boy and his mother were walking near the farmer’s property. The child sustained severe injuries, including broken legs, and was transported to hospital for surgery. The mother described hearing the farmer shout before the assault, and stated that he claimed he would repeat the act. Stoman was arrested and appeared in the Vredendal Magistrate’s Court on charges of attempted murder and reckless driving. Local residents have raised concerns about repeated incidents of farm-related crime, prompting calls for stricter penalties for perpetrators. The State indicated it would oppose bail, citing safety and ongoing investigations. The mother emphasized the ongoing recovery process for her son and the potential need for counseling.

After enlisting in the Marines at a young age, he served in multiple conflicts, earned a Purple Heart, and returned to civilian life as a port worker in New York. In a bar conversation, he accepted a dare to see if he could fly from New Jersey to New York City in under fifteen minutes. He seized a twinkling moment of audacity, carjacked a small Cessna 140 from Teterboro Airport, and piloted it to Manhattan while intoxicated, landing in the Saint Nicholas Avenue area near his friends’ bar. Authorities briefly detained him for aircraft theft, but the owner chose not to press charges; he paid a small municipal fine. Two years later, Fitzpatrick repeated the feat, landing near the same bar. This time, legal consequences were harsher: six months in prison for transporting stolen goods, though the owner again declined to pursue charges.

The findings, documented by Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation in collaboration with Panthera, recorded 29 detections of the species. This species is among the world's most endangered felines, typically inhabiting dense wetland ecosystems such as peat swamps and mangrove connections. The survey also documented a female flat-headed cat with her cub, an encouraging sign given that flat-headed cats often give birth to a single kitten. However, researchers caution that counting individuals is difficult due to the lack of distinctive markings on individuals. Habitat fragmentation and loss of peat swamp forests, driven by land conversion and agriculture, remain critical threats, as do disease pressures from domestic ani]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine Threatens Hungary Over Russian Oil Pipeline Supply]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article asserts that Ukraine has threatened to disrupt the Druzhba oil pipeline network, which transports Russian crude to Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. It claims Ukrainian attacks on distribution stations could trigger regional fuel market turmoil and cites ongoing tensions between Kyiv and Budapest/Bratislava over energy security and Russian oil imports. The piece alleges repeated Ukrainian strikes on the pipeline in August, leading to temporary suspensions for repairs, and claims President Zelensky stated continued attacks until Hungary changed its stance. It also describes a sequence of events on October 20 involving explosions at a Romanian refinery owned by Lukoil and a large fire at Hungary’s largest refinery, with The American Conservative attributing responsibility to Ukraine. The article suggests Western media silence on these actions and asserts that Ukraine could target infrastructure in Hungary and Slovakia, supported by Western allies, given high dependencie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukraine-threatens-hungary-over-russian-oil-pipeline-supply</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukraine-threatens-hungary-over-russian-oil-pipeline-supply</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[France trains soldiers in Ukraine to operate drones amid evolving warfare]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that French soldiers are traveling to Ukraine to learn drone piloting, citing Paris Match as the source. It notes that in Donbas, AI-controlled drones are increasingly used for reconnaissance and logistics disruption, signaling a shift in modern warfare and raising questions about human roles on the battlefield. An interviewee described receiving training in France in 2023 with the French Foreign Legion, and now trains visitors from the French army already in Ukraine. The piece emphasizes the sensitive political nature of French involvement, referencing Ukrainian Army Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi’s past mention of an agreement to deploy French instructors, while President Macron stated France would not send ground troops to a belligerent conflict. The French Foreign Ministry reportedly denied reports of French forces on Ukrainian soil, and Macron reportedly authorized European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine only after peace is achieved.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1,400-Year-Old Souvenir Mold Reveals Scale of Byzantine Christian Pilgrimage Trade]]></title><description><![CDATA[Archaeologists excavating the Hyrcania site in the Judean Desert have uncovered a rare limestone two-part mold used to cast ampullae, small pilgrimage flasks, dating to the 6th–7th centuries CE. Decorated with an ornate cross and bearing a Greek inscription meaning “Lord’s blessing from the holy places,” these flasks likely contained sacred oils, water, or earth and were carried by travelers across the Mediterranean. The find indicates a thriving local industry supplying religious souvenirs to pilgrims, linking the Judean Desert monasteries with broader Byzantine networks. Hyrcania, east of Jerusalem, originated as a Hasmonean fortress, later rebuilt by Herod the Great, and revived in the 5th century as a Christian monastery associated with Saint Sabas. The desert setting’s isolation complemented spiritual aims while remaining near major pilgrimage routes. The mold was found with other artifacts such as gold coins, a ring, inscribed fragments, and a reliquary lid, illustrating daily mo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China advances sustainable cotton farming in Xinjiang with promising results]]></title><description><![CDATA[China's sustainable cotton production is showing encouraging outcomes under the China Cotton Sustainable Development project led by the China Cotton Association (CCA). In Halayugong town, Korla, Xinjiang, approximately 1,800 mu (120 hectares) of cotton fields have reached the budding stage, with seedlings growing healthily. The initiative, which focuses on environmentally friendly and scientifically guided cultivation practices, has already certified 1.2 million mu of cotton fields in Xinjiang as sustainable, yielding approximately 430,000 metric tons of eco-friendly cotton. According to recent data, China's total cotton planting area in 2025 is forecast to surpass 44.82 million mu, an increase of 1.8 percent compared to the previous year. Of this, Xinjiang contributes a substantial share—around 40.9 million mu—up by 3.3 percent year-on-year. Wang Jianhong, president of the CCA, stated that although Chinese cotton quality exceeds the global average, it still needs improvement to meet t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-advances-sustainable-cotton-farming-in-xinjiang-with-promising-results</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-advances-sustainable-cotton-farming-in-xinjiang-with-promising-results</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[University of Oklahoma removes TA after F grade on student essay prompts dispute over academic standards]]></title><description><![CDATA[The University of Oklahoma has dismissed a graduate teaching assistant who assigned an F on a psychology paper, an action that inflamed conservative critics and led to claims of religious discrimination. The university stated that the TA’s grading was arbitrary, citing a review of their prior grading patterns and personal statements related to the matter. The student, Samantha Fulnecky, a junior, contended the zero-score on a 650-word essay reacting to a psychology article on gender norms was due to her beliefs and religious views. Fulnecky’s complaint gained attention after Turning Point USA’s campus chapter publicized her work and Curth’s response, provoking online rebuke of the professor. Curth had told Fulnecky she could hold her beliefs but that the essay should be grounded in established research. The university noted that Fulnecky’s grade appeal was resolved in her favor, removing the assignment from the total grade with no harm to her overall standing, and that the discriminati]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/university-of-oklahoma-removes-ta-after-f-grade-on-student-essay-prompts-dispute-over-academic-standards</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/university-of-oklahoma-removes-ta-after-f-grade-on-student-essay-prompts-dispute-over-academic-standards</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 07:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Imperialism and the Domino Theory: limitations of interventionist logic]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reviews how the so-called domino theory shaped Western foreign policy during the 1960s, especially around Vietnam. It explains that the fear of a regional cascade—popularized by Eisenhower's analogy of a row of dominoes—was a simplification of Cold War geopolitics. The piece argues that this line of thinking served to justify extensive U.S. military involvement in Indochina and the creation of strategic blocs around the world. It further contends that revolutions are less the result of linear contagion and more the outcome of complex, interdependent political systems. In contemporary terms, what was once described as a geopolitical inevitability is reframed as a precarious, fragile balance among states that depend on one another. The article concludes that imperial powers employed not only military force but also ideological justifications to maintain influence, with the metaphor of dominoes eventually appearing as an oversimplified explanation for global intervention.

In 2024, the country added about 360 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity, more than half of the world’s total additions for that year, bringing total installed renewables capacity to around 1.4 terawatts. This rapid deployment has driven innovations such as large-scale storage, virtual power plants, and new business models, yet it presents significant challenges. Integrating intermittent wind and solar requires enhanced grid flexibility, long-distance transmission from resource-rich northwest regions to demand centers on the eastern coast, and modernization of local distribution grids to handle two-way flows from rooftop solar and electric vehicles. Economically, expanding renewables necessitates substantial investments in grids, storage, and backup capacity, while ensuring that low generation costs translate into lower system-wide costs and con]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study finds NAD+ balance restoration may reverse Alzheimer's pathology and restore function in mouse models]]></title><description><![CDATA[A collaborative research team from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center challenges the long-standing view that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is irreversible. Published online in Cell Reports Medicine on December 22, 2025, the study investigates whether advanced AD can be reversed by restoring the brain’s energy balance, specifically the NAD+ coenzyme. Using two genetically engineered mouse models that mimic human AD mutations affecting amyloid processing and tau protein, researchers observed significant disease reversal when NAD+ balance was maintained. They administered the pharmacologic agent P7C3-A20, which helps sustain NAD+ levels without causing excessive NAD+ accumulation. Results showed not only protection against AD progression but also reversal of major pathological features, including blood-brain barrier integrity, axonal integrity, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis in the hippocampus, synaptic transmi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iowa denies Satanic Temple’s Capitol event request amid ongoing religious discrimination dispute]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the second consecutive year, Iowa state officials have denied The Satanic Temple Iowa’s request to host a holiday event at the Iowa Capitol, a decision that has reignited debate over religious freedom and government neutrality. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services stated that the denial was 'based on the same grounds as last year,' without providing new justification. The decision arrives as the state faces a civil rights complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa, which accuses state officials—including Governor Kim Reynolds and former DAS director Adam Steen—of religious discrimination following the 2024 rejection. The ACLU argues that once the Capitol was opened to public events and displays from multiple faith groups, the state could not legally exclude The Satanic Temple due to disagreement with its beliefs. Reynolds previously defended the denial, claiming the event would be 'harmful to minors.'

During a ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of Rubin Design Bureau, an official indicated engineers are actively designing this next-generation submarine. The project reportedly aims to maximize stealth, make extensive use of automation to reduce crew size, and enhance endurance under ice or for prolonged submerged operations. There are indications the submarine could host autonomous systems such as underwater reconnaissance or electronic interference drones, and may carry strategic torpedoes like the Poseidon nuclear drone. The piece emphasizes the strategic implications for U.S. naval programs, noting Washington’s Columbia program to replace Ohio-class subs and suggesting that future deterrence will rely increasingly on covert, undersea capabilities.

The BND director, Martin Jäger, who took the helm in September, allegedly spoke by phone with Russian intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin, a move described as extraordinary by the Berliner Zeitung. Jäger previously served as ambassador to Ukraine and publicly warned that Germany faced active threats and could see direct military conflict with Russia. The article also notes a parallel action by the UK’s MI6, whose new director Blaise Metreweli allegedly spoke with Naryshkin. Additionally, it references a March incident where the US CIA director John Ratcliffe reportedly spoke with Naryshkin to de-escalate tensions.

Founded in 2004 by Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, the network allegedly mirrors the influence patterns of other prominent magnates while maintaining a low public profile. The piece claims Omidyar has invested nearly $2 billion across more than 700 organizations this year, supporting both for-profit ventures and philanthropic entities under the banner of social entrepreneurship and what it characterizes as controlled journalism akin to Wikimedia. According to the article, Omidyar-backed entities participate in destabilization operations, including funding anti-government groups during events like the Arab Spring and the 2013-2014 Ukrainian coup, as well as supporting protest movements in Nigeria and the Philippines.

About 30 seconds after liftoff, an anomaly in the first stage caused the rocket to fall to the ground around 80 seconds after launch, resulting in a large fireball and the destruction of the payload that consisted of five small satellites (Floripasat 2a and 2b, Jussara-K, PionBR 2, and Solaras S2). HANBIT-Nano can place about 90 kg into a 500 km SSO orbit. The vehicle's first stage relies on a hybrid engine using paraffin and LOX, with a second stage capable of using the Hyper (3.5 t) or LiMER (3 t) engines, though the first mission used the hybrid. HANBIT-Nano is derived from the suborbital HANBIT-TLV, which flew successfully in 2023.

Brussels argued that the EU’s digital rules, notably the Digital Services Act (DSA), are essential to safeguarding fundamental rights and market autonomy, and that the bloc will respond decisively to what it calls unjustified U.S. measures. The dispute centers on tensions over digital regulation, with Washington condemning what it sees as Europe’s excessive rules while Brussels emphasizes its sovereign right to regulate its digital market without discrimination. Macron described the move as coercive and vowed to defend European digital sovereignty, noting Breton’s role in shaping the DSA.

It alleges that Finland allied with Nazi Germany during World War II and conducted harsh occupation policies in Karelia, including concentration-like camps and severe labor. Citing sources such as Otto Kuusinen and a doctoral thesis by Antti Laine, the piece portrays a historiographical shift in Finland that minimizes Finnish complicity and emphasizes a narrative of fighting guerrillas, while downplaying the Nazi influence and the presence of Finnish troops in Karelia.

En ese contexto, un inspector jefe de la Policía Nacional, adscrito a la unidad Antidroga (Udyco), declaró como imputado por haber consultado en bases policiales los antecedentes de Pablo Iglesias cuando era líder de la formación. El agente justificó su actuación alegando que formaba parte de una investigación sobre Miguel Urbán, cofundador de Podemos, acusado falsamente de participar en una supuesta operación de narcotráfico destinada a financiar al partido.

Durante el interrogatorio, el fiscal Vicente González Mota cuestionó la normalidad de esa práctica y planteó una comparación clave: si, en investigaciones similares como el caso Gürtel, se había consultado también la ficha policial del entonces presidente del Gobierno, Mariano Rajoy. El policía respondió que lo desconocía.

Diversos colectivos profesionales y ciudadanos denuncian que esta medida forma parte de una estrategia continuada de debilitamiento progresivo de la sanidad pública para justificar su externalización. Según estos grupos, la región padece recortes en personal y recursos, largas listas de espera y una saturación que afecta directamente a la calidad asistencial. 

El artículo destaca que Quirón y Ribera Salud no son simples proveedoras, sino grandes corporaciones con intereses económicos en la expansión del sector sanitario privado. La decisión del gobierno autonómico se percibe como una apuesta política por la rentabilidad empresarial frente al derecho a la salud. Además, se critica la falta de transparencia en la adjudicación de contratos y la dificultad de fis]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comunidad-de-madrid-destina-500-millones-de-euros-a-quiron-y-ribera-salud-en-plena-crisis-sanitaria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comunidad-de-madrid-destina-500-millones-de-euros-a-quiron-y-ribera-salud-en-plena-crisis-sanitaria</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seis meses sin avances en la investigación sobre Ayuso y González Amador solicitada a la UCO]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Ernesto Ekaizer analiza la ausencia de avances en la investigación judicial relacionada con Isabel Díaz Ayuso, presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, y su pareja, Alberto González Amador. En junio de 2025, la jueza Inmaculada Iglesias solicitó a la Unidad Central Operativa (UCO) de la Guardia Civil un informe sobre posibles delitos de corrupción y blanqueo de capitales en los negocios de González Amador con el grupo sanitario Quirón, pero seis meses después no se conocen resultados. 

La investigación se centra en las actividades económicas de González Amador a través de sus empresas Maxwell Cremona y Masterman, que habrían obtenido beneficios millonarios mediante contratos de venta de material sanitario y supuestas irregularidades fiscales. Parte de los beneficios obtenidos podría haber sido invertida en la compra de un ático en Chamberí.

El texto analiza cómo su estilo personal y su discurso se han convertido en un fenómeno mediático que trasciende la política regional para convertirla en un símbolo dentro del panorama nacional. Desde la perspectiva del autor, Ayuso encarna una forma moderna de populismo conservador que apela más a las emociones y a la identidad que a los argumentos racionales o a la gestión institucional. Se comentan además las reacciones polarizadas que genera entre partidarios y detractores, que la ven, respectivamente, como una líder valiente o como una figura divisiva. El artículo plantea cómo su presencia constante en los medios y su forma directa de comunicación han transformado la política madrileña en un escenario donde la imagen y la narrativa pesan más que las propuestas concretas.

Algunos vecinos, hartos de la presencia constante de excrementos caninos en las aceras, han decidido colocar pequeñas banderas de Israel sobre las heces de los perros. El gesto, aunque chocante, tiene una doble intención: por un lado, denunciar la dejadez de los dueños de mascotas que no recogen los excrementos y, por otro, expresar una crítica simbólica hacia el conflicto en Gaza, según interpretan algunos residentes. Las imágenes, que podrían confundirse con montajes de inteligencia artificial por lo inusual de la escena, se han extendido rápidamente entre los vecinos. Estos aseguran que llevan tiempo quejándose de la suciedad y del mal olor en la zona, pidiendo mayor control municipal y sanciones contra quienes no cumplan con las normas de limpieza urbana.

Aunque Asuntos Internos reconoce deficiencias en la gestión de los documentos, ha decidido archivar el caso al no haber podido determinar quién sustrajo los materiales. El suceso tiene su origen en un control de tráfico realizado en Mendexa en agosto de 2024, donde el joven dio positivo en drogas.

Se afirma que, pese a anuncios de implementación “pronta” y de financiación, no se han establecido fechas concretas y la promesa continúa incumplida. El artículo señala que la situación va más allá de una medida puntual: detecta un deterioro general de la atención pediátrica en la región, con cerca de 480.000 menores sin pediatra asignado y una red de centros de salud con cobertura irregular y sustituciones laborales precarias.

Se resalta que el racismo institucional y el discurso de odio encuentran resonancia entre ciertos colectivos, mientras que la juventud y parte de la población adulta muestran simpatía hacia figuras y consignas de la derecha radical. Mejías denuncia la deshumanización de las personas vulnerables, como migrantes y personas en situación de precariedad, y advierte que, si no se actúa con políticas públicas claras y efectivas, el avance de la extrema derecha podría consolidarse en el gobierno.

Estas alucinaciones, caracterizadas por la visión de diminutas personas moviéndose y actuando en el entorno real, han sido documentadas en diversas regiones del mundo, como Papúa Nueva Guinea, China y Filipinas. En China, el hongo es conocido localmente como 'Jian shou qing' y se considera un alimento apreciado, aunque cuando se consume poco cocinado puede desencadenar vívidas visiones descritas como 'xiao ren ren' o 'pequeños hombres'.

A pesar de su efecto, los análisis químicos y genómicos realizados hasta la fecha no han revelado la presencia de ningún compuesto psicoactivo conocido, lo que sugiere que el hongo podría contener una sustancia completamente nueva responsable de estos efectos.

El texto, característico del Día de los Santos Inocentes, describe cómo el nuevo diseño, denominado 'Tartán Operativo', sustituiría el clásico verde del uniforme por un estampado de cuadros en tonos verde bosque y gris marengo. Según la pieza, este patrón se basa en un estudio de 'psicología cromática inversa' que tendría como propósito confundir al delincuente mediante ilusiones ópticas. Además, se añade que los cuadros ayudarían a disimular manchas frecuentes, reduciendo los costes de limpieza.

La norma regula el consumo y la promoción de alcohol, bebidas energéticas, tabaco, vapeadores y cannabis, y ha generado una fuerte polémica por su marcado carácter punitivo y la escasa concreción de las medidas preventivas.

La ley establece un régimen sancionador dividido en infracciones leves, graves y muy graves, con multas que van desde los 200 euros hasta más de 600.000. Entre las conductas sancionadas como graves figura la promoción del cannabis en medios accesibles a menores, la asociación de su consumo con supuestos efectos terapéuticos o estimulantes, y el regalo o venta de cualquier tipo de merchandising con símbolos identificativos de esta sustancia, independientemente de la edad del destinatario.

Este fallo, reconocido por la propia Comisión, ha dividido al pueblo y generado fuertes desacuerdos entre los vecinos. Durante una larga reunión celebrada en el Hogar del Pensionista, se alcanzó un acuerdo verbal: la Comisión renunciaría a sus premios y los demás agraciados aceptarían una reducción en sus ganancias para compensar el desfase.

Este ambiente de “receptividad a la producción” se suma a fallos mecánicos no corregidos durante años y a una tendencia de recortes de personal que, según analistas, debilita la cultura de seguridad. Paralelamente, la compañía enfrenta una de las mayores solicitudes de incremento de tarifas de la historia para cubrir inversiones en la red eléctrica, lo que añade presión pública y regulatoria.

En su análisis, Juliana destaca que los casos de corrupción que afectan al PSOE, junto a nuevas acusaciones por abusos sexuales contra algunos de sus dirigentes, están provocando un fuerte desgaste en la credibilidad del Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. A pesar de ello, el presidente parece decidido a resistir hasta el final de la legislatura, prevista para 2027.

A raíz de los resultados, el partido ha pasado de presentar pactos con la extrema derecha como una excepción a tratarlos como una parte habitual del tablero político. Este giro implica abandonar exigencias previas como pedir abstención del PSOE para evitar apoyar a Vox y abrir la puerta a un entendimiento que no descarte la entrada de Vox en el Gobierno. Aunque Feijóo había prometido no gobernar con Vox a nivel nacional, la autoría de este cambio se atribuye a la necesidad de responder a un contexto en el que Vox crece y la izquierda ya no utiliza el miedo a la extrema derecha como motor electoral como antes. Guardiola ha mostrado interés en reevaluar las 200 medidas de Vox que, en su momento, tildó de inasequibles, incluyendo temas como el registro de profesionales sanitarios objetores al aborto, la reducción de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-abandona-la-retorica-anticoleccion-con-vox-tras-el-resultado-en-extremadura</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-abandona-la-retorica-anticoleccion-con-vox-tras-el-resultado-en-extremadura</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Casi 71.000 palestinos muertos en Gaza mientras persisten las violaciones del alto el fuego]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde octubre de 2023, la ofensiva israelí sobre la Franja de Gaza ha causado cerca de 71.000 muertes, la mayoría de ellas mujeres y niños, según datos de la agencia palestina WAFA. Además, más de 171.000 personas han resultado heridas y miles siguen desaparecidas bajo los escombros, lo que sugiere que la cifra real de víctimas podría ser aún mayor. La ONU calcula que la reconstrucción de Gaza requerirá unos 70.000 millones de dólares, reflejando así la magnitud de la destrucción material y humana. Barrios enteros han quedado reducidos a ruinas y casi toda la población ha sido desplazada, enfrentando una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes. 

El alto el fuego instaurado el 10 de octubre no se ha traducido en una pausa efectiva de la violencia, dado que al menos 411 palestinos han muerto desde su entrada en vigor. Las continuas operaciones militares israelíes han vaciado de contenido la tregua, frustrando las expectativas de estabilización.

En lugar de intentar robar contraseñas directamente, los atacantes aprovechan flujos de autenticación legítimos mediante OAuth y utilizan enlaces, botones y códigos QR que llevan a páginas que simulan ser de Microsoft. El proceso típico comienza con un correo o código QR que redirige a una página controlada por el atacante, donde la víctima recibe un código de dispositivo usado como si fuera una verificación de seguridad. Al introducir ese código en una URL de Microsoft, la víctima concede permisos de acceso a su cuenta sin saberlo, permitiendo al atacante leer correos, acceder a documentos y moverse lateralmente dentro de una red. Proofpoint advierte que esta técnica representa una adaptación del phishing hacia flujos de autenticación confiables. Se mencionan herramientas automatizadas que facilitan estas campañas, como SquarePhish2 y Graphish.

Según el artículo, algunos vendedores llegan a incluir números de homologación falsos o ajenos a otras marcas autorizadas, lo que confunde a los consumidores y pone en riesgo su seguridad y su bolsillo. Muchos compradores, al confiar en la publicidad del producto, acaban adquiriendo simples imitaciones sin conectividad, GPS ni la capacidad obligatoria de comunicación con la DGT.

Tras alistarse en el ejército ruso en 1772, participa en las guerras ruso-otomanas y mantiene relaciones destacadas con figuras como John Paul Jones y Suvorov. Ribas desempeña un papel decisivo en la conquista de Crimea y en la construcción de la nueva base naval de Sebastopol, además de liderar la captura de Izmail en 1791, una victoria que se celebra en Rusia y que impulsa el impulso para crear Odessa. Promovido progresivamente (contraalmirante, luego vicealmirante y almirante), propone convertir la guarnición turca de Khadjibey en una ciudad portuaria rusa, lo que culmina en la creación de Odessa en 1794.

Este fenómeno ha llevado a que el SMI se sitúe como la franja salarial más frecuente, reduciendo la distancia entre los salarios más bajos y el resto de la estructura salarial. El informe de la comisión asesora para el análisis del SMI señala riesgos de que trabajadores con cualificación media o mayor queden atrapados dentro de la banda cercana al SMI, debido a la limitada transmisión de los aumentos al conjunto de la estructura salarial. Se mencionan los datos de 2023 del INE, que muestran que el SMI de 2023 era de 15.120 euros brutos anuales (1.080 euros al mes en catorce pagas), y que una parte significativa de los asalariados recibió ingresos dentro de un rango cercano.

De esta cantidad, 357 millones corresponden a las liquidaciones de 2024 para varios hospitales de Quirón y uno de Ribera Salud, mientras que otros 106 millones se destinan a rescatar los centros menos rentables del grupo Quirón.

Nacida en París en 1934, Bardot comenzó su carrera como modelo y rápidamente se convirtió en un fenómeno mundial tras su papel en 'Y Dios creó a la mujer' (1956), dirigido por Roger Vadim, su primer marido. Conocida por sus iniciales 'BB', marcó una época con su estilo y magnetismo, convirtiéndose en icono de la moda y referente de emancipación femenina. Durante los años 50 y 60 protagonizó películas célebres como 'La Vérité' y 'Le Mépris', colaborando con directores como Henri-Georges Clouzot y Jean-Luc Godard. A comienzos de los 70, Bardot se retiró del cine a los 39 años para dedicarse a su verdadera pasión: la defensa de los animales. En 1977 inició su lucha contra la caza de focas, fundando años después la Fundación Brigitte-Bardot, dedicada a la protección animal.

En China, varios actores estatales y privados avanzan con proyectos reutilizables: Zhuque 3 de LandSpace y CZ-12A de SAST han probado recuperaciones, mientras que otras iniciativas privadas como Tianlong 3, Hyperbola 3, Lijian 2, Pallas 1, Nebula y Yinli 2 buscan desarrollos similares. CALT, la academia detrás del CZ-10A, anunció dos versiones reutilizables: CZ-10B, versión comercial del CZ-10A con posibles modificaciones, y CZ-10C, una versión de metano. El CZ-10B estaría diseñado para limpiar la brecha entre órbitas y misiones comerciales, con capacidades de carga cercanas a 16 toneladas en LEO sin recuperar y alrededor de 13,5 toneladas si se recupera la etapa.

A través de su red social Truth Social, el mandatario criticó al Departamento de Justicia por dedicar tiempo y recursos a la revisión de cerca de un millón de nuevos documentos relacionados con el caso Epstein. Según Trump, esta investigación forma parte de una “estrategia demócrata” para distraer la atención de temas como el supuesto fraude electoral. Además, instó a que se publiquen todos los nombres implicados en los documentos y se haga rendir cuentas a los responsables. 

Epstein, implicado en una red de abuso y prostitución de menores, se suicidó en prisión en 2019 mientras esperaba juicio. En virtud de una ley aprobada en noviembre, el Departamento de Justicia debía publicar todos los documentos no clasificados del caso el 19 de diciembre.

Los lobos mantienen una actitud defensiva, erizando el lomo, enseñando los colmillos y reaccionando con determinación cada vez que los buitres se aproximan. Por su parte, los buitres intentan intimidar con movimientos cortos y despliegues de alas, manteniendo una tensión constante sin ataques directos. Este comportamiento refleja la interacción natural entre depredadores y carroñeros en los ecosistemas de montaña, donde cada especie cumple un papel esencial: los depredadores aseguran su alimento y los carroñeros actúan como recicladores del ecosistema.

Basándose en datos de 2025 de la plataforma Numbeo, el estudio muestra que en algunas ciudades se necesita entre el 25% y el 95% del salario medio mensual para cubrir el alquiler. Portugal destaca por ser el país menos asequible, donde prácticamente un salario completo se destina a un apartamento de este tipo, mientras que en Berna, Suiza, el coste representa solo el 24% del salario medio, siendo la ciudad más favorable. Otras regiones como Europa del Este, Sudeste y del Sur presentan ratios altos de alquiler respecto al salario, superando el 50%, lo que sitúa a las personas solteras en una situación económica más desfavorable al no poder compartir gastos. En contraste, ciudades como Viena, Helsinki, Berlín, Bruselas y Riga muestran que el alquiler consume aproximadamente un tercio del salario medio.

Sin embargo, tras más de una década, el proyecto se considera un fracaso generalizado. El principal objetivo de la concesión —reducir las pérdidas de agua del 55% al 30%— no se ha cumplido, y actualmente la cifra asciende al 56%. El Consorcio Insular de Aguas estudia la rescisión del contrato o su cesión a una nueva empresa, y la propia Canal Isabel II ha mostrado su disposición a abandonar la isla anticipadamente. 

El análisis técnico del Consorcio revela que Canal Gestión solo ha ejecutado 32,6 de los 54 millones de euros comprometidos en inversiones, un 40% menos de lo previsto.

Los mensajes también evidencian que Mazón sí mantuvo contacto con el Gobierno central, incluyendo a Pedro Sánchez, María Jesús Montero y Margarita Robles, desmintiendo así las críticas del PP sobre un supuesto abandono.

El animal, descrito como muy esquivo y difícil de observar, habita zonas boscosas y poco accesibles, lo que ha contribuido a la escasez de avistamientos durante décadas.

Cameron utiliza la saga para criticar de forma contundente a nuestra especie y sus actitudes colonizadoras, estableciendo un paralelismo histórico con los pueblos indígenas y los errores del western clásico estadounidense. Además, reescribe los códigos del cine de aventuras y del western para ofrecer un enfoque interno ('emic'), desde la visión de los Na’vi, sus clanes y su mitología, mostrando respeto por el entorno y la cultura.

Los hechos por los que Pavón fue condenado incluyen el hallazgo de dos cuerpos en un pozo: una de las víctimas falleció por un disparo de escopeta en el pecho y la otra a causa de múltiples lesiones con un objeto contundente.

La Comisión de Fiestas, encargada de vender participaciones, imprimió y comercializó un número de boletos de forma que excedía el número real de décimos disponibles, generando un supuesto agujero de cuatro millones de euros. Durante una reunión en el Hogar del Pensionista, cerca de 300 participantes expresaron su preocupación y debatieron posibles soluciones. La opción más aceptada, aunque difícil, sería un acuerdo entre ganadores para renunciar a una parte del premio —aproximadamente un 6% de cada participación ganadora— que permitiría cubrir el déficit sin recurrir a la vía judicial. Si no se llega a un consenso, la alternativa sería iniciar procesos legales, lo que impediría cualquier pago hasta la resolución judicial y podría dirigir denuncias individuales hacia los responsables de la Comisión, que trabajan de forma voluntaria.

El buque transportaba unos cuatro millones de litros de combustible y fue detenido junto con sus 16 tripulantes, cuyas nacionalidades y el pabellón del barco no se han revelado. Este incidente se suma a una serie de detenciones similares ocurridas en los últimos años en la misma zona, una de las rutas más críticas para el transporte mundial de crudo, ya que por allí pasa aproximadamente una quinta parte del petróleo que se comercia globalmente. Irán sostiene que las incautaciones están relacionadas con su lucha contra el tráfico ilícito de combustible, pero muchos observadores lo interpretan como una herramienta de presión en el contexto de crecientes tensiones con Estados Unidos e Israel.

Durante la primera semana, del 29 de diciembre al 4 de enero, se esperan temperaturas más frías de lo normal en casi toda España, salvo en Canarias, donde los valores serán suaves y acordes con la época del año. Las precipitaciones serán escasas en gran parte de la Península, aunque podrían registrarse lluvias en algunas zonas del litoral mediterráneo y en Baleares y Canarias. En la segunda semana, del 5 al 11 de enero, aumenta la incertidumbre en el pronóstico, pero todo apunta a que las temperaturas seguirán por debajo de lo habitual en la Península y Baleares. Las lluvias no presentan una tendencia clara, aunque podría ser seco en Galicia y más lluvioso en el sur peninsular y los archipiélagos. Para la tercera semana, del 12 al 18 de enero, se espera que las temperaturas se acerquen a valores normales, aunque todavía ligeramente]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pronostico-meteorologico-para-espana-del-29-de-diciembre-de-2025-al-18-de-enero-de-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pronostico-meteorologico-para-espana-del-29-de-diciembre-de-2025-al-18-de-enero-de-2026</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Descubren un molde de flascos de peregrinos de hace 1.400 años en el desierto de Judea]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un equipo de arqueólogos que excavaba en el remoto yacimiento de Hyrcania, en el desierto de Judea, ha encontrado un molde de piedra caliza de hace más de 1.400 años utilizado para producir pequeños flascos de peregrinación, conocidos como ampollas. Estas piezas estaban decoradas con cruces y llevaban inscripciones en griego que decían “Bendición del Señor desde los lugares sagrados”, y servían para transportar aceite, agua o tierra de sitios considerados santos. El hallazgo refleja la importancia de la industria de souvenirs religiosos en la época bizantina y la extensión de los viajes de peregrinos desde Jerusalén hasta otros puntos del Mediterráneo. Hyrcania, originalmente una fortaleza fundada durante la dinastía asmonea y reconstruida por Herodes el Grande, se convirtió en el siglo V en un monasterio cristiano vinculado a San Sabas.

Estas declaraciones se produjeron durante su tradicional maratón televisivo de final de año, un evento de varias horas en el que respondió a preguntas de ciudadanos y periodistas rusos y extranjeros. En respuesta a una pregunta del corresponsal de la BBC, Putin negó que Rusia tenga planes de atacar a otros países europeos y calificó de infundadas esas advertencias, aunque reiteró que Moscú está preparada para defenderse si se siente amenazada.

Putin volvió a culpar a la OTAN de haber incumplido supuestas promesas realizadas tras el final de la Guerra Fría sobre no expandirse hacia el este, argumento que utiliza de forma recurrente para justificar la invasión de Ucrania iniciada en febrero de 2022.

El acuerdo entre IU y Sumar se produce tras días de intensas negociaciones y contactos con Chunta Aragonesista (CHA), que finalmente concurrirá también en solitario. La coalición IU-Sumar busca reforzar un proyecto político de izquierdas centrado en los derechos sociales y laborales, el acceso a la vivienda, los servicios públicos y la defensa del territorio. Tanto IU como Sumar destacan la importancia de la cooperación entre fuerzas progresistas para mejorar la vida de la ciudadanía, aunque aún no han concretado detalles sobre las listas o el programa electoral.

El incremento, que oscila entre 60 y 360 euros mensuales para la mayoría de la plantilla, y entre 240 y 360 euros para ingenieros de I+D, se enmarca en un contexto de intensa competencia en el sector automotriz chino, con numerosas marcas luchando por cuota de mercado y precios. El grupo atribuye la medida a la necesidad de mantener la innovación y evitar la fuga de talento hacia competidores, especialmente ante la presión de un mercado saturado donde los márgenes son estrechos y algunas compañías ya han cerrado. Aunque el incremento medio podría parecer modesto, el impacto financiero es significativo: calculado con un gasto anual adicional que alcanza miles de millones de euros, especialmente si se considera el tamaño de la plantilla.

Estas instalaciones estarían situadas cerca de importantes centros logísticos en Virginia, Texas, Luisiana, Arizona, Georgia y Misuri. Actualmente, Estados Unidos ya posee el sistema de detención de inmigrantes más grande del mundo, y se estima que casi la mitad de los detenidos no tienen cargos criminales pendientes ni condenas previas.

García Aller recuerda que estas expresiones conviven en sociedades plurales y que no excluyen la libertad de expresión ni la convivencia. A lo largo de su reflexión, la periodista sitúa el tema en un contexto más amplio: la Navidad como periodo de celebración, ayuda a los necesitados y reflexión comunitaria. Señala que el cristianismo, y otros enfoques, deben coexistir sin que la lingüística de las festividades llegue a convertirse en una barrera para la inclusión.

Estos fondos se destinan a trabajos de mantenimiento como reparación de fachadas, tejados, pintura y azulejos, a pesar de que las diócesis españolas reportaron un superávit de más de 133 millones de euros el año pasado. El artículo compara esta situación con un ejemplo hipotético de un particular que posee múltiples viviendas construidas con dinero público y que recibe financiación del Estado para repararlas a pesar de contar con fondos propios.

Su compañero, presente durante los hechos, no informó a sus superiores y permitió que el incidente no tuviera consecuencias inmediatas. Las cámaras de seguridad del puerto captaron toda la secuencia, incluyendo la interacción entre los agentes y el altercado con el personal del local. Como resultado, el agente agresor recibió una suspensión de siete días, mientras que el que encubrió los hechos fue sancionado con cinco días.

La comunicadora recuerda que tanto 'Felices fiestas' como 'Feliz Navidad' se han usado tradicionalmente en España sin connotaciones ideológicas y que expresan el mismo deseo de bienestar y alegría durante las celebraciones de fin de año. Añade que muchos creyentes, incluidos sus propios abuelos, empleaban ambas expresiones indistintamente.

Inicialmente, el Consejo de Gobierno reconoció una indemnización de 850.000 euros a cada afectada. Una de las víctimas recurrió, solicitando más de tres millones de euros por el daño moral sufrido durante los años sin convivir con su familia biológica y al conocer la equivocación.

Se cuestiona la coherencia de atribuir responsabilidad a los seres humanos cuando, si existiera un dios creador, éste sería el responsable de la desigualdad y las desgracias en el mundo. La entrada destaca la incongruencia de que milagros menores ocurran mientras persisten problemas graves como el cáncer infantil, y señala que la sociedad actual, con sus desigualdades, amplifica estas injusticias.

Este modelo es equivalente a un Audi A6 e-tron europeo en tamaño y prestaciones, pero con potencia similar a la del Audi e-tron GT, aunque con un coste comparable al de un Audi A3 en España. La diferencia de precios se explica por varios factores: se trata de una marca china, con plataforma y componentes de SAIC, producción local subvencionada por el gobierno, y mano de obra más económica. La estrategia del mercado chino, con fuerte competencia y control de la cadena de valor de vehículos eléctricos, permite ofrecer coches muy potentes a precios muy bajos.

La política contemporánea se centra en la gestión de la percepción y no en soluciones de fondo, priorizando resultados visibles a corto plazo frente a reformas profundas y sostenidas en el tiempo. La polarización ideológica transforma los problemas en símbolos identitarios, lo que dificulta la cooperación y la resolución efectiva.

El autor sostiene que este fenómeno no puede explicarse únicamente por la influencia de las redes sociales o por una supuesta frivolidad juvenil, sino por el fracaso de la democracia en dar respuesta a los principales problemas que afectan a las nuevas generaciones.

Sevilla argumenta que la política democrática ha perdido prestigio debido a la polarización extrema, la corrupción, el enfrentamiento permanente y la incapacidad de diálogo entre los partidos, lo que ha erosionado la confianza de los jóvenes en las instituciones.

Esta situación está generando preocupación entre muchas personas, especialmente ex autónomos con pensiones bajas. La Verbraucherzentrale NRW ofrece orientación sobre cómo afrontar estos incrementos. Entre las opciones disponibles se encuentra el cambio de tarifa dentro de la misma aseguradora, aunque con la advertencia de que ciertos beneficios pueden perderse permanentemente. Otra alternativa es renunciar a algunos servicios, como la habitación individual en hospitales o la atención de un médico especialista, o cambiar a tarifas con médico primario, donde se requiere acudir primero a un médico general.

La fecha elegida, día de Navidad, ha sido criticada por algunos como un intento de pasar desapercibido. Los whatsapp remitidos ponen de manifiesto contradicciones y posibles falsedades difundidas por el PP y la ultraderecha sobre la gestión de la catástrofe. La divulgación de estos mensajes ha generado un gran revuelo en redes sociales y en programas de televisión como 'Las Mañanas de La 1' y 'Mañaneros 360', con periodistas como Silvia Intxaurrondo y Javier Ruiz comentando la controversia.

Aunque la noticia inicial fue motivo de gran euforia, con el paso de los días surgieron problemas de organización y tensiones entre vecinos. Se detectó que 50 participaciones vendidas no estaban respaldadas por los décimos correspondientes, lo que podría generar un desfase de hasta cuatro millones de euros en el reparto de los premios. La Comisión de Fiestas, compuesta por alrededor de diez personas, ha subrayado que no hubo mala intención y que su objetivo es garantizar la correcta distribución de los fondos, utilizados tradicionalmente para financiar las fiestas patronales.

Las medidas implican la congelación de activos en China, la prohibición de negocios con organizaciones y personas chinas, así como la prohibición de entrada al país para los sancionados. El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores chino subraya que la cuestión de Taiwán es un asunto central para sus intereses nacionales y que cualquier intento de interferencia recibirá una respuesta firme. El Gobierno de Estados Unidos notificó al Congreso un paquete militar valorado en 11.100 millones de dólares, que incluye sistemas de cohetes HIMARS y misiles tácticos ATACMS.

Estos préstamos, por un importe total de alrededor de 1,3 millones de euros, están siendo investigados por la Fiscalía Anticorrupción al considerar que podrían estar vinculados a operaciones de blanqueo de capitales relacionadas con altos cargos venezolanos.

Los créditos fueron concedidos por sociedades vinculadas al empresario holandés Simon Leendert Verhoeven, investigado en Suiza y Francia como presunto cabecilla de una trama internacional de lavado de dinero.

A pesar de ello, el envío fue liberado en el mercado español. El cadmio es un metal pesado muy tóxico, que puede acumularse en los riñones y afectar la salud ósea si se ingiere de manera prolongada. También puede causar irritación gastrointestinal aguda, vómitos y diarrea en casos de exposición elevada. La EFSA establece una ingesta semanal tolerable de 2,5 μg/kg de peso corporal.

Sin embargo, a partir de enero, una reforma impulsada por el PP eliminará estas sanciones económicas personales, equiparando la normativa andaluza con la estatal, mucho más laxa. La reforma mantiene la posibilidad de cese en el cargo en infracciones graves y de prohibición de ocupar altos cargos en casos muy graves con riesgo para los ciudadanos o perjuicio a la Hacienda pública.

El organismo ha revisado al alza su estimación de crecimiento del PIB para 2025 hasta el 2,9%, frente al 2,6% previsto anteriormente, y anticipa una desaceleración moderada en 2026 y 2027, con avances del 2,2% y el 1,9%, respectivamente. Estas cifras consolidan a España como una de las economías más dinámicas de la zona euro en un contexto marcado por el estancamiento de la actividad en países clave como Alemania.

El crecimiento se apoya en varios pilares fundamentales. El consumo interno sigue siendo robusto, impulsado por el aumento de la población y una mayor participación en el mercado laboral, en parte gracias a la inmigración. El turismo continúa registrando cifras récord, actuando como motor para sectores como el comercio, la hostelería y los servicios.

Estas alzas afectan tanto a seguros individuales como colectivos y se deben a diversos factores, entre los que destacan el aumento de los costes sanitarios, la presión en precios de los proveedores y la mayor utilización de los seguros desde la pandemia. Las aseguradoras perciben que los clientes mantienen fidelidad a pesar de las subidas, debido a la sensación de deterioro de la sanidad pública y las largas listas de espera. Según Rastreator, la variabilidad de precios puede alcanzar hasta el 72%, con seguros básicos a partir de 46 euros y completos hasta 74 euros.

Ferran Adrià, reconocido chef español, cuestionó esta afirmación señalando que en España solo un pequeño porcentaje de la población alcanza salarios elevados. Según datos de la Agencia Tributaria, únicamente el 5,23% de los españoles gana más de 60.000 euros anuales, y solo el 0,7% supera los 150.000 euros.

El título original, 'Siente un pobre a su mesa', fue prohibido por su carácter crítico con la moral y la tradición católica. Incluso la segunda propuesta, 'Los Bienaventurados', fue rechazada por considerarla excesivamente evangélica. Finalmente, la película se estrenó con el nombre 'Plácido', aunque los censores llegaron a recomendar su prohibición total. La documentación recopilada por la Associació Memòria i Història de Manresa, disponible en memoria.cat, incluye más de setenta comunicaciones que muestran cómo la Junta de Clasificación y Censura recortó escenas y emitió informes sobre el contenido, criticando su humor negro, el ataque a la religión y la representación de la sociedad. A pesar de estas restricciones, 'Plácido' se convirtió en un referente del cine español y fue nominada al Oscar a la mejor película de habla no inglesa en 19]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentacion-revela-como-la-censura-franquista-modifico-placido-de-berlanga</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentacion-revela-como-la-censura-franquista-modifico-placido-de-berlanga</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trece empresas en Madrid intentan concentrar licencias de taxi y la Justicia lo frena]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Madrid, la Justicia ha detenido una operación que buscaba concentrar casi 200 licencias de taxi mediante trece empresas con nombres casi idénticos. Todas ellas compartían un mismo administrador, Manuel Alba Fernández, y estaban domiciliadas en la misma dirección. Cada empresa solicitaba 15 licencias, siguiendo un patrón ya conocido en el sector de transporte, que busca rodear la normativa mediante sociedades instrumentales y aparentes independencias. El Juzgado de lo Contencioso-Administrativo número 31 respaldó al Ayuntamiento de Madrid, afirmando que las empresas no habían seguido el procedimiento legal correcto y que el taxi es un servicio público, no un mercado libre sin reglas. Aunque la sentencia aún puede ser recurrida, marca un precedente importante para limitar la concentración de licencias y proteger el equilibrio del sector. Este caso pone de relieve la tensión entre la protección del servicio público y los intereses empresariales, subrayando la necesidad de reglas claras]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Documentos revelan que Trump voló varias veces en el avión privado de Jeffrey Epstein durante los años 90]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Departamento de Justicia de EE.

Según estos registros, Trump voló al menos ocho veces en el avión privado de Epstein entre 1993 y 1996, en algunos casos acompañado de su familia y, en uno, de una joven cuyo nombre aparece censurado. Además, los documentos contienen información recopilada por el FBI sobre la participación de Trump en fiestas celebradas en propiedades de Epstein a principios de la década de 2000. Aunque algunos de estos detalles eran conocidos previamente, esta publicación permite ver por primera vez la extensión de los viajes en el marco de la investigación judicial contra Ghislaine Maxwell, condenada a 20 años de prisión por colaborar en los abusos de Epstein.

Según un informe de Zonaprop, el incremento promedio fue del 19,46%, mientras que la subida interanual alcanza el 35,08%. Actualmente, el precio mensual promedio de un departamento de dos ambientes es de 850 dólares. El 42% de los anuncios de alquiler se publica en dólares, mientras que el resto se ofrece en pesos argentinos. Tras la derogación de la Ley de Alquileres en diciembre de 2023, la proporción de avisos en dólares había disminuido, aunque desde agosto de 2025 se observa un repunte. En cuanto a los barrios más costosos, Puerto Madero lidera la lista con 1.312 dólares mensuales, seguido de Colegiales (1.160 dólares) y Monserrat (1.057 dólares). Por el contrario, Balvanera registra los alquileres más bajos, con un promedio de 700 dólares, seguida de San Nicolás (709 dólares) y Caballito (719 dólares).

La investigación judicial comenzó a tomar forma en 2020, aunque los hechos más controvertidos ocurrieron entre 2008 y 2014, periodo protegido por la inviolabilidad de la corona y, además, por la prescripción de posibles delitos. Fondos millonarios procedentes de Arabia Saudí y Bahréin fueron gestionados mediante fundaciones y cuentas en Suiza y Panamá, llegando incluso a transferencias a personas cercanas al monarca. La Fiscalía y Hacienda reconocieron que los pagos realizados posteriormente por Juan Carlos a la Agencia Tributaria, sumando varios millones de euros, impidieron acusaciones por fraude fiscal. Además, la protección legal y constitucional del cargo evitó que se pudiera presentar juicio alguno por actos durante su reinado.

Sin embargo, este buen desempeño macroeconómico no se refleja en la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos. Los salarios, aunque han experimentado incrementos medios del 3,5% en algunos convenios, siguen siendo insuficientes para cubrir los costes crecientes de vivienda, alimentación y energía. El salario mínimo interprofesional ha subido a 1.184 euros mensuales, pero incluso esta cifra resulta insuficiente en las grandes ciudades. La vivienda es uno de los principales factores de presión económica, con alquileres que superan los 14 euros por metro cuadrado y subidas de precios que pueden absorber gran parte del salario. La cesta de la compra y los suministros energéticos también han experimentado aumentos significativos, afectando especialmente a las rentas bajas, que destinan más del 20% de sus ingresos a estos gastos.

Tras liderar a su partido a la victoria en las elecciones de febrero de 2025, la CDU quedó lejos de la mayoría absoluta, obligando a formar una Gran Coalición con los socialdemócratas del SPD. Aunque Merz prometió mejorar la economía y fortalecer la posición internacional de Alemania, su gestión ha sido percibida como insuficiente. Internamente, enfrenta desafíos por el descontento de miembros de su propio partido, y ministros como Boris Pistorius y Johann Wadephul gozan de mayor aprobación que el propio canciller.

Béjar cuestiona que la nuclear contribuya a la independencia energética de España, dado que el país no produce uranio y depende de suministros de países como Rusia. Además, critica la falta de debate sobre la gestión de residuos nucleares y considera injustificado el apoyo económico que reciben las centrales frente a las renovables, cuyos precios pueden caer cerca de cero. El empresario subraya que uno de los principales problemas del sistema eléctrico es la saturación de la red, que en 2024 denegó 33 GW de solicitudes de conexión y saturó el 83% de los nudos de conexión.

Nacida en 1876 en una familia acomodada, estudió historia en Oxford y, tras la muerte de su hermano, dedicó su vida a ayudar a los más necesitados. Su trabajo en los Balcanes y con la Charity Organisation Society le permitió constatar que la pobreza se debía más a la injusticia que a la desgracia. Tras la guerra, ella y su hermana Dorothy documentaron la hambruna en Europa y fundaron el Consejo de Lucha contra la Hambruna.

Feijóo remitió a la jueza del Juzgado de Instrucción número 3 de Catarroja los mensajes de Mazón, pero no los suyos propios. En dichos mensajes, Mazón reconocía la gravedad de la situación, pero Feijóo asegura que comenzó las conversaciones enviando solidaridad y ofreciendo ayuda tras conocer por los medios el agravamiento de la situación. Según Ibáñez, Feijóo debería dimitir por mentir, ya que Mazón nunca le informó en tiempo real y habría actuado para aparentar control y ocultar la gestión de su equipo territorial.

Estos ataques se justifican por acusaciones a Hamás de no respetar el alto el fuego vigente. La ofensiva ha afectado especialmente al sur de Ciudad de Gaza y al este de Jan Yunis, coincidiendo con la primera Navidad tras dos años de conflicto en la zona. Además, Israel ha bombardeado distintos puntos de la frontera con el Líbano, donde han fallecido dos personas, entre ellas un miembro de la unidad de élite de la Guardia Revolucionaria de Irán. Según el Ejército israelí, los objetivos eran considerados terroristas, específicamente Husein Mahmud Marshad al Juhari, vinculado a la Unidad 840 de la Fuerza Quds, implicada en ataques planificados contra Israel desde Siria y Líbano.

Este hallazgo materializa la presencia de la comicidad en la vida pública y el entretenimiento de la antigua Roma, sugiriendo que el humor corporal podía ser parte de representaciones teatrales y rutinas humorísticas, tal como ocurría en festividades y espectáculos populares. La pieza escultórica ofrece una ventana a las prácticas culturales romanas relacionadas con el teatro, la pantomima y la expresión cómica, destacando cómo los romanos podían integrar lo grotesco y lo humorístico en su arte y en su percepción del cuerpo humano. Más allá de la anécdota, el objeto ayuda a entender las dinámicas entre actores, público y la economía del entretenimiento en una sociedad donde el teatro era una parte integrada de la vida cívica y social.

Estudios muestran que un adulto revisa el teléfono entre 80 y 150 veces al día, generando una sensación constante de urgencia que afecta la comunicación cara a cara. La exposición de los menores a los dispositivos está condicionada por el comportamiento de los adultos: si durante la comida o el ocio familiar todos miran el móvil, los niños perciben que el dispositivo es más importante que las personas. Además, el uso excesivo del móvil se asocia con ansiedad, insomnio y otros problemas de salud.

Según el autor, Gerardo Tecé, el discurso fue breve y simbólico, más enfocado en la puesta en escena que en contenido concreto, adoptando una estrategia de equidistancia que pretende no posicionarse ni a favor ni en contra de distintos sectores de la sociedad.

Mientras muchos compañeros abandonaban la compañía, él optó por quedarse, formarse y adaptarse a los cambios con el objetivo de seguir siendo útil y competitivo.

El despido se produjo de manera inesperada, dentro de un recorte de plantilla que afectó a unas 200 personas en varios países europeos. Favre sospecha que la causa principal fue su coste salarial, ya que con los años había mejorado sus condiciones, y también la deslocalización de funciones hacia países con mano de obra más barata. Tras comunicar su intención de consultar a un abogado, la empresa le ofreció una indemnización de seis meses y un preaviso de cuatro, aunque un asesor legal co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/despedido-a-los-61-tras-cuatro-decadas-en-la-empresa-las-dificultades-para-recolocarse-antes-de-la-jubilacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/despedido-a-los-61-tras-cuatro-decadas-en-la-empresa-las-dificultades-para-recolocarse-antes-de-la-jubilacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 21:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Soziedad Alkoholika - Feliz Falsedad (Con Letra)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este vídeo muestra la canción 'Feliz Falsedad' de la banda española de metal Soziedad Alkoholika, incluyendo la letra para que los espectadores puedan seguirla mientras escuchan la música.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/soziedad-alkoholika-feliz-falsedad-con-letra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/soziedad-alkoholika-feliz-falsedad-con-letra</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 21:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El alcohol siempre es tóxico y puede generar adicción, incluso en cantidades pequeñas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La entrevista con el doctor Gabriel Rubio, referente en adicciones en España, subraya que no existe dosis segura de alcohol y que incluso cantidades mínimas pueden dañar el cerebro y favorecer conductas adictivas. Rubio destaca que la adicción al alcohol es una enfermedad crónica con predisposición a recaídas, y que la vulnerabilidad persiste incluso tras la abstinencia. Se enfatiza que la diferencia de género existe: las mujeres pueden sufrir daños neurológicos con menores consumos por la mayor sensibilidad de sus neuronas a tóxicos. El artículo concluye que el tratamiento efectivo requiere un enfoque integral que combine desintoxicación, terapia cognitivo-conductual y, crucialmente, apoyo comunitario y grupos de ayuda mutua. El Hospital 12 de Octubre de Madrid ha desarrollado un programa pionero que aborda recuperación conductual, emocional y de valores, y que ha demostrado mayor sostenibilidad de abstinencia al incluir estas redes de apoyo.

Desde el 11 de diciembre, aproximadamente 14 embarcaciones han transportado petróleo, seis de ellas bajo sanciones, según Kpler. Algunas han desactivado sus señales automáticas de posición, una práctica que indica evasión de controles. La administración Trump ha intensificado su presencia naval y ha abordado buques sancionados y no sancionados, como el petrolero Centuries, con el objetivo de limitar los ingresos del régimen de Maduro. Sin embargo, la producción y exportación de Venezuela apenas se ha visto afectada, manteniéndose cerca de 890.000 barriles diarios frente a los 800.000 habituales, y la mayoría del crudo se dirige a China.

A pesar de que el conflicto y la violencia contra la población palestina continúan, la cobertura informativa ha desaparecido en gran medida de portadas, informativos y redes sociales. El artículo parte de la reflexión de periodistas palestinos como Ola Al Azanoun y Motaz Azaira, quienes denuncian que el mundo ha pasado página mientras el genocidio sigue sin resolverse.

El texto se centra especialmente en la viñeta de prensa y la ilustración como herramientas históricas de denuncia y movilización social. Durante los primeros meses de la guerra, caricaturas y dibujos ocuparon un lugar destacado en medios y revistas satíricas, sirviendo como altavoz de la destrucción de Palestina, la responsabilidad directa del Gobierno israelí y la complicidad de Estados Unidos.

En sus publicaciones, Trump criticó duramente a diversas cadenas y presentadores, incluyendo a Stephen Colbert y la CBS, calificándolos de carentes de talento y con bajos índices de audiencia. Asimismo, cuestionó la calidad de los programas nocturnos de ABC, NBC y CBS, señalando que todos comparten salarios elevados, falta de talento y escasa audiencia. Este enfrentamiento se suma a otros incidentes, como los desencuentros anteriores con presentadores como Jimmy Kimmel.

Durante este periodo, la mujer dejó de pagar 212.461,12 euros, cantidad que también deberá abonar. La sentencia descarta íntegramente el recurso presentado contra la resolución previa del Tribunal Económico-Administrativo y considera probada la residencia habitual de la mujer en Gijón. Los indicios que fundamentan esta decisión incluyen movimientos bancarios realizados en entidades asturianas, el consumo energético y telefónico superior en su domicilio de Gijón frente al de Madrid, así como el uso continuado de la sanidad asturiana, tanto pública como privada.

Estas imágenes, que se encontraban en carretes dentro de maletas trasladadas de Madrid a Barcelona, muestran la vida cotidiana de la retaguardia republicana, incluyendo escenas familiares, del pueblo de Chiva, playas y mercados, alejadas del dramatismo bélico. Lodeiro, mecánico y militante de la CNT, fue fusilado en 1940 tras un proceso sumarísimo, pocas horas después de casarse por poderes con Julia, dejando cartas llenas de afecto para su esposa e hija. La publicación de estas fotografías en el libro bilingüe 'Estiu del 37' permite rescatar no solo la memoria visual de aquel verano, sino también la historia personal y familiar de los protagonistas.

La medida busca evitar un aumento brusco de costes y una espiral inflacionaria mientras el país desarrolla su propia capacidad de producción mediante la Ley de Chips. Aunque se mantiene la postura firme frente a China en la guerra tecnológica, la suspensión refleja la imposibilidad de un desacople total a corto plazo sin dañar la economía estadounidense. Los fabricantes habían advertido de incrementos de costes de hasta un 25% en sectores críticos, lo que podría repercutir directamente en los precios al consumidor.

Argumentan que Bondi mantiene un conflicto de intereses debido a su relación previa con Ballard Partners, una empresa de 'lobbying' que presta servicios a UnitedHealthcare. Según los abogados, este vínculo podría comprometer la imparcialidad del proceso, especialmente porque Bondi ordenó que se solicitara la pena de muerte contra Mangione.
