Greenwood, along with Phantom Thread director Paul Thomas Anderson, stated that the use of the music in the documentary breached the terms of his agreement as a composer. According to a joint statement obtained by Variety, a piece from the Phantom Thread score was reused without Greenwood being consulted, which his legal representatives argue violates his contract, even though he does not personally own the copyright to the score.

The distributor of Phantom Thread, Universal Pictures, allegedly approved the third-party use without seeking Greenwood’s consent. As a result, Greenwood and Anderson asked that the music be withdrawn from the documentary.

While singing her hit 'Si Te Vas' at Jorge Mágico González Stadium in San Salvador, the 49-year-old singer twisted her right ankle and fell, taking down her microphone stand. Despite the fall, she quickly got up and carried on with the performance, impressing fans with her resilience. Videos captured by attendees went viral on social media, showing both the moment of the fall and the crowd's reactions. Shakira later reassured fans via Instagram Stories, joking that she was 'made of rubber.' This was not the first time Shakira had fallen during a live performance; she had a similar incident in Montreal last year. The El Salvador shows were her first performances in Central America, with tickets selling out quickly. The Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran tour, launched in February 2025 to promote her twelfth studio album, has become one of her most suc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shakira-suffers-fall-during-el-salvador-concert-but-keeps-performing</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shakira-suffers-fall-during-el-salvador-concert-but-keeps-performing</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 15:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Advanced Engineering Shapes Modern Wellness Spaces]]></title><description><![CDATA[Modern wellness centers have undergone a significant transformation, moving away from clinical aesthetics toward spaces that feel like luxury lounges or art galleries. This shift is not just about interior design but is deeply rooted in advancements in hardware engineering. Multi-functional, compact, and silent beauty devices allow treatments such as radio frequency, vacuum therapy, and laser procedures to be consolidated into single units, maintaining minimalist aesthetics without compromising effectiveness. These innovations also make non-invasive, 'lunchtime' procedures safer, quicker, and more precise, appealing to lifestyle-oriented clients. Ergonomic designs with intuitive touchscreens allow equipment to be integrated into open layouts without disrupting visual harmony. Looking forward, AI diagnostics are set to further enhance personalization, analyzing skin conditions in real time and adjusting treatments automatically.

Located in the central United States and spanning primarily Missouri while extending into Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma, the Ozarks are characterized by rolling hills, forests, rivers, waterfalls, and dramatic landscapes. Although often overshadowed by more famous destinations like the Grand Canyon or Hawaii, the region is described as equally deserving of recognition for special occasions.

A major focal point is the Lake of the Ozarks, a man-made lake that blends seamlessly into the natural environment. The lake provides scenic waterfront venues, striking sunsets, and unique celebration options, including lakeside and even floating settings. The reflective sunset views over the water are portrayed as especially romantic and memorable for couples marking significant milestones.

Macron emphasized the importance of organizing these talks carefully, with limited participants, and suggested that initial technical contacts indicate that Russia is currently not seeking peace. He stressed the need to rebuild discussion channels and expressed that the United States should not monopolize the diplomatic process, despite resuming talks with Russia under President Trump. Macron reiterated that when Moscow and Kyiv eventually reach a peace agreement, Europe must establish a new security architecture that includes Russia. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded by affirming Russia's longstanding support for dialogue, noting that recent communications with France could enable high-level, operational discussions. Peskov also welcomed Macron’s statements, stating that reducing relations with Euro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/macron-advocates-for-structured-dialogue-between-europe-and-russia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/macron-advocates-for-structured-dialogue-between-europe-and-russia</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[European Commission Scales Back Plan for New EU Intelligence Unit After Opposition]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on the European Commission’s decision to scale back its initial proposal to create a new EU-level intelligence-gathering unit. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had announced in November the intention to establish an internal intelligence cell under her direct supervision. The stated objective was to better protect the European Union from cyberattacks and acts of sabotage attributed to Russia. However, the proposal met with significant resistance from several European capitals and from within the EU’s diplomatic service, which already operates its own intelligence-sharing structure.

According to Politico, disagreements emerged between von der Leyen and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Kaja Kallas, over the scope and control of the new body. As a result of this opposition, the Commission reduced the scale and ambitions of the project. The revised plan envisions a much smaller unit composed of two EU officials and two diplomats.

Drawing on patterns from January 6, 2021, Kinzinger argues that Trump is using rhetoric and strategic actions to convince his supporters that the electoral system is rigged, regardless of actual outcomes. The piece details Trump's proposals to 'nationalize' elections in key states, and his insistence on strict proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters, which could disenfranchise millions. It also highlights Trump's history of baseless claims of voter fraud, including the 2016 and 2020 elections, and his efforts to amplify doubts through allies like Steve Bannon, who have suggested extreme measures such as deploying ICE agents at polling sites. The article emphasizes that Trump’s goal is less about actual legislative change and more about shaping public perception of the election process, increasing suspicion and ten]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-efforts-to-undermine-trust-in-the-electoral-system</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-efforts-to-undermine-trust-in-the-electoral-system</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 07:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UAE Businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem Appears in Unredacted Epstein Files, Details of Email Shared by Lawmakers]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie revealed that Emirati businessman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, chairman and CEO of DP World, is the recipient mentioned in a 2009 email from Jeffrey Epstein referencing a 'torture video'. The email, part of the Department of Justice’s released Epstein files, had previously redacted the recipient’s name. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed the identification of Sulayem in the document EFTA00666117, although the email address remains redacted. The content of the 'torture video' remains unknown. Reports indicate that Sulayem maintained a personal relationship with Epstein, including correspondence about sexual matters, even after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting an underage prostitute. Massie, who advocated for full transparency of the Epstein files, highlighted the email chain on social media, prompting Blanche to emphasize that the documents require certain redactions for privacy reasons.

According to the author, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent send contradictory signals by publicly endorsing a strong dollar while simultaneously pursuing policies that deliberately weaken it. This strategy has contributed to heightened volatility in global markets, rising gold prices, capital flows into perceived safe havens such as the Swiss franc, and growing unease among international investors.

The weakening of the dollar has far-reaching consequences. Many global assets, including sovereign debt of poorer countries and key commodities such as oil and pharmaceuticals, are priced in U.S. dollars. A falling dollar reduces debt burdens for borrowers but imposes losses on creditors, while also raising import prices for U.S. consumers and potentially ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dollar-volatility-u-s-policy-and-mark-carney-s-proposal-for-a-new-global-reserve-currency</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dollar-volatility-u-s-policy-and-mark-carney-s-proposal-for-a-new-global-reserve-currency</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 04:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Signs Multi-Billion Dollar Investment Agreements to Rebuild Syria]]></title><description><![CDATA[On February 10, 2026, Syria and Saudi Arabia signed multiple strategic agreements aimed at modernizing Syria's infrastructure and boosting economic recovery. These agreements include the establishment of a joint low-cost airline called 'Nas Syria,' in partnership with Saudi carrier Flynas, which will begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. The airline will be 51% Syrian-owned and 49% Saudi-owned. Another major project, SilkLink, will invest approximately $1 billion to improve Syria's telecommunications network and digital connectivity. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will invest $2 billion in modernizing Aleppo's existing airport and constructing a new one, alongside funding initiatives for seawater desalination and real estate projects in historic Syrian cities. These investments follow the lifting of the US Caesar Act sanctions in December 2025, providing an economic opportunity for the war-torn country, which has seen its GDP drop 54% between 2010 and 2021.

Hosted by Caroline Yoder, the episode breaks down the card’s benefits, potential drawbacks, and ideal use cases in a clear and practical way, aimed at listeners who are considering applying for the card.

The discussion is structured around three main scenarios. First, the hosts consider whether the card makes sense for someone planning a single upcoming Disney vacation. In this case, the analysis focuses on short-term perks such as welcome bonuses, Disney-related discounts, and any immediate savings that could offset the card’s annual fee. Next, the podcast explores the card’s long-term value for regular Disney visitors who primarily spend money on Disney parks, hotels, and merchandise.

Collaborating with designers Marc Newson and Jony Ive from LoveFrom, Ferrari focused on craftsmanship and tactile interaction rather than relying heavily on digital screens. The interior emphasizes high-quality materials, metal finishes, and real switches, creating a sense of presence and sophistication. Displays are integrated subtly, avoiding visual clutter, while controls are designed as objects that invite interaction. Notably, the shifter is a single piece of glass, developed with Corning's Fusion 5 and precision laser drilling to allow hidden illumination, reflecting the meticulous attention to detail. This approach prioritizes simplicity, elegance, and a stronger connection between driver and machine. The exterior design aligns with Ferrari's latest design language for a four-door EV, though technical specifications are still limited.

The piece in question, 'Barbara Rose', was used in the documentary directed by Brett Ratner without Greenwood's consultation. Although Greenwood does not own the copyright to the score, his legal representatives argue that the film's distributor, Universal, violated his composer agreement by allowing a third-party use of the music without approval. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second inauguration, has generated $13.35 million domestically, surpassing initial box office expectations despite criticism. Reviewers, including The Independent’s Nick Hilton, have described the documentary as more staged entertainment than factual portrayal.

Under the new system, all accounts will default to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless users verify that they are adults. This means unverified users will be restricted from accessing age-restricted servers and channels, speaking in Stage channels, or viewing content flagged as graphic or sensitive. Additional safety measures include warnings for friend requests from unfamiliar users and filtering direct messages from unknown contacts into a separate inbox.

Existing age-restricted servers will become inaccessible until users complete age verification, even if they were previously members. These servers will appear as obfuscated black screens until verification is complete, and users will also be prevented from joining new age-restricted servers without confirming their age.

Through April 22, 2026, eligible cardholders can earn extra Hyatt points on DoorDash purchases, with enhanced rewards for restaurant orders and a one-time discount opportunity tied to Hyatt hotel stays.

Under the promotion, World of Hyatt cardholders earn a total of 3 Hyatt points per dollar on DoorDash restaurant orders. This total is achieved by stacking the card’s standard 2 points per dollar on dining purchases with an additional 1 bonus point per dollar offered during the promotional period. For non-restaurant DoorDash orders, cardholders earn 2 points per dollar, combining the card’s usual 1 point per dollar with the same 1-point bonus. No registration is required, but purchases must be made directly through DoorDash using the World of Hyatt credit card, not via digital wallets such as Apple Pay or Google Pay.

Many cardholders reported declined transactions and subsequently frozen accounts, causing delays in earning the advertised 5x points on purchases. Verification processes for unlocking accounts required sending a photo with a government ID via email, a method considered insecure and inefficient. Additional problems arose with the 5x rewards offer, particularly for users who applied through The Points Guy (TPG) affiliate link within the first 24 hours. Some were not seeing the 5x points attached to their accounts due to miscommunication with Bilt’s AI chatbot or delays in processing, despite Bilt confirming eligibility via email in some cases.

The initiative seeks to leverage Ukraine's defense industry growth, particularly in drones battle-tested against Russian forces, to enable partners to acquire advanced, proven technologies. Production of Ukrainian drones is scheduled to commence in Germany by mid-February 2026, with Zelenskyy noting he will receive the first unit produced there on a fully operational line. Similar projects already exist in the UK, relying entirely on Ukrainian tech and expertise. With approximately 800 arms producers in Ukraine and over 4 million drones manufactured annually, the sector has become the country's largest industry by wartime financial inflows.

Guests who book a minimum of four nights before May 10, 2026, and complete their stay by June 10, 2027, will receive a $2,510 rebate per cabana. This offer applies even to award stays booked with Hilton Honors points or free night certificates. The payment is sent via wire transfer within 28 days after providing complete payment information following check-out. Standard booking and cancellation policies still apply. Although the property typically requires significant Hilton points — around 960,000 points for a four-night stay — the rebate can reduce the effective cost, making it an attractive option for travelers already planning a stay.

Released on December 8, 2025, the video uses satire to explain the rationale, implications, and controversies surrounding the policy in a way that is both accessible and informative.

According to the article, the ad stands out because it closely mirrors the government’s own messaging while stripping away political spin. It outlines official concerns such as the impact of social media on young people’s mental health, exposure to harmful content, online bullying, and data privacy risks. At the same time, the video highlights unresolved questions about how such a ban would be enforced, what role social media companies would play, and whether age-verification systems could create new privacy or surveillance issues.

Beginning with the work of French geologist Jacques de Morgan in 1892, it highlights how British capitalist William Knox D'Arcy secured exclusive oil rights from the Shah of Persia in 1901. Through complex negotiations, investments, and espionage involving figures like Sidney Reilly, D'Arcy's concession was eventually shared with Burmah Oil, forming the Anglo Persian Oil Company, now known as BP. The discovery of the Abadan oil field in 1908 and the subsequent construction of the world's largest refinery by 1912 cemented Persia's strategic significance. Winston Churchill later intervened to ensure British naval superiority by transitioning the Royal Navy from coal to fuel oil, asserting that petroleum was essential for military and economic power.

Culleton has lived in the United States for over 20 years, is married to a US citizen, and runs a plastering business in the Boston area. His work permit was issued as part of an ongoing green card application based on his marriage, which he initiated in April 2025 and for which only a final interview remains.

Culleton was arrested during what his lawyer describes as a random immigration sweep while driving home from work. After initially being held in overcrowded cells and reveals a sequence of transfers between detention facilities in New York and Texas, he has spent nearly five months in an ICE detention centre in El Paso. He describes the conditions as harsh and degrading, citing overcrowding, inadequate food, unsanitary toilets, limited outdoor acc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/irish-man-with-valid-us-work-permit-detained-by-ice-for-months-amid-legal-and-procedural-disputes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/irish-man-with-valid-us-work-permit-detained-by-ice-for-months-amid-legal-and-procedural-disputes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 23:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jonny Greenwood and Paul Thomas Anderson seek removal of Phantom Thread score from Melania Trump documentary]]></title><description><![CDATA[Radiohead guitarist and composer Jonny Greenwood, along with filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson, has formally requested the removal of music from their 2017 film Phantom Thread from a controversial documentary about Melania Trump. According to a joint statement issued by their representatives and reported by Variety, a piece of Greenwood’s score was used without proper consultation, which they argue constitutes a breach of the composer’s agreement.

Although Greenwood does not personally own the copyright to the Phantom Thread score, his legal team maintains that Universal, the film’s distributor, failed to consult him before authorising its use in a third-party project. As a result, Greenwood and Anderson have asked for the music to be removed from the documentary, which was directed by Brett Ratner and distributed by Amazon MGM Studios. Both Amazon MGM and Universal have been contacted for comment by The Independent.

The author contends that groundwater depletion, extreme heat, and declining agricultural viability—particularly in northern breadbasket regions—constitute a structural crisis that undermines long-term national sustainability. Drawing on groundwater data and heat stress research, the piece claims that India’s demographic advantage is rapidly becoming a liability as climate thresholds for human labor are exceeded.

Against this backdrop, India’s foreign policy is framed as a short-term asset liquidation strategy rather than a coherent civilizational project. The article describes India as a key intermediary in global energy markets, refining discounted Russian crude for export and later pivoting toward Venezuelan heavy oil under U.S. geopolitical pressure.

Musk made the statement on X in response to commentary surrounding a public service announcement released on Super Bowl Sunday by several women who say they were abused by Epstein. In the video, the women urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to stand with Epstein’s victims and called for the truth to be fully revealed, emphasizing solidarity after years of silence.

The discussion gained traction after conservative commentator Matt Walsh shared the PSA and questioned why the women had not publicly named individuals they allege were involved in Epstein’s crimes. Walsh argued that if the women knew the identities of powerful abusers, they could disclose those names through members of Congress, who would be legally protected when speaking on the House or Senate floor.

It argues that the PSOE, which had little presence inside Spain in the early 1970s, was effectively refounded at the 1974 Congress of Suresnes with decisive support from foreign intelligence services and European social democracy, particularly the CIA and the German Social Democratic Party.

According to the text, the rise of Felipe González as secretary general was not merely an internal party process but part of a broader strategy to prevent a revolutionary outcome after Franco’s death and to marginalize the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), which had borne the brunt of anti-Franco resistance.

Early in the morning, people gather outside distribution centers to receive essential food supplies as wages fail to cover basic living costs. Families that once managed on two incomes now struggle to pay rent and buy food, with inflation steadily eroding purchasing power. According to Capital Area Food Bank, over one-third of households in the region experienced hunger last year, including some with annual incomes of $90,000 to $120,000. Individuals like Shirleyann Desormeaux, a mother of four, and Salih Taylor, a government worker, are forced to rely on food banks despite having jobs. The rise in food insecurity is exacerbated by reduced government assistance, fewer food stamps, and cuts in subsidies for local organizations. As a result, both longtime residents and asylum seekers are increasingly seeking support from charities and church-run food distributions.

Since May, the DOJ has pursued these records from nearly every state, prompting widespread resistance. More than 20 states have refused and have been sued by the federal government, while at least 10 states—representing over 37 million registered voters—have complied, sometimes under so-called “confidential memoranda of understanding.”

According to the Brennan Center, these agreements reveal unprecedented federal ambitions to intervene directly in state-run election administration. The DOJ proposes to analyze state voter rolls itself and instruct states to remove specific voters within 45 days.

The complaint claims that Lil Tjay spat at a Madison Square Garden employee and that a physical confrontation ensued, resulting in severe cervical and lumbar spine injuries to the officer, including disc damage at the L4–L5 level.

With life moving at a fast pace, thoughtful freezer design is shown to contribute to calmer routines and more efficient kitchens.

Rather than simply keeping food frozen, today’s freezers enable families to cook in bulk, store seasonal produce, and preserve leftovers with ease. The article highlights how intuitive layouts, smooth-gliding drawers, and clearly defined compartments make daily interactions simpler and less stressful. These seemingly small design improvements reduce time spent searching for food and encourage better storage habits, which ultimately lead to a more organised home environment.

Pond lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes. Strategically placed lights improve safety by highlighting pond edges and pathways, reducing the risk of accidents, and enhancing security by deterring intruders. Various lighting options are available: submersible lights offer an ethereal glow beneath the water, floating lights provide easy installation and can be solar-powered, while spotlights and uplights draw attention to specific features like waterfalls, fountains, or statues. Fibre optic lighting mimics starlight effects without electricity entering the water, and path lights illuminate walkways while contributing ambient light to the pond area.

Speaking on Czech television channel TN.cz, Babiš stated that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in April 2022 were close to producing a peace agreement before they were abruptly derailed. According to him, the turning point came after a visit to Ukraine by then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom Babiš directly blamed for disrupting the negotiation process.

Babiš argued that the failure to conclude talks at that time eliminated the possibility of a rapid end to the conflict and prolonged the war.

The author traces the emergence of this system from early Rome through the Middle and Late Republic, noting that prior to the 4th century B.C., Roman military equipment and tactics were heavily influenced by Greek and Italic practices. Archaeological and literary evidence suggests that key transitions—such as the adoption of the scutum, Montefortino helmets, La Tène-style swords, and the pilum—coincided with Rome's post-Gallic sack military reforms, centralizing the army and expanding recruitment. The pilum is highlighted as a particularly unusual weapon, heavier than standard javelins and designed with a long iron shank to penetrate shields and armor. Unlike lighter javelins, the pilum could maintain its momentum to potentially harm multiple ranks of enemy soldiers, and the bending of the shan]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX Delays Mars Missions and Reorients Starship Program Toward the Moon]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes a major strategic shift by SpaceX following recent statements by Elon Musk confirming that Starship missions to Mars will not take place for at least five to seven years, effectively delaying any serious Martian effort until the early 2030s. This represents a dramatic departure from Musk’s long-standing narrative, in which Mars colonization was portrayed as an imminent and overriding priority. Instead, SpaceX will now focus its Starship program primarily on the Moon, aligning more closely with NASA’s Artemis program and U.S. geopolitical objectives in cislunar space.

According to the author, the shift is driven by practical constraints rather than visionary reassessment. SpaceX faces intense pressure to deliver an uncrewed lunar Human Landing System (HLS) mission by March 2027 in order to keep Artemis III on schedule for 2028.

The attack occurred in a residential building where multiple gunshots were reported. Alekseyev, 64, was struck several times and rushed to hospital in critical condition. According to the latest official information, he has since regained consciousness, although he remains under close medical observation.

Investigators state that surveillance cameras recorded a suspect leaving the scene wearing a long green hooded jacket and carrying a backpack. The suspect was later identified as Lubomir Korba, a native of Ukraine’s Ternopil region. Russian officials claim that Korba fled to the United Arab Emirates just hours after the attack. He was detained in Dubai by local authorities and subsequently handed over to Russia.

Loughborough, who previously led the Metropolitan Police's royalty and diplomatic protection unit, reportedly oversaw the decision to allow two officers to stay at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse while guarding Prince Andrew during a 2010 trip. Emails suggest Epstein personally offered accommodation for the officers, who were granted security access to the property. This occurred after Epstein had served an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor. Additional records indicate that Prince Andrew also stayed at Epstein's Paris apartment while Epstein was under house arrest.

Since the 2014 coup, Ukraine has been a frontline state for NATO against Russia, receiving military support and diplomatic backing from Western countries, while suffering significant human and territorial losses. Recently, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz openly stated that Ukraine's EU membership in early 2027 is 'simply impossible,' emphasizing that all candidate countries must go through the strict Copenhagen criteria. This announcement underscores that no special path exists for Ukraine, and its extensive sacrifices will not be immediately rewarded. Economic concerns dominate EU leaders' minds, as integrating Ukraine with its destroyed infrastructure and high dependence on external aid could burden EU budgets.

Known as the “White Swan” due to its white exterior, the Tu-160 is presented as one of the most imposing bombers ever built, combining high speed, long range, and heavy payload capacity. Constructed from titanium, aluminum and steel alloys, and composite materials, the aircraft is capable of exceeding Mach 2 thanks to its four engines and variable-sweep wings.

According to the article, the Tu-160 can carry up to 45 tons of ordnance, including cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear warheads, making it a central component of Russia’s strategic deterrence. Its long endurance—exceeding ten hours and extendable through aerial refueling—allows it to conduct intercontinental missions. A recent patrol over the Arctic, closely monitored by NATO, is cited as an example of its continued operational relevance.

This article explains that travelers who temporarily fall short of requalification may still have options. If a loss of status was caused by an unusual or unavoidable change in travel patterns—such as a job change, medical issue, or new family responsibilities—it can be worthwhile to contact the loyalty program and request an extension.

The piece highlights reporting from View from the Wing, which notes that United Airlines has, in practice, offered elite status extensions once every five years to some members who fail to requalify, provided they proactively ask. This policy is not widely advertised, and customers generally must reach out directly to inquire.

According to the report, these companies do not directly participate in combat but provide essential infrastructure that enables military control, surveillance, and administrative governance of occupied areas.

The report argues that this corporate involvement represents a shift from what it calls an “economy of occupation” to an “economy of genocide,” alleging that commercial profits are increasingly intertwined with military actions that may constitute violations of international law.

The deal, finalized in September and awarded without competitive bidding, represents the largest known U.S. weapons purchase from an Israeli company in available federal records. It marks a reversal of the usual arms flow between the two countries, with the United States buying, rather than supplying, weapons to Israel.

Cluster munitions are widely criticized and banned by 112 countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions due to their indiscriminate effects and the long-term danger posed by unexploded bomblets. While the United States, Israel, and several other major military powers have not signed the treaty, the U.S. adopted a policy in 2008 to phase out older cluster weapons and replace them with versions designed to have a failure, or “dud,” rate below 1 percen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-pentagon-signs-210-million-no-bid-deal-with-israeli-firm-for-new-cluster-munitions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-pentagon-signs-210-million-no-bid-deal-with-israeli-firm-for-new-cluster-munitions</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukrainian Divers Target Oil Tanker Near Senegal's Coast in Sophisticated Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[On November 27, 2025, four Ukrainian divers carried out a targeted attack on the Mersin oil tanker off the coast of Senegal. The tanker, which was anchored 19 kilometers from the Senegalese coast, was hit by underwater explosives, damaging its hull and causing water to flood its engine room. The tanker, owned by the Turkish Besiktas Shipping company, was flying the Panamanian flag but was part of Russia’s ‘phantom fleet.’ It had left Taman Port in Russia in August. The attack led to an extensive operation to prevent an oil spill, including deploying Senegal's ‘Plan Polmar,’ involving tugboats and rescue ships. The 22 crew members, mostly Turkish nationals, were evacuated. The explosions, which were attributed to Ukrainian intelligence by sources close to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, involved Soviet-era limpet mines, and the attack marks the first of its kind in the Atlantic.

Proposed by Chris Williamson, the concept envisions a high-speed rail network that forms a continuous circle, linking cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin, and Bangor. Unlike traditional rail networks, which have fixed endpoints, The Loop offers a more fluid, circular connection, allowing cities to interact more like interconnected neighborhoods. This continuous, rhythmical system offers more than just practicality; it carries an emotional resonance, representing movement and relationship rather than a linear journey from point A to point B. This conceptual framework imagines a shared, ever-moving network where people, ideas, and cultures flow more freely. The idea reflects a deeper vision of mobility, one that emphasizes connection and circulation, inviting a rethinking of how cities can be linked not just ph]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-concept-for-a-circular-rail-network-linking-major-northern-cities</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-concept-for-a-circular-rail-network-linking-major-northern-cities</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin Focus on Lunar Missions Ahead of Artemis III]]></title><description><![CDATA[NASA's new interim administrator, Jared Isaacman, has emphasized prioritizing lunar landings over other space projects, aiming to maintain U.S. leadership in lunar exploration.

SpaceX faced setbacks with Starship in 2025, but Elon Musk has announced a temporary pause on Mars plans to focus on the Moon, with a non-crewed HLS test scheduled for March 2027. Meanwhile, Blue Origin is accelerating its lunar efforts with the development of the Blue Moon Mark 1.5 lander, designed for direct lunar missions without orbital refueling, potentially serving as a backup for Artemis IV if HLS is not ready.

It aims to show how scientists work in the cosmetic field, emphasizing that product development is grounded in evidence, safety, and rigorous validation rather than marketing alone.

The development of a new cosmetic begins with identifying a clear objective: defining the skin concern to address, the target consumer, and the expected benefits. Ideas may arise from market trends, unmet consumer needs, scientific evidence, or innovation in new ingredients developed through basic research.

The text discusses how the 2011 15M movement and the emergence of parties like Ciudadanos, VOX, and Podemos reflected the need for political renewal. Recent regional elections demonstrate a resurgence of local parties, such as Bloque Nacionalista Galego, Chunta Aragonesista, Por Ávila, and ¡Soria Ya!, challenging the traditional dominance of PSOE and PP.

Initially, the designs were to feature Toussaint Louverture, a Haitian revolutionary leader, inspired by artist Édouard Duval-Carrié. However, the International Olympic Committee prohibited political imagery, prompting a redesign that emphasized a symbolic red horse instead. These uniforms go beyond athletic apparel, serving as a moving canvas of identity and resilience.

While the Iranian government bears primary responsibility for suppressing dissent, criminalizing reform, and mismanaging the economy, the author contends that Western policies—especially those of the United States—have deliberately undermined the social forces most capable of producing peaceful change.

For more than two decades, many Iranians sought gradual reform through elections, civic mobilization, and support for reformist leaders. This strategy depended heavily on economic stability and the growth of a confident middle class, historically the engine of social and political change in Iran.

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it has long been the subject of speculation and conspiracy theories.

Despite its isolation, the island bears traces of intense human activity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Seal hunters nearly exterminated local seal populations in the early 1800s, followed decades later by large-scale whaling operations that left behind industrial structures.

The missile is operational and can reach speeds of up to 8 Mach within the atmosphere, equivalent to 10,000 kilometers per hour, and potentially 16 Mach outside the atmosphere. These extreme speeds would allow the missile to reach targets in Israel in approximately 12 minutes. It has a maximum range of 2,000 kilometers and can carry a warhead exceeding one ton, specifically 1,500 kilograms of explosives. Analysts suggest that the missile's high velocity could help it evade existing missile defense systems. This announcement comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington, with Israel indirectly involved, even as diplomatic negotiations with the United States continue. The unveiling of the Jorramshar 4 reflects Iran’s ongoing efforts to advance its military capabilities and demonstrates the strategic importance it places on missile technology in the region.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-announces-new-high-speed-ballistic-missile-capable-of-reaching-israel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-announces-new-high-speed-ballistic-missile-capable-of-reaching-israel</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Political Backlash Erupts After U.S. Olympians Speak Out on Immigration Policies]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a political controversy that unfolded during the opening days of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, as several U.S. athletes publicly expressed discomfort with representing the United States amid ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Freestyle skier Hunter Hess said that wearing the U.S. flag brought 'mixed emotions,' clarifying that representing the country did not mean endorsing all government actions. Figure skater Amber Glenn echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that politics affects everyone and should not be ignored.

These comments sparked an intense backlash from prominent figures within the MAGA movement and conservative media. Commentators and influencers including Megyn Kelly, Jack Posobiec, Marc Thiessen, and Jake Paul accused the athletes of being unpatriotic, with some openly stating they were rooting against Team USA. Social media posts labeled the athletes as 'traitors,' 'snowflakes,' and 'woke beta males,' and argued tha]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/political-backlash-erupts-after-u-s-olympians-speak-out-on-immigration-policies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/political-backlash-erupts-after-u-s-olympians-speak-out-on-immigration-policies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[European Population Grid Map 2021: Age, Gender, Mobility, and Demographic Indicators]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Commission has released a detailed population grid map for 2021, providing comprehensive demographic data across the EU.

The photo was taken during a dinner hosted by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman in Palo Alto, California. Epstein described the gathering as 'wild' in a subsequent email. The dinner also included Peter Thiel and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden. While the event was first reported by Vanity Fair in 2019, the new files, released by the Justice Department on January 30, 2026, have sparked renewed attention. Epstein, who was convicted in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution, maintained relationships with influential figures, despite his criminal past. Musk and Zuckerberg have both publicly downplayed their associations with Epstein, with Musk denying being close to Epstein and Zuckerberg claiming he only met him briefly.

Collectively, the documents indicate that attracting and retaining children and teenagers was a central business objective for these companies, even as internal research acknowledged risks to youth mental health, learning, sleep, and overall well-being.

According to the report, Meta documents describe coordinated strategies to grow teen usage through school-based tactics, ambassador programs, and product features designed to increase habitual engagement.

The presentation highlighted tangible progress that makes the system more usable and relevant than in previous years, particularly in areas where Hurd has historically lagged behind Linux and other modern kernels.

One of the most notable achievements is the near-completion of the x86_64 port. For many years, GNU Hurd was largely limited to 32-bit x86 systems, which severely constrained its practicality on modern hardware. With 64-bit support now essentially complete, Hurd can better target contemporary PCs and servers. In addition, there are early discussions and interest in extending support to AArch64, which would further broaden its hardware reach.

Another critical area of improvement is symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).

Loughlin, 61, is reportedly navigating a separation from her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, after nearly 28 years of marriage. The couple, who share two daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose, had faced legal issues following the 2019 college admissions scandal, which saw Loughlin serve two months in prison and Giannulli five. Sources suggest that the couple's relationship never fully recovered after the legal fallout, and they are now living separate lives with distinct emotional states. During this time, Bure has remained a steadfast friend, staying in touch and offering both private and public support, referring to Loughlin as 'family.'

According to the report, starting on February 10, 2026, eligible cardmembers—including those with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred, Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business, and J.P. Morgan Reserve—will be able to directly buy tickets through a special access link. This offer is notable because it is not a lottery-based system; instead, tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last.

The ticket sales window is expected to run from February 10 through February 24, 2026, though availability may end earlier due to limited inventory. Only Category 1 and Category 2 seats will be offered, which historically have been among the most expensive options.

Amazon saw its valuation drop by $200 billion in a single session, with shares falling more than 9%. Microsoft suffered its largest one-day decline in over five years, losing roughly $357 billion after announcing record AI investments alongside slower growth in its cloud business. Similarly, Alphabet and Nvidia each lost over $100 billion in market capitalization, reflecting concerns about whether the massive AI spending will translate into profits. Despite these setbacks, investments in AI are projected to increase by 50% this year. Analysts warn that while AI has potential, the enormous capital expenditures required for building large data centers and integrating AI into products create significant financial risks.

One voter from New Mexico, identified only as 'John,' called C-SPAN's 'Washington Journal' to apologize for supporting Trump in three consecutive elections. He criticized the president for posting a racist video on Truth Social featuring former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, calling it embarrassing and dishonorable. John also condemned Trump's relationships with corporate leaders, alleged corruption, and harsh immigration enforcement policies, including raids targeting children and schools. Public frustration with Trump extends beyond isolated incidents, reflected in polling showing Americans are unhappy with his authoritarian tendencies, handling of the economy, and focus on conspiracy theories rather than domestic issues.

Since American Airlines awards Loyalty Points for credit card spending, shopping portals, hotel bookings, and other partnerships, travelers close to an elite threshold can finish qualifying from home. The author describes using AAdvantage Shopping and tax payments on credit cards to bridge the gap between Gold and Platinum status, while also clarifying timing rules around February transactions and statement closing dates.

Rather than focusing on travel rewards or credit cards, the piece curates stories that are striking, ironic, or emotionally compelling.

The first story centers on a large-scale fraud involving helicopter rescue operations in Nepal. Because trekking at high altitudes is dangerous, hikers are typically required to have insurance that covers emergency rescues, which are common and extremely costly. According to the article, several travel and rescue executives allegedly exploited this system by submitting fabricated rescue claims. These claims reportedly included fake hospital documents, medical invoices, and cargo manifests. Authorities arrested six executives, with one company accused of filing 171 fraudulent claims out of more than 1,200 submissions, leading to over $10 million in illegitimate insurance payouts.

In a recent episode of her podcast, Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky, she spoke with actress Jameela Jamil about the lingering fear and anxiety stemming from the intense public scrutiny she experienced. Lewinsky explained that although she has made progress in healing and has become more confident in her identity, the fear of losing everything she has built remains a constant presence. She described moments of vulnerability, feeling as though the trauma from the past could resurface at any time and threaten her sense of purpose and stability. Despite these challenges, Lewinsky emphasized her efforts to stay grounded in the present and focus on what she has now rather than what happened decades ago.

While the tariffs have indeed discouraged imports, the article argues that a significant portion of the adjustment in the trade balance, particularly with Europe, is influenced by broader geopolitical events. The post controversially suggests that the war in Ukraine has had economic repercussions that affected trade flows.

The Naasan family exemplifies this crisis: they have been forcibly uprooted twice from their ancestral lands in the Jordan Valley due to violent attacks by Israeli settlers and military forces. Settler raids, home demolitions, and systemic harassment continue to target Palestinian communities, particularly Bedouin villages in Area C, leading to widespread displacement. Since October 2023, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been internally displaced, including over 30,000 from refugee camps during large-scale military operations. The displacement is accompanied by property destruction, killing of livestock, and direct threats to civilians.

The burial pit was found just south of the Iron Age hillfort at Wandlebury and contains the remains of up to ten young men. The site is located in what was once a volatile frontier zone between the Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia, an area frequently contested during the early Viking presence in England.

The grave is striking for the chaotic and violent nature of the burial. It includes at least four complete skeletons that appear to have been bound at the time of burial, with dismembered body parts—such as stacked legs, scattered limbs, and a pile of skulls—thrown on top of them. While only limited evidence of combat injuries has been identified, including a single skull with chop marks consistent with decapitation, the overall arrangement suggests extreme viole]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 06:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Offers Two Free Games This Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epic Games Store continues its tradition of offering free games to its users, doubling the number of free titles compared to the previous week.

Relations between South Africa and Washington have cooled due to political disagreements, South Africa’s positions on sensitive international issues, and its participation in alliances such as BRICS, which challenge U.S. global influence. As a result, the United States has threatened South Africa’s trade privileges and imposed tariffs on key exports, negatively affecting an economy already vulnerable to global instability.

In response, South Africa has accelerated a strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the U.S. market while diversifying its trade partnerships. China has emerged as a central player in this shift. Beijing has decided to grant tariff-free access to specific South African products, offering immediate relief to exporters harmed by U.S. tariffs.

U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns had initially blocked her deportation and recommended that she be issued a student visa to return to the U.S. However, federal prosecutors argue that the Secretary of State does not have the legal authority to grant visas unilaterally. The government further noted that if Lopez Belloza returned, she would still be subject to immediate detention and removal under a final deportation order. ICE confirmed that while they considered returning her to the status quo prior to her removal, they have decided against it.

From the title, the article appears to address renewed scrutiny surrounding the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and how alleged associations, documents, or revelations connected to him may have political consequences in the United Kingdom.

In the apology, printed in The Wall Street Journal, Ye attributed some of his behavior to a 2002 car accident that caused a brain injury and potentially worsened his bipolar disorder, diagnosed in 2016. Despite their divorce in 2022, Kardashian emphasized that they remain committed co-parents to their four children: North, 12, Saint, 10, Chicago, 8, and Psalm, 6. She reaffirmed their family bond, stating, “We’ll always be family,” and expressed her focus on stability and love for their children. Kardashian also praised a pair of Yeezy boots in a TikTok video, noting their style and personal significance. Ye’s apology letter detailed his mental health struggles, including a manic episode that led to destructive actions, and he expressed deep remorse for his past antisemitic behavior, emphasizing accountability and meaningful change.

The one-minute clip, posted on Thursday evening, primarily focused on repeating false claims about alleged irregularities in the 2020 presidential election, particularly questioning President Joe Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania. Near the end of the video, at the 59-second mark, an AI-generated image appeared showing Barack Obama’s face superimposed on a monkey’s body, accompanied by the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The post quickly drew criticism across social media platforms, with many users and public figures denouncing it as racist and offensive. California Governor Gavin Newsom, through his press office, described the post as “disgusting behavior” and urged Republicans to publicly denounce it.

This development comes after months of escalating trade tensions, where U.S. punitive tariffs were imposed to pressure India into aligning its energy policy with American priorities. By agreeing to redirect its energy imports to other countries, particularly the U.S. and Venezuela, India has shifted from its longstanding strategy of diversified energy sourcing and cost prioritization. The move highlights the influence of economic leverage in international relations, signaling that access to major markets often requires political concessions. While India maintains some strategic autonomy, the decision underscores the limits of neutrality when faced with the economic power of a global hegemon. For emerging economies, this case demonstrates that maintaining a neutral position in global energy politics can come with high costs and strategic constrain]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 20:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical Continuity of State-Sanctioned Violence from the KKK to ICE]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article draws a historical parallel between the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), framing both as instruments of state terror designed to divide and control the working class. The KKK emerged after the U.S. Civil War to maintain white supremacy and social order through terror, targeting Black citizens and preventing interracial labor solidarity. The article argues that the KKK’s racial violence was not mere fanaticism but a calculated political tool tolerated or supported by authorities, evolving over time from clandestine operations to infiltrating government structures. ICE, created in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, is portrayed as a modern continuation of this model, enforcing xenophobic and anti-labor policies under legal authority. Through practices such as dawn raids, arbitrary arrests, family separations, and detention centers, ICE creates a climate of fear aimed at disciplining the broader U.S. working class.

Its standout feature is an exceptionally strong welcome offer: 100,000 Atmos points plus a 25,000-point Global Companion Award after $6,000 in spend within 90 days. Given an estimated average value of 1.5 cents per point, the welcome bonus alone can be worth roughly $1,875 if fully optimized.

The card earns 3x points on Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, dining, and foreign purchases, with 1x on all other spending. It also provides a 10% bonus on earned points for cardholders with eligible Bank of America accounts.

Contrary to the simplified narratives often presented in popular culture, the story reveals the complex and uncomfortable realities of power, oppression, and survival in the American South. During the early nineteenth century, several Native American nations of the Southeast, including the Cherokee, adopted aspects of European-American culture in an effort to avoid displacement. This process of so-called “civilization” included plantation agriculture and the enslavement of Black people.

After the forced removal known as the Trail of Tears, wealthy Cherokee elites rebuilt their plantation economy in Indian Territory, bringing enslaved people with them.

Washington has demanded such access since 2022 under what it calls Enhanced Border Security Partnerships (EBSP), linking data-sharing arrangements to continued participation in the US Visa Waiver Program. While most EU countries are affected, Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus are already excluded from visa-free travel, and Denmark and Ireland will not be bound by the EU framework due to legal opt-outs.

It references statements made over 20 years ago by climatologist Mojib Latif, who predicted that Germany would no longer experience harsh winters due to global warming, noting that recent severe winter conditions contradict those predictions. The text criticizes climate models like ERA5 and datasets such as HadCRUT for relying on indirect measurements and statistical estimations rather than actual, continuous temperature recordings. The author argues that temperature databases are adjusted over time, sometimes retroactively, to fit prevailing climate narratives, highlighting past controversies including the 2009 East Anglia emails that suggested manipulation of climate records.

Speaking at a conference at Ottawa’s Rideau Club, Eyre argued that Canada would never achieve true strategic independence without its own nuclear deterrent. He claimed that Canada possesses many of the prerequisites for such a program, including a strong civilian nuclear industry, scientific expertise, and significant uranium reserves, which rank among the largest in the world.

Eyre emphasized that he was not necessarily calling for the immediate development of nuclear weapons, but rather for keeping all strategic options open. He suggested investing in delivery technologies, particularly in aerospace and missile capabilities, so that Canada could act quickly if future circumstances demanded it. According to Eyre, these steps would provide strategic coverage in an increasingly unstable global environment.

This offer was especially valuable, prompting many cardholders to plan significant spending as soon as their cards became active.

However, reports surfaced indicating that the 5x promotion was not properly attached to all accounts that cardholders believed were eligible.

Instead of traditional in-ear earbuds, Slac consists of a circular ear ring paired with a wrist component, both of which resemble contemporary jewelry more than audio devices. The ear ring wraps gently around the ear without entering the ear canal, allowing users to remain aware of conversations, traffic, and environmental sounds while listening to music or other audio content.

A key feature of the design is its modular, case-free approach. When not in use, the ear ring magnetically attaches to the wrist piece, transforming into a bracelet-like form. This eliminates the need for a separate charging or storage case and reinforces the idea that the product is meant to be worn continuously, like jewelry.

Surveillance video logs reviewed by investigators describe an orange-colored figure ascending the staircase to Epstein’s isolated housing tier at approximately 10:39 p.m. the night before his body was discovered. This observation appears to contradict repeated official statements that no one entered the tier that night.

The records show that different investigative bodies interpreted the same blurry video footage in conflicting ways. FBI reviewers suggested the figure could have been an inmate wearing an orange prison uniform, while the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General concluded it was an unidentified corrections officer possibly carrying orange linen or bedding.

The story will explore the consequences of the game’s ending while introducing new protagonists who must navigate a world shaped by the actions of powerful, established characters.

The series is being produced in collaboration with Hasbro Entertainment, with additional executive producers including Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O’Connor, and Hasbro’s Gabriel Marano.

Unlike conventional bridges where roads go over water, this aqueduct allows a road to pass underneath a waterway. Boats can travel smoothly across the shallow channel on top while cars drive below without interruption. This design eliminates the need for drawbridges, tall structures, or any waiting times for passing vessels, creating a seamless flow of both road and water traffic. The structure highlights a minimalist and efficient engineering approach, characteristic of Dutch design thinking, where water is integrated into infrastructure rather than treated as an obstacle.

CEO Mike Stanton warned that allowing Chinese vehicles could be detrimental to the U.S. automotive industry, consumers, and the country’s economic interests. While some members of Congress, such as Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, reportedly support resisting Chinese imports, there is bipartisan acknowledgment of the challenges posed by the direct-to-consumer sales model favored by Chinese manufacturers.

The discussion breaks down key aspects such as earning rates on everyday spending, standard airline perks like free checked bags and priority boarding, and whether those benefits meaningfully offset the annual fee. A significant portion of the episode is dedicated to lounge access policies, elite-status-related perks, and how each card supports travelers who are chasing or maintaining airline status.

At the same time, it acknowledges that alternative explanations exist, with some outlets suggesting the satellite may have broken apart due to an accidental collision with space debris rather than a deliberate military strike.

The Olymp/Luch satellites, launched beginning in 2014, have long drawn attention from Western governments because of what they describe as unusual behavior.

This approach, the article argues, makes a genuine peace agreement impossible and instead serves a political objective: prolonging the conflict while portraying Russia as inherently hostile to peace.

A central argument is that European and US proposals assume from the outset that Russia would violate any future agreement. On that basis, Western actors emphasize the need for so-called security guarantees for Ukraine.

However, critics argue the measure is largely ineffective and poses serious risks to privacy and civil liberties. Social media companies prioritize advertising revenue over user well-being, designing platforms to maximize engagement, often to the detriment of mental health. Measures like hiding 'likes' could reduce harm without restricting access, but governments often avoid these less disruptive alternatives due to economic interests. Prohibiting access entirely can hinder freedom of expression, access to information, and social development, especially for marginalized groups or individuals with dissident sexual and gender identities. Age verification systems, required for enforcement, would create centralized databases linking civil identities to online activity, increasing cybercrime risks and eliminating anonymity that historically protects dissent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-spain-s-social-media-ban-risks-privacy-concerns-and-alternatives</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-spain-s-social-media-ban-risks-privacy-concerns-and-alternatives</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 22:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian General Vladimir Alexeiev Wounded in Moscow Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[On the morning of February 6, 2026, a terrorist attack occurred on the stairs of a residential building near Moscow targeting General Vladimir Alexeiev of the Russian army. The attacker fired multiple shots at Alexeiev's back. He was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery and remains in a coma. Alexeiev, of Ukrainian origin, is the deputy director of Russia's military intelligence agency, GRU, oversees the country's private military companies, and was involved in negotiations during the Wagner Group mutiny in 2023. He is also under U.S. and U.K. sanctions for alleged involvement in election interference and the 2018 Salisbury poisoning incident. The attack coincides with the start of trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi, in which his superior, Igor Kostyukov, is participating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov blamed Ukraine for attempting to disrupt the negotiations.

The key change is an increase in the minimum spending requirement to earn the signup bonus, rising 50% from $8,000 to $12,000 within the first 6 months. The bonus itself remains unchanged at as high as 175,000 Membership Rewards points, though actual offers vary by applicant and are only revealed after applying. This adjustment marks a notable shift, as it is uncommon for issuers to raise spend thresholds without boosting the points awarded. The article highlights that this makes the offer less appealing psychologically, especially compared to competitors like the Citi Strata Elite and Chase Sapphire Reserve, which require $6,000 in just three months. Despite the change, the Platinum Card retains strong first-year value due to its extensive perks, including up to $200 airline incidental credits, $200 Uber credits, $100 Saks credits, $600 Fine Hotels & Resorts credits]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/american-express-increases-minimum-spend-requirement-for-platinum-card-welcome-bonus-to-12-000</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/american-express-increases-minimum-spend-requirement-for-platinum-card-welcome-bonus-to-12-000</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 20:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Messages reveal Steve Bannon’s attempts to seek funding support for European far-right parties]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently released documents from the so-called Epstein files reveal extensive communications between Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to Donald Trump, and financier Jeffrey Epstein, highlighting Bannon’s attempts to influence European politics between 2018 and 2019. The messages show Bannon seeking support and potential funding to strengthen far-right and Eurosceptic parties ahead of the 2019 European parliamentary elections. His efforts focused on building a coordinated nationalist bloc within the European parliament, involving parties and figures from Italy, France, Germany, and several other European countries.

Bannon expressed particular interest in Italy’s Matteo Salvini, then deputy prime minister and leader of the far-right League party, as well as France’s Marine Le Pen. In one message dated March 2019, Bannon told Epstein he was focused on raising money to ensure both leaders could run full electoral slates.

The incident involved a Dongfeng eπ007 electric car that crashed in Wenshan, Yunnan province, on March 19, 2025, following a high-speed collision with a truck. Although the crash itself did not initially appear severe, the vehicle’s battery was apparently punctured, triggering a fire less than a minute after impact.

The video shows the driver exiting the car quickly but being unable to open the rear door because the retractable door handles failed to deploy. Moments later, even the driver’s own door became inoperable. Within 29 seconds, smoke filled the cabin, trapping three passengers inside as all doors remained shut. With time running out, the driver attempted to break the window using his elbow, while a bystander rushed in to help.

Rather than a true transfer, the promotion functions as a simple mileage match with no additional requirements, making it easy for many travelers to participate. The author, already experienced with airline promotions through challenges like JetBlue’s 25 for 25, decided this was a low-effort way to explore Frontier’s loyalty program.

Using real flight examples, the article evaluates the value of Frontier miles across different fare bundles, including Basic, Economy, Premium, and Business. The analysis shows that mile value can vary widely, ranging from well under one cent per mile to more than two cents, depending on route, fare class, and cash pricing. Generally, cheaper cash fares produce lower redemption value, while higher fare bundles can offer more attractive returns.

The promotion is available from February 5 through February 22, 2026, but may end earlier if Frontier distributes its total allocation of 70 million promotional miles. Based on the maximum award of 5,000 miles per person, participation is effectively capped at around 14,000 members.

To qualify, participants must already have miles or points in another airline’s legitimate loyalty program. Instead of transferring or forfeiting those miles, members simply submit a screenshot proving they hold miles in another program, along with a form provided by Frontier. Frontier then awards a matching number of Travel Miles on a one-to-one basis, subject to specific thresholds. Submissions under 1,000 miles receive a minimum of 1,000 Frontier miles, while submissions above that amount are matched up to a maximum of 5,000 m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Europe's rearmament]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this video, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez discusses the evolving security landscape in Europe, particularly focusing on the need for increased defense spending and cooperation among European nations in light of geopolitical tensions.

On January 21, eight Palestinian men, including Maher Awad and Sameer Isam Aziz Zeidan, were transported shackled from Arizona to Tel Aviv, with refueling stops in New Jersey, Ireland, and Bulgaria. They were handed over to Israeli authorities at Ben Gurion Airport and dropped at a West Bank checkpoint near Ni’lin, where locals assisted them.

Gates, 70, denied these claims in an interview with Australian channel 9News, calling them 'false' and speculating that Epstein may have been trying to defame him. He clarified that he never visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island and did not engage in any sexual relationships. Gates explained that his interactions with Epstein in 2011 were primarily focused on potential investments in scientific ventures, but he now views the meetings as a mistake.

Unlike most research that focuses on adolescents, this investigation analyzed data from 26,362 participants aged 40 to 77 using the UK Biobank. The study found that moderate cannabis usage was generally associated with larger volumes in several brain regions, particularly those with high cannabinoid receptor density, and better performance in cognitive tasks such as learning, memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Interestingly, while most regions showed positive associations, the posterior cingulate area displayed lower volume in high-use participants, highlighting the complexity of cannabis effects. Sex differences were observed, with nuanced interactions suggesting the endocannabinoid system functions differently in men and women.

Speaking Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Khanna argued that the disclosure does not meet the public’s demand for accountability and warned that further congressional action could follow if all remaining files are not released.

According to Khanna, the Justice Department identified more than 6 million documents connected to the Epstein case but released only about 3 to 3.5 million after review and redactions. Although he acknowledged that the newly disclosed records were substantial and troubling, he emphasized that they represent only roughly half of the total materials collected.

Many report entire crews vanishing overnight due to fears of detention or deportation, leaving crops like carrots unharvested and valued at nearly $1 million in some cases. This threatens contract fulfillment, potential legal actions, and even bankruptcy for affected producers, as experienced manual labor cannot be easily replaced. The issue extends beyond fields to meat and livestock processing plants, where worker shortages could slow production, reduce supply, and increase nationwide consumer prices.

Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched a pointed critique of the company’s inclusion of transgender and LGBTQ+ characters, particularly in content accessible to children. Hawley alleged that Netflix promotes what he described as a “transgender ideology,” claiming—without evidence—that nearly half of its children’s programming advances such an agenda. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos firmly rejected the assertion, stating that the figures were inaccurate and that he had no idea where they originated.

Hawley appeared to rely on claims from the conservative advocacy group Concerned Women for America, which previously asserted that 41% of certain children’s-rated Netflix series contain LGBTQ+ content. Critics note that this framing conflates all LGBTQ+ representation with transgender themes and reflects the group’s ideological bias.

The base is located near Petrozavodsk, the regional capital, only a few dozen kilometers from Finnish territory, making it strategically significant.

In recent weeks, the site has undergone rapid changes. New infrastructure has been built, military equipment has been transported in, and terrain preparation work has intensified.

Estimated to be over 4,800 years old, this remarkable tree has been alive since before the construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt, quietly enduring vast stretches of human and natural history. Its age and resilience have made it a powerful symbol of longevity and survival in extreme environments.

Methuselah was identified in the 1950s by Edmund Schulman, a dendrochronologist from the University of Arizona, who studied tree rings to understand past climates. Through careful analysis, Schulman determined that this particular bristlecone pine was thousands of years old. To protect it from vandalism and excessive human impact, its precise location within the White Mountains is kept secret.

The offer expires on February 15, 2026, with a maximum cash back of $48 per targeted card, though variations may exist. It applies only to lodging purchases made directly with the merchant, either online at greatwolf.com (US site) or in-store in the US, and is valid for one-time use. This promotion stacks with Great Wolf Lodge's flash sale on February 6, 2026, where suites can be booked at $26 per person (typically for family groups). The author notes that taxes and fees make it easy to exceed the $100 threshold, but full payment is required by the offer's expiration, often meaning non-refundable rates must be selected. Cancellation policies for the sale should be verified.

A widely shared video hosted by Global Views with Josh features personal accounts from families struggling to meet basic expenses, including a mother of four who describes her family’s financial stress despite both parents working 90-hour weeks. Fixed costs like mortgages and bills consume nearly all their income, forcing difficult choices between essential needs such as housing and food. Commentators also highlight economic challenges in traditionally Republican states, pointing to slow GDP growth, rising healthcare costs, and increasing reliance on food pantries. Analysts suggest that some voters were initially influenced by catchy slogans and memes without fully understanding how complex economic policies would affect their daily lives.

It highlights how extremist ideologies that begin on the fringes can become mainstream when supported by powerful institutions, as seen with Spain’s Falange party and contemporary U.S. far-right movements. The text discusses several areas of concern: the weaponization of law enforcement and secret police to suppress dissent, the promotion of traditional gender roles and curtailment of women's rights, autarkic economic policies favoring elites, and the erosion of intellectual freedom through censorship and educational influence. The author cites examples such as the Minneapolis immigration operations, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, far-right social media trends, and efforts to integrate conservative ideology into education.

According to the Stress in America 2025 survey, 63 percent of adults aged 18 to 34 have considered leaving the country due to concerns about the nation’s direction, a notable increase compared with previous years. More than half of parents reported similar thoughts, underscoring how widespread these concerns have become across generations.

The findings reflect a broader atmosphere of anxiety in the U.S., with 76 percent of adults saying they are more worried about the country’s future than they were in the past.

This area contained graves of dozens of Allied soldiers, primarily Australians, but also British and Polish personnel from World War II, as well as British soldiers from World War I. The destruction involved removal of gravestones, churning of topsoil, and creation of earth berms, suggesting use of heavy equipment for systematic earthworks rather than incidental bomb damage seen elsewhere around the site. Jaradah reported two operations: one clearing olive trees outside the walls and another inside affecting about 1,000 square meters, including Australian graves and areas near a memorial and visitor bench, occurring around late April or early May after Israeli withdrawal from the zone.

Previous work showed that SLU7 levels decrease during liver disease progression, contributing to cellular dedifferentiation and genomic instability, yet a residual amount remains essential for tumor cell viability in advanced stages. In this new research, conducted as part of Carla Rojo's doctoral thesis and published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, the team tested multiple strategies to silence or reduce SLU7 expression in established tumors using inducible CRISPR/Cas9, shRNAs, siRNA delivered via magnetic nanoparticles, and aptamer-conjugated siRNA for targeted delivery.

This work, housed at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is a tempera and oil on panel piece depicting Saint Anthony the Great being tormented and lifted into the air by a group of grotesque demons. It is based on a 15th-century engraving by the German artist Martin Schongauer titled Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons, but the young Michelangelo transformed it by adding vibrant colors, enhanced textures, and atmospheric depth. According to historical accounts from Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi—Michelangelo's early biographers—the artist studied real fish specimens at the market to accurately render the scaly, animal-like features of the demons, making them more lifelike and compact than in the original engraving.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Vance was asked whether he would apologize for previously labeling Pretti an “assassin” who showed up to an ICE protest with “ill intent.” Vance responded dismissively with the question, “For what?”, and maintained that his statements were justified, despite evidence that Pretti had been disarmed before being fatally shot by federal agents.

The piece explains that Vance amplified a social media post from a senior White House official on the day of the killing, portraying Pretti as a would-be attacker of federal officers. According to the article, this framing quickly became part of a broader right-wing narrative that cast Pretti as a dangerous domestic threat rather than a civilian protester.

Emails show Epstein following up over years, sometimes referencing current events like the MH17 crash to adjust timing, but there is no evidence of any positive response from Russian authorities, no direct communication with Putin, no meetings, and no Kremlin involvement.

It argues that machines, like buildings or tools, are shaped by assumptions about wear, stress, and repeated use. Rather than treating wear as a failure, the text frames it as an expected and measurable result of sustained operation. Polished surfaces, compressed seals, and shifting tolerances are presented as records of work performed, not signs of neglect.

A central theme is that thoughtful design anticipates where and how wear will occur. Engineers decide which components absorb stress and which remain stable, allowing systems to age in controlled and predictable ways. Longevity, therefore, depends less on preventing change and more on managing it within acceptable boundaries. This perspective shifts attention from avoiding wear to designing systems that can be adjusted, repaired, and realigned over time.

These pieces evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for an era that never fully materialized in the way retro-futurism once imagined, blending the ordinary with the extraordinary to pull viewers into dreamlike, otherworldly moments. The works draw heavily from 1960s photo album aesthetics, grounding the fantastical elements in recognizable, everyday Americana while placing them in impossible cosmic settings.

According to the author, Trump publicly shared a screenshot of a private conversation with Macron, an act described as an unprecedented breach of diplomatic discretion. The author argues that the true scandal is not the indiscretion itself, but the lack of substantive media coverage about the content of the exchange.

The piece claims that the conversation implicitly confirms close coordination between the United States and France regarding military and political actions in Syria, contradicting what the author portrays as the dominant media narrative of a purely internal, popular uprising against dictatorship.

To qualify, participants must register for the promotion by February 28, 2026, and book a minimum two-night stay costing at least $1,500, excluding taxes, cleaning fees, booking fees, and optional add-ons. The booking must be made through the official Homes & Villas by Marriott Bonvoy website and paid with a credit or debit card. Bonus points will be awarded in addition to the standard points and any elite-level bonuses a member may earn. The promotion period for eligible stays runs from February 2, 2026, through September 1, 2026. While the 25,000-point bonus is significant, it is limited to first-time bookings and requires a relatively high minimum spend.

This card joins the existing no-annual-fee Disney Visa Card and the $49 Disney Premier Visa Card, targeting dedicated Disney fans. The launch offer provides significant first-year value: a $300 Disney gift card upon approval and a $300 statement credit after spending $1,000 within the first three months, totaling up to $600 in rewards that can be highly useful for Disney vacations.

Earning rates include 10X points on purchases directly at DisneyPlus.com, Hulu.com, or Plus.ESPN.com, 3X at gas stations and most Disney locations, 2X at grocery stores and restaurants, and 1X on all other purchases.

The promotion runs from February 3 to March 26, 2026, and requires a minimum purchase of 2,000 points. Not all members receive the same offer: while some accounts are targeted for the full 40% bonus, others may see 35% or different bonus tiers depending on their profile and recent activity.

Although the discounted purchase price is higher than Frequent Miler’s estimated reasonable redemption value for Marriott points, the deal can still make sense in specific scenarios. It is particularly useful for travelers who need a small number of additional points to complete an award booking or who can secure high-value redemptions where points are worth more than one cent each.

Esta decisión se enmarca en el contexto de la comparecencia de Santos Cerdán, exsecretario de Organización del PSOE, ante la Comisión de Investigación del 'Caso Koldo' en el Senado, en abril de 2024. La Audiencia considera que las mentiras pueden quedar protegidas por el derecho constitucional a no autoincriminarse, lo que significa que un testigo puede falsear su testimonio para defenderse de una posible imputación posterior sin que esto constituya un delito de falso testimonio. La resolución revoca una querella que acusaba a Cerdán de mentir en su declaración, en la que aseguró haber tenido escaso contacto con Koldo García. La Audiencia resalta que el testigo tenía derecho a no declarar contra sí mismo, especialmente dado que meses después fue investigado por los mismos hechos.

Las familias afectadas se encuentran en una situación de vulnerabilidad, algunas con personas mayores, menores de edad y miembros con discapacidad. El fondo adquirió las propiedades al comprar la deuda de los inmuebles y está ejerciendo su 'derecho de propiedad', a pesar de que muchas familias llevan años viviendo en los apartamentos, algunos incluso con contratos de alquiler. El juzgado de Estepona ordenó el desahucio sin tener en cuenta los informes de los servicios sociales que acreditan la vulnerabilidad de los ocupantes.

A pesar de ser el mayor exportador de hortalizas frescas de Europa, los productores ven cómo los precios de sus productos caen drásticamente, mientras los costes de producción suben sin cesar. En el caso de los pimientos, los agricultores reciben solo 10 céntimos por kilo, un precio irrisorio frente a los 2 euros que valen en los supermercados. Además, los jóvenes agricultores, como David, se enfrentan a una escasa rentabilidad y a una fuerte burocracia que dificulta aún más su supervivencia. La falta de relevo generacional es otro de los grandes problemas, ya que solo el 6% de los titulares de explotaciones agrarias en España tienen menos de 35 años. Con el aumento de costes de fertilizantes, energía y agua, los agricultores temen que el sector se siga vaciando de manos jóvenes, dejando muchas tierras sin cultivar.

El texto sostiene que este enfoque es simplista y engañoso, ya que el sistema público de pensiones en España se financia principalmente mediante las cotizaciones sociales de los trabajadores y no a costa de recortar oportunidades a la juventud. Las aportaciones del Estado se destinan, en su mayor parte, a cubrir los denominados gastos impropios que no deberían imputarse al sistema contributivo.

El artículo recuerda que la revalorización de las pensiones no es una decisión política arbitraria ni una concesión electoral, sino el cumplimiento de un mandato constitucional recogido en el artículo 50 de la Constitución Española, que obliga a garantizar pensiones suficientes y actualizadas.

Actualmente, gran parte de la infraestructura digital de los bancos europeos se apoya en proveedores con sede en Estados Unidos. El consejero delegado de Rabobank, Stefaan Decraene, reconoce abiertamente esta situación y admite que los principales proveedores de TI de la entidad están en ese país.

A través de fuentes como Homero, Hesíodo o Heródoto, se explica que los escenarios mitológicos se sitúan en un territorio ambiguo, a medio camino entre lo real y lo imaginario, donde la precisión geográfica carece de importancia frente al valor simbólico del relato.

La geografía mitológica se caracteriza por la idealización, el aislamiento y la anacronía. Los lugares donde transcurren los mitos suelen aparecer como espacios lejanos, inaccesibles o peligrosos, pero también como paraísos o territorios “dorados”, cargados de riqueza y maravilla. Estos espacios existen únicamente para que el mito tenga lugar y no están sometidos a las leyes normales del tiempo ni del clima, lo que explica fenómenos como la luz perpetua, la noche eterna o la ause]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia plantea eliminar las últimas paradas de venta directa de los agricultores de la Huerta]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia ha anunciado su intención de modificar la Ordenanza de Mercados, incluyendo como primera medida el cierre de las últimas paradas de venta directa conocidas como la 'Tira de Comptar'.

Sin embargo, la medida más controvertida no es el precio, sino la aplicación de la cláusula de 'no renovación' para pacientes con enfermedades crónicas o de edad avanzada. Durante años, el modelo de negocio se basó en captar clientes sanos con primas bajas, pero ahora, ante el aumento del uso intensivo de la cobertura, muchas aseguradoras deciden no renovar contratos a quienes dejan de ser rentables. Además, se han endurecido los procedimientos para acceder a pruebas diagnósticas y tratamientos menores, generando retrasos que imitan las limitaciones de la sanidad pública.

En medio de la discusión, Motos aludió indirectamente a la analista política Sarah Santaolalla, quien había criticado previamente a González calificando su gestión como traidora. En ese momento, Rosa Belmonte hizo un comentario despectivo sobre Santaolalla, refiriéndose a ella con la frase '¿Esa que es la mitad tonta y la mitad tetas?'. El comentario generó silencio en el plató y fue aclarado posteriormente como una cita de la serie 'La Maravillosa señora Maisel'. Santaolalla respondió más tarde, explicando que se sintió señalada e insultada durante la emisión, y que el resto de la mesa se rió de la situación.

Aunque ninguno de los investigadores implicados participó en los delitos sexuales por los que Epstein fue condenado, los archivos revelan cómo el financiero utilizó su dinero y su influencia para rodearse de figuras clave del ámbito académico y dar apariencia de respetabilidad a ideas racistas, misóginas y eugenésicas.

Entre los nombres que aparecen figuran científicos de primer nivel relacionados con instituciones como Harvard, MIT, Princeton o Stanford. Tras su condena en 2008, Epstein continuó financiando proyectos de física, biología evolutiva y genética, organizando conferencias exclusivas y manteniendo correspondencia privada en la que se intercambiaban comentarios abiertamente sexistas y racistas.

Aunque la República Islámica es la principal responsable de la represión, la corrupción y la mala gestión económica, las políticas de «máxima presión» de la administración Trump —incluido el abandono del JCPOA en 2018— destruyeron deliberadamente la economía iraní, empobrecieron a la clase media (millones cayeron en la pobreza entre 2011 y 2019) y sabotearon las posibilidades de un cambio pacífico o reformista desde dentro.

Durante décadas, los iraníes intentaron transformar el sistema mediante elecciones, movilizaciones y reformas, pero el fracaso del acuerdo nuclear y el endurecimiento del régimen deslegitimaron estas vías. Las protestas de 2022 (por Mahsa Amini) y las de 2026, inicialmente económicas, derivaron rápidamente e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-las-sanciones-estadounidenses-contribuyeron-a-la-desesperacion-en-iran-y-al-giro-hacia-la-intervencion-militar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-las-sanciones-estadounidenses-contribuyeron-a-la-desesperacion-en-iran-y-al-giro-hacia-la-intervencion-militar</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Familias de víctimas del servicio militar reclaman investigación y transparencia sobre muertes durante la mili]]></title><description><![CDATA[Varios familiares de jóvenes fallecidos durante el servicio militar en España se han organizado para exigir justicia y esclarecer las causas de las muertes. Muchos de estos fallecimientos han sido atribuidos a suicidios o accidentes, aunque los parientes desconfían de la información oficial debido a la opacidad y la falta de detalles. La cifra de víctimas en la etapa democrática asciende al menos a 1.900, sin contar los fallecimientos durante el franquismo ni los suicidios posteriores a la mili. A raíz de un documental de TV3 titulado 'Et faran un home.

El contenido se presenta habitualmente como supuestos “recorridos a pie” o vídeos de vida nocturna, pero se centra casi exclusivamente en mujeres jóvenes, muchas veces filmadas desde ángulos bajos o por detrás, llegando a mostrar partes íntimas sin su conocimiento ni consentimiento.

La BBC identificó más de 65 canales dedicados a este tipo de material, cuyos vídeos acumulan más de 3.000 millones de visualizaciones en tres años.

Cobain murió el 5 de abril de 1994 en su hogar de Seattle, a los 27 años, por un disparo con escopeta Remington Model 11 de calibre 20. El examen oficial del Condado de King determinó en su momento que fue un suicidio. Sin embargo, un equipo privado de científicos forenses, liderado por Brian Burnett y la investigadora Michelle Wilkins, revisó la autopsia y el escenario del crimen. Tras tres días de análisis, el equipo concluyó que la evidencia era consistente con un homicidio. Señalaron que el daño en órganos como el cerebro y el hígado indicaba falta de oxígeno, más común en una sobredosis de heroína que en un disparo instantáneo. Además, la disposición de las manos, la limpieza de la mano izquierda, la ubicación de la escopeta y de los proyectiles, así como la nota de suicidio, mostraban anomalías que no encajan con un suicidio t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nueva-investigacion-forense-plantea-dudas-sobre-la-muerte-de-kurt-cobain</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nueva-investigacion-forense-plantea-dudas-sobre-la-muerte-de-kurt-cobain</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yolanda Díaz no se reúne con sindicatos nacionalistas que solicitan SMI propio]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los sindicatos nacionalistas CIG, ELA, LAB, Intersindical Catalá, IAC, Intersindical Valenciana y STEI anunciaron su intención de reunirse en Madrid con los partidos políticos del Congreso para abordar la posibilidad de establecer un salario mínimo interprofesional (SMI) adaptado a sus territorios.

El animal fue atrapado en abril de 2023 por un pescador a unas once millas náuticas entre Dénia y Jávea, cerca del Cabo de San Antonio, una zona de cañones submarinos y aguas profundas próximas a la costa. El tiburón medía alrededor de 2,1 metros y pesaba entre 80 y 90 kilos, lo que indica que se trataba de un individuo joven, muy lejos aún del tamaño adulto de esta especie.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista científica Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria, confirma que el tiburón blanco mantiene una presencia persistente pero extremadamente infrecuente en aguas españolas. Se trata de uno de los pocos registros verificados en las últimas décadas, tras avistamientos y capturas accidentales documentadas en Baleares en 2018]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tiburon-blanco-juvenil-es-capturado-accidentalmente-frente-a-alicante-y-refuerza-la-evidencia-cientifica-de-su-presencia-ocasional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tiburon-blanco-juvenil-es-capturado-accidentalmente-frente-a-alicante-y-refuerza-la-evidencia-cientifica-de-su-presencia-ocasional</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 11:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diez muertos en un tiroteo en una escuela de Columbia Británica tras el suicidio del atacante]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un tiroteo ocurrido el martes 10 de febrero en la escuela secundaria Tumbler Ridge, situada en la provincia canadiense de Columbia Británica, ha dejado al menos diez personas muertas, según confirmó la Real Policía Montada de Canadá (RCMP).

Según el informe, esta política comercial constituye el mayor aumento fiscal en Estados Unidos como porcentaje del PIB desde 1993 y está contribuyendo a agravar las preocupaciones sobre el coste de vida, afectando especialmente a productos importados como electrónica, juguetes, coches y alimentos cultivados en el extranjero. La inflación en alimentos se ha visto notablemente impactada, con subidas del 33,6% en el café, 19,3% en la carne de vacuno, 16,8% en la lechuga romana y 12,4% en el zumo de naranja congelado.

Inicialmente, impuso un arancel del 30%, pero tras una llamada con la ministra suiza Karin Keller-Sutter, que describió como agresiva, decidió elevarlo al 39%. Esta decisión ha sido objeto de burlas en redes sociales, donde usuarios señalaron que la política arancelaria de Trump parecía impulsiva y basada en su estado de ánimo, más que en una estrategia económica definida. Posteriormente, bajo presión de empresas suizas, Trump accedió a reducir los aranceles al 15%, con un acuerdo preliminar que incluye la inversión de 200.000 millones de dólares por parte de Suiza en Estados Unidos antes de 2028.

La decisión supone un gesto poco habitual por parte de este organismo, que tradicionalmente actúa como un espacio de cooperación institucional entre líderes estatales de ambos grandes partidos.

El anuncio fue comunicado a los gobernadores mediante una carta firmada por Kevin Stitt, gobernador republicano de Oklahoma y actual presidente de la NGA. En ella, Stitt explica que, al quedar excluidos los gobernadores demócratas de la reunión con el presidente, la asociación no podía seguir actuando como organizadora ni avalar un evento que contradice su misión principal: representar por igual a los 55 gobernadores y gobernadoras del país, incluidos los de estados y territorios.

Con un 66% de los votos frente al 33% del candidato ultraderechista André Ventura, Seguro se convierte en el presidente más votado de la historia democrática de Portugal. Este resultado refleja una clara apuesta ciudadana por la moderación, la estabilidad institucional y el respeto al marco democrático, frente a los discursos excluyentes y polarizadores del populismo.

Seguro, un socialdemócrata de perfil moderado y alejado de la política activa durante más de una década, ha logrado un respaldo transversal poco habitual. Su candidatura atrajo apoyos tanto de figuras conservadoras como del ámbito comunista, lo que evidencia su capacidad para presentarse como un “presidente de todos”. Este consenso se explica, en parte, por el temor de amplios sectores de la sociedad a un retroceso en derechos y libertades conquistados tras la Revolución de los Clav]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-victoria-de-antonio-jose-seguro-refuerza-la-estabilidad-democratica-en-portugal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-victoria-de-antonio-jose-seguro-refuerza-la-estabilidad-democratica-en-portugal</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 08:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El SEPRONA investiga un caso de envenenamiento de gatos con insecticida en Páramo del Sil]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Servicio de Protección de la Naturaleza (SEPRONA) de la Guardia Civil investiga a una mujer como presunta autora del envenenamiento de varios gatos en la localidad leonesa de Páramo del Sil, tras una denuncia vecinal por posibles casos de maltrato animal.

Como consecuencia de la agresión, Silver sufrió una fractura en el paladar, un fuerte traumatismo en uno de sus ojos y un importante impacto físico y emocional. Tras el rescate, el animal fue trasladado a un centro veterinario, donde permanece ingresado y recibiendo atención especializada.

Según la organización, el encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler, la escasez de vivienda social y la precariedad laboral están empujando a hogares enteros a compartir espacios reducidos y poco adecuados, generando situaciones de hacinamiento cada vez más frecuentes.

La entidad social señala que esta realidad afecta de manera especial a familias con menores, personas migrantes y trabajadores con ingresos inestables, que se ven obligados a convivir varias unidades familiares en un mismo piso o a ocupar viviendas sin las condiciones mínimas de habitabilidad. El problema no se limita al tamaño de los inmuebles, sino que también incluye deficiencias estructurales, falta de ventilación, instalaciones eléctricas inseguras y un acceso limitado a servicios básicos.

Además, se prohíbe la denominada 'contratación en caliente', obligando a las comercializadoras a enviar previamente el contrato y un documento explicativo, claro y sencillo, antes de que el consumidor firme cualquier acuerdo. Esta medida busca evitar engaños, especialmente en el caso de personas beneficiarias del bono social, que en ocasiones han perdido esta protección sin ser plenamente conscientes de las consecuencias económicas del cambio de contrato.

García Castellón reclama una indemnización de 240.000 euros por los perjuicios que, a su juicio, le causaron esas manifestaciones, realizadas en un contexto de fuerte confrontación política y judicial.

El trabajo, realizado por científicos de la Universidad Tecnológica del Sur de China y publicado en la revista Device, no plantea una fuente de energía revolucionaria, pero sí una prueba de concepto ingeniosa sobre cómo captar energía ambiental para alimentar pequeños dispositivos.

El funcionamiento del pájaro bebedor se basa en un ciclo térmico sencillo. Al mojarse el pico y la cabeza de fieltro, el agua se evapora y enfría la parte superior del juguete. Este enfriamiento provoca la condensación del vapor del líquido interno, normalmente diclorometano, lo que reduce la presión en la parte superior del tubo. Como consecuencia, el líquido asciende, se desplaza el centro de gravedad y el pájaro se inclina para “beber” de nuevo, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-experimento-demuestra-como-el-pajaro-bebedor-puede-generar-pequenas-cantidades-de-electricidad-a-partir-de-la-evaporacion-del-agua</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-experimento-demuestra-como-el-pajaro-bebedor-puede-generar-pequenas-cantidades-de-electricidad-a-partir-de-la-evaporacion-del-agua</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 07:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Documentos desclasificados revelan caso de una colombiana víctima de la red de Jeffrey Epstein desde los 12 años]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recientes desclasificaciones de documentos por parte del Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos han sacado a la luz el caso de una mujer colombiana, actualmente residente en Bogotá, que fue víctima de la red de explotación sexual liderada por Jeffrey Epstein.

A pesar de la gravedad de los hechos, la publicación de estos documentos ha generado controversia por la revictimización de la afectada: mientras que en muchos casos se protegen identidades de figuras influyentes mediante tachaduras, en este se expusieron datos personales como su ubicación actual en la capital colombiana y registros universitarios, dejándola en situación de vulner]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentos-desclasificados-revelan-caso-de-una-colombiana-victima-de-la-red-de-jeffrey-epstein-desde-los-12-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/documentos-desclasificados-revelan-caso-de-una-colombiana-victima-de-la-red-de-jeffrey-epstein-desde-los-12-anos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 04:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los científicos analizan una señal sísmica inusual en el Teide y descartan riesgo eruptivo inmediato]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una señal sísmica constante registrada en la zona de Las Cañadas del Teide ha llevado al comité asesor del Pevolca a reunirse de forma extraordinaria para evaluar la situación.

Mientras el secretario del Tesoro, Bessent, defiende retóricamente un “dólar fuerte”, Trump y su equipo aceptan e incluso fomentan su debilitamiento, lo que ha generado volatilidad financiera global, subidas del oro y movimientos hacia activos considerados refugio, como el franco suizo.

La autora sostiene que esta estrategia es peligrosa porque el dólar sigue siendo central para el comercio internacional, la deuda soberana de muchos países pobres y la fijación de precios de materias primas clave. Su debilitamiento reduce el valor de los activos en dólares y tensiona los mercados, además de encarecer las importaciones en Estados Unidos y trasladar inflación a los consumidores.

El edificio, declarado en ruina por el Ayuntamiento desde hace tiempo, sufrió el desplome de dos forjados en su parte interior. Dos de los ocupantes se encontraban en el interior en el momento del suceso, pero lograron salir ilesos con ayuda de vecinos antes de la llegada de los servicios de emergencia.

Al lugar acudieron rápidamente bomberos del CEIS Rioja, Guardia Civil, Policía Local, técnicos municipales de Urbanismo y personal de emergencias sanitarias y de Gas Natural. Tras la inspección, se confirmó que no existía riesgo para las viviendas colindantes, por lo que no fue necesario desalojarlas.

Según la sentencia, la empresa recurrió al esquirolaje interno, desviando tareas a trabajadores de nivel superior que no debían cubrir esas funciones ordinariamente, mientras todo el departamento de operaciones secundó la huelga. Esta práctica contraviene el artículo 6.5 del Real Decreto-Ley 17/1977 y la jurisprudencia del Tribunal Supremo y del Tribunal Constitucional. La condena se enmarca en un contexto de siete jornadas de huelga motivadas por la pérdida de poder adquisitivo de los trabajadores y trabajadoras de DXC.

Lo que inicialmente se presentó como una discusión sobre el impacto de esta medida en el espacio Schengen terminó convirtiéndose en un escenario dominado por mensajes de la ultraderecha, con intervenciones cargadas de desinformación y retórica xenófoba.

En la sesión participaron alrededor de 50 eurodiputados, de los cuales casi la mitad pertenecían a grupos de extrema derecha como Patriots y ECR. Desde Vox, su líder en la Eurocámara, Jorge Buxadé, lanzó acusaciones deshumanizadoras contra las personas migrantes, negando su aportación laboral y afirmando que la regularización responde a un supuesto interés electoral del Gobierno.

Según las imágenes y la información disponible, el conductor circulaba con normalidad cuando otro coche le cerró el paso de forma brusca. De ese vehículo descendieron al menos dos individuos armados, uno de los cuales apuntó directamente al parabrisas con un arma de fuego, en lo que se conoce localmente como una “encerrona”, una modalidad de robo violento cada vez más habitual en Chile.

Aunque Walz no habló de exterminio ni de campos de concentración, sus palabras provocaron duras críticas por parte de organizaciones como la Liga Antidifamación y el Museo del Holocausto, que consideraron la comparación una banalización de la tragedia nazi.

Beinart sostiene que estas reacciones revelan una obsesión por proteger la singularidad simbólica del Holocausto, incluso a costa de minimizar violaciones actuales de derechos humanos.

Según la Fiscalía, Glovo habría impuesto a sus repartidores condiciones laborales abusivas, entre ellas salarios muy por debajo del umbral de la pobreza, turnos que pueden alcanzar las doce horas diarias, descansos mínimos y una supervisión constante a través de la aplicación móvil. Los investigadores sostienen que muchos repartidores cobran alrededor de 2,50 euros por entrega, lo que se traduce en ingresos mensuales muy inferiores a los fijados en los convenios colectivos, en algunos casos hasta un 80% menos.

En concreto, se refiere al nuevo Puente Internacional Gordie Howe, una infraestructura de peaje de seis carriles que cruza el río Detroit conectando Detroit (Michigan, EE.UU.) con Windsor (Ontario, Canadá).

Una mujer de 34 años, con un largo historial de robos en Palafrugell y otras localidades de la comarca, ha ingresado en prisión después de acumular cerca de 40 detenciones. Hasta ahora, pese a la frecuencia de las intervenciones policiales, la sospechosa quedaba en libertad pocas horas después de ser arrestada, lo que generaba una sensación de impunidad entre los vecinos y frustración entre los agentes.

El ingreso en la cárcel se produjo tras una nueva detención el pasado 7 de febrero, cuando la Policía Local de Palafrugell la sorprendió saliendo de una vivienda con una bolsa, poco después de haber accedido al interior. Los agentes, que ya la conocían y llevaban tiempo realizando un seguimiento constante, procedieron a registrarla y detenerla nuevamente. Este arresto, sumado a la reiteración delictiva y al amplio historial acumulado, llevó f]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prision-preventiva-para-una-mujer-reincidente-tras-casi-40-detenciones-por-robos-en-el-baix-emporda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prision-preventiva-para-una-mujer-reincidente-tras-casi-40-detenciones-por-robos-en-el-baix-emporda</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Felipe González participa en un acto de la embajada de Israel por el 40 aniversario de las relaciones diplomáticas con España]]></title><description><![CDATA[El expresidente del Gobierno Felipe González participó en un coloquio organizado por la embajada de Israel en Madrid el 4 de febrero de 2026, como primer evento para conmemorar los 40 años del establecimiento de relaciones diplomáticas plenas entre España e Israel, formalizadas el 17 de enero de 1986 bajo su propio mandato. El acto, moderado por el periodista José Antonio Zarzalejos y al que asistieron figuras como el presidente del Senado, Pedro Rollán, sirvió para repasar la evolución bilateral, los lazos humanos y las posibilidades de cooperación futura.

Esta participación destaca por producirse en un momento de mínimas relaciones bilaterales, tras más de dos años de ofensiva israelí en Gaza —con más de 70.000 palestinos fallecidos según el artículo— y la denuncia del Gobierno de coalición español (PSOE-Sumar) como genocidio.

En inmigración, se informa de arrestos masivos por parte de ICE, incluyendo criminales peligrosos, y de una operación en Minnesota que ha retirado a más de 4.000 inmigrantes ilegales con antecedentes. Además, se menciona la reducción histórica de cruces ilegales en la frontera sur, con cero entradas durante nueve meses consecutivos.

La Administración estadounidense, liderada por Donald Trump, ha incrementado la presión sobre La Habana mediante nuevas amenazas de aranceles dirigidas a países que suministren combustible a la isla.

Durante la huida, uno de los ocupantes bajó del coche y arrojó un objeto a la vía pública antes de volver a subir rápidamente. Finalmente, los agentes lograron interceptar el vehículo y detener a sus tres ocupantes.

En el lugar donde se arrojó el objeto se recuperó una pistola Walther P38 con cachas de madera y grabado el reichsadler (águila del Reich), símbolo nazi.

En una entrevista concedida al programa Nothing Major Show, el jugador kazajo admite que el dominio ejercido por Carlos Alcaraz y Jannik Sinner, junto a un Novak Djokovic en la recta final de su carrera, ha generado una jerarquía casi infranqueable en los grandes torneos. Según Bublik, esta situación ha cambiado incluso el discurso interno del vestuario: ningún jugador del top 10 se atreve ya a verbalizar abiertamente que aspira a ganar un Grand Slam.

El tenista describe un escenario en el que solo circunstancias excepcionales, como eliminaciones tempranas de los grandes favoritos, abrirían una ventana real de oportunidad para otros jugadores. Recuerda precedentes históricos en los que el cuadro se rompió de forma inesperada y sugiere que algo así podría volver a suceder, aunque de manera muy puntual en los próximos años.

Para externalizar la gestión de un hospital público, las comunidades autónomas deberán justificar previamente la necesidad mediante un informe público, someterlo a evaluación por un comité de expertos y técnicos, y demostrar que no es viable la gestión directa, garantizando siempre la sostenibilidad financiera, calidad, continuidad, accesibilidad y asequibilidad del servicio.

Los hechos tuvieron lugar alrededor de las siete de la mañana tras una discusión motivada por celos. El agredido llamó él mismo a emergencias, aunque después minimizó lo ocurrido y se mostró reacio a presentar denuncia contra su compañera. Cuando la Policía Nacional llegó al domicilio, la mujer intentó ocultar lo sucedido alegando que las manchas de sangre en su ropa eran de pintalabios rojo. Los agentes, sospechosos ante la excusa, accedieron al interior y siguieron el rastro de sangre hasta un trastero, donde encontraron al hombre escondido en un armario con cortes profundos en la espalda, la cabeza y una mano.

Levi, de 27 años, fue arrestado inicialmente por cargos de posesión de sustancias biológicas prohibidas sin licencia federal, lo que representa un riesgo grave para la bioseguridad pública.

Los asaltantes bloquearon la vía incendiando vehículos (como una camioneta y un camión) y esparciendo elementos para impedir el tráfico, haciéndose pasar por agentes de los carabinieri mediante coches falsos equipados con luces azules intermitentes. Utilizaron explosivos de alto poder para abrir las puertas reforzadas de al menos uno de los furgones, y dispararon con fusiles de asalto tipo Kalashnikov y otras armas largas, lo que provocó un tiroteo con patrullas de los carabinieri que acudieron al lugar.

Vestidos como el personaje de Robin Hood, los participantes aseguraron que su objetivo no era el beneficio personal, sino llamar la atención sobre el fuerte aumento del coste de la vida en Canadá, especialmente el encarecimiento de los productos básicos.

Según explicaron, la acción tuvo un carácter político y simbólico, al considerar que muchas familias no pueden afrontar el precio actual de los alimentos en un contexto de inflación persistente. El reparto se realizó en puntos de acceso comunitario, utilizados habitualmente por personas con dificultades económicas, lo que refuerza el mensaje de denuncia social que el grupo quiso transmitir.

La situación se agrava por la intervención militar estadounidense en Venezuela, que ha cortado el suministro de crudo que Cuba recibía desde ese país, su principal proveedor.

Este retraso responde a varios factores, entre ellos la necesidad de centrarse en la Luna, donde SpaceX busca construir una ciudad lunar antes de 2036, lo que considera más viable en un plazo de diez años debido a la cercanía del satélite y la posibilidad de asegurar la supervivencia de los colonos. Además, la NASA, bajo la dirección de Jared Isaacman, impulsa la carrera lunar frente a China, lo que aumenta la presión sobre SpaceX para desarrollar el HLS (Human Landing System) y los sistemas de repostaje en órbita necesarios para Artemisa III en 2028.

Se plantean tres escenarios: en el conservador (Escenario A), manteniendo los votos de 2023, obtendrían entre 55 y 59 escaños, convirtiéndose en tercera fuerza. Con una movilización moderada del 10-12 % adicional (Escenario B), llegarían a 61-68 escaños, y con una fuerte movilización del 20 % (Escenario C), alcanzarían 70-75 escaños. Este crecimiento se concentraría especialmente en Andalucía, Comunidad Valenciana, Madrid y otras regiones.

Este beneficio se enmarca en seis medidas clave con evidencia científica: 1) Alimentación rica en frutas, verduras, grasas saludables (omega-3) y evitar ultraprocesados, carnes procesadas o cocinadas a altas temperaturas; 2) Ejercicio regular y control del peso para reducir inflamación y obesidad, ligada a formas más agresivas; 3) No fumar, y]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/habitos-saludables-para-prevenir-el-cancer-de-prostata-alimentacion-ejercicio-no-fumar-y-eyaculacion-frecuente-segun-estudios-cientificos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/habitos-saludables-para-prevenir-el-cancer-de-prostata-alimentacion-ejercicio-no-fumar-y-eyaculacion-frecuente-segun-estudios-cientificos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Residente de Colmenar Viejo denuncia la mala calidad de los menús en la residencia tras huelga de hambre]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marcelo Marko, residente de la residencia de mayores de Colmenar Viejo, permaneció 25 días en huelga de hambre para protestar por la calidad y cantidad de los alimentos que se sirven en el centro, gestionado por la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS).

Nicholas Carlini, investigador de Anthropic, ha mostrado cómo el modelo Claude Opus 4.6, mediante un sistema de agentes trabajando en paralelo, ha sido capaz de generar un compilador de C completo en solo dos semanas y con un coste aproximado de 20.000 dólares. Este proyecto, denominado Claude's C Compiler (CCC), consta de 100.000 líneas de código en Rust y permite compilar un kernel Linux 6.9 funcional en arquitecturas x86, ARM y RISC-V. Comparativamente, desarrollar un compilador tradicional podía implicar inversiones millonarias y años de trabajo de múltiples ingenieros. Aunque el compilador creado por la IA tiene limitaciones, como la falta de soporte para x86 de 16 bits o su propio ensamblador, el logro demuestra el potencial de la IA generativa en acelerar y abaratar desarrollos de software complejos.

La instalación, de más de 500 metros cuadrados y en funcionamiento desde 1975, es propiedad de sus abuelos, quienes se la arriendan desde que ella asumió la titularidad de la ganadería en 2022. En ella mantiene alrededor de 50 animales de raza Asturiana de los Valles, entre vacas, crías y toros.

La expropiación está vinculada al proyecto de duplicación de la vía de ancho métrico entre Pola de Siero y La Carrera. Mientras que la indemnización ofrecida a los propietarios del inmueble asciende a 37.700 euros, a Molleda se le propone una compensación de apenas 6,50 euros en concepto de daños y perjuicios por el cese forzoso de su actividad en ese emplazamiento.

Esta norma, vigente desde la administración jordana del territorio, había limitado las adquisiciones directas por parte de colonos, quienes debían recurrir a empresas registradas ante la Administración Civil israelí, dependiente del Ejército. Los ministros Bezalel Smotrich (Finanzas) e Israel Katz (Defensa) anunciaron la medida tras una reunión del Gabinete de Seguridad, destacando Smotrich que con ella se 'profundizan las raíces en toda la tierra de Israel' y se 'entierra la idea de un Estado palestino'.

Después del paso de la borrasca Marta, que se suma a una temporada especialmente activa con ya 13 borrascas de gran impacto en lo que va del invierno 2025/2026, el patrón atmosférico comenzará a modificarse de forma clara.

Durante buena parte de la semana, el chorro polar ha circulado a latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, favoreciendo la llegada de masas de aire suaves y cargadas de humedad desde el Atlántico. Sin embargo, hacia el final de la semana este chorro se volverá más sinuoso, permitiendo la entrada de aire mucho más frío desde latitudes árticas. Este cambio estará reforzado por el desplazamiento de la dorsal anticiclónica hacia el sur de las Azores y la profundización de una baja en el entorno de Italia, lo que intensificará los vientos de componente norte y noroeste sobre la Península.

Según una investigación citada por Byline Times, los archivos sugieren que Epstein no solo fue un traficante sexual con amplias conexiones políticas y empresariales, sino también un actor interesado en influir en la circulación de información y en la radicalización online.

Los documentos indican que en 2011 Epstein se reunió con Christopher Poole, fundador del foro anónimo 4chan, poco antes del relanzamiento del tablón /pol/, que posteriormente se consolidó como espacio central de la llamada alt-right. Correos de su entorno describen ese foro como un “ente colectivo” con gran potencial de manipulación, lo que apunta a un interés estratégico en comunidades digitales difíciles de rastrear pero altamente influyentes.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el congresista republicano Ted Hill, elimina la excepción que en versiones anteriores permitía izar la ikurriña en contextos culturales, como el festival Jaialdi de Boise, que celebra la profunda presencia histórica de la diáspora vasca en la región.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en la decisión del Ayuntamiento de Boise, gobernado por la demócrata Lauren McLean, de mantener la bandera del Orgullo Progresivo más allá del mes del Orgullo. En respuesta, el Capitolio de Idaho aprobó en 2023 una ley que limitaba las enseñas autorizadas en edificios gubernamentales.

Según la denuncia presentada el 18 de diciembre en el puesto principal de Aldaia, entre diez y doce personas accedieron por la fuerza a la vivienda acompañadas de un cerrajero.

El autor parte de los datos de inejecución de los Presupuestos de la Comunidad Autónoma, que superan los 2.300 millones de euros en los dos primeros años de legislatura, a los que se suman la posible pérdida de unos 500 millones procedentes de los fondos europeos del Mecanismo de Recuperación y Resiliencia. Estos datos, señala, resultan especialmente graves en un territorio que arrastra carencias estructurales en ámbitos clave como la vivienda, la sanidad, la educación o el nivel salarial, y donde el coste de la vida es de los más altos del Estado.

El subdelegado del Gobierno en Valladolid, Jacinto Canales, confirmó la detención y explicó que el edil pasó la noche en dependencias policiales.

Durante la mañana del domingo, Fernández Giralda fue puesto a disposición judicial.

Según datos de Eurostat, la proporción de población que vive en viviendas con menos habitaciones de las necesarias ha pasado del 4,7% en 2018 al 9,1% en 2024, lo que supone un incremento cercano al 94% en solo seis años. Este aumento contrasta con la evolución media del conjunto de la UE, donde el hacinamiento ha descendido ligeramente en el mismo periodo.

El fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y de la compra de vivienda, que obliga a muchas familias a reducir espacio y privacidad para poder acceder a un techo. Aunque España no se sitúa entre los países con mayores tasas absolutas —muy por debajo de algunos Estados del este de Europa—, sí destaca por la intensidad del crecimiento, solo comparable al caso de Irlanda.

Según la sentencia, los hechos ocurrieron en la madrugada del 1 de diciembre de 2023, después de que agresor y víctima, que mantenían una relación de amistad y compartían problemas de salud mental, salieran juntos de fiesta y consumieran alcohol y drogas.

El estudio, basado en registros civiles y documentación archivística, demuestra que estos centros vivieron una situación extrema de abandono institucional a medida que avanzaba el conflicto bélico.

Casos como el de Josep, un paciente de Tàrrega ingresado primero en el Institut Pere Mata de Reus y posteriormente trasladado a Sant Boi, ilustran el drama vivido por miles de internos.

Las advertencias de Pekín no se interpretan como un gesto hostil directo, sino como parte de una estrategia de diversificación y protección frente a la volatilidad de los activos estadounidenses.

El obturador es el elemento que controla el tiempo durante el cual la luz llega al sensor, influyendo directamente en la exposición y en la capacidad de congelar el movimiento.

El obturador mecánico, basado en cortinillas físicas, sigue siendo muy utilizado por su fiabilidad en todo tipo de condiciones de iluminación, su compatibilidad con el flash y su capacidad para capturar escenas con movimientos rápidos sin distorsiones. Sin embargo, presenta limitaciones como el ruido, las vibraciones y velocidades máximas más reducidas.

Por su parte, el obturador electrónico prescinde de elementos físicos y se basa en la lectura progresiva del sensor.

Este éxodo, uno de los episodios más trágicos de la Guerra Civil, dejó entre 3.000 y 5.000 víctimas civiles, en su mayoría mujeres, niños y ancianos, que fueron bombardeados por mar y aire durante el camino.

Pese a que el cine español ha tratado la Guerra Civil en más de un centenar de películas, ninguna había reflejado hasta ahora este episodio concreto. Arijo, que ha investigado a fondo la filmografía sobre el conflicto, considera que existía una deuda narrativa con la Desbandá. Su motivación es también personal: relatos familiares, como el de una tía de su padre que vivió aquella huida siendo niña, le hicieron tomar conciencia del sufrimiento cotidiano y silencioso que marcó a toda una generación.

El objeto, de apenas 63 milímetros de longitud y unos 1,5 gramos de peso, data del cuarto milenio antes de nuestra era y adelanta en más de dos milenios el uso fiable de la perforación rotatoria en Egipto.

Durante décadas, la pieza fue catalogada de forma imprecisa como una simple lezna de cobre, siguiendo una descripción escueta realizada en los años veinte por el arqueólogo Guy Brunton. Sin embargo, un nuevo reanálisis mediante microscopía ha revelado patrones de desgaste incompatibles con un uso por presión o percusión. Estrías finas, bordes redondeados y una ligera curvatura en la punta indican un movimiento rotatorio rápido y sostenido.

Aunque históricamente fue un pez muy abundante y presente en casi toda la península ibérica, la anguila ha perdido más del 80 % de su distribución original. El colapso más grave se produjo a partir de los años ochenta, coincidiendo con una intensificación de su explotación comercial, especialmente tras el declive de la anguila japonesa.

En declaraciones realizadas en Mataró, donde participó en un acto sobre economía social, Díaz alertó de lo que calificó como una «emergencia democrática sin precedentes», tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.

La dirigente de Sumar se refirió al contexto político tras las elecciones autonómicas en Aragón, en las que el Partido Popular ganó en escaños pero perdió apoyos y seguirá dependiendo de Vox para gobernar. A partir de estos resultados, Díaz acusó al líder del PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, de haber convertido a su partido en una «maquinaria de engorde de Vox», al considerar que su estrategia política contribuye a fortalecer a la extrema derecha en lugar de aislarla.

Maxwell, quien cumple una condena de 20 años por su papel en la red de tráfico sexual de menores organizada por Epstein, se acogió a la Quinta Enmienda para no declarar, evitando así autoincriminarse. Su abogado ha señalado que Maxwell estaría dispuesta a ofrecer información completa sobre las relaciones de Donald Trump y Bill Clinton con Epstein, siempre que se le conceda inmunidad penal. La comparecencia, que duró menos de una hora y se celebró a puerta cerrada, dejó sin respuesta las preguntas de los congresistas sobre la red de explotación sexual y los responsables involucrados. La familia de Virginia Giuffre, víctima destacada de Epstein, calificó a Maxwell como un personaje cruel que controlaba a las víctimas de Epstein, comparándola con una figura manipuladora y señalando que merece permanecer en prisión.

Acudió primero al Centro de Salud de Guía de Isora, donde le indicaron que debía ser derivada al Hospital del Sur, situado a 25 kilómetros. Sin embargo, la ambulancia no llegó tras cuatro horas de espera, por lo que decidió trasladarse por sus propios medios. Una vez en el Hospital del Sur, los médicos determinaron que su dolencia no podía tratarse allí y requería traslado urgente al Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, en Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a más de 100 kilómetros de distancia. Tras esperar una hora y media por la ambulancia, la paciente murió durante el trayecto.

La Plataforma Pro Hospital Público del Sur de Tenerife ha denunciado este trágico suceso, que atribuye a las carencias estructurales y de recursos del Hospital del Sur (conocido como El Mojón), un centro que lleva décadas sin ampliación adecuada pese a las reivindicaciones vecinales durante más de 30 a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instituciones culturales europeas reclaman a la Comunidad de Madrid que reconsidere el recorte al Círculo de Bellas Artes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 72 instituciones culturales europeas, integradas en la European Alliance of Academies, han expresado públicamente su apoyo al Círculo de Bellas Artes (CBA) tras el drástico recorte de financiación anunciado por la Comunidad de Madrid. El Gobierno regional ha pasado de conceder una subvención anual de 250.000 euros a limitar la ayuda prevista para 2026 a apenas 12.500 euros, destinados por ahora a la tradicional lectura continuada de El Quijote. La Alianza considera que revertir esta decisión sería una forma clara de despejar las sospechas de que el recorte obedece a motivos ideológicos o políticos y de demostrar que la libertad artística no está en riesgo en la región.

Desde 1983, el CBA recibía una subvención nominativa que gestionaba con autonomía. En los últimos años esta ayuda se había mantenido estable en 250.000 euros, aunque en 2025 se redujo a 100.000 y se condicionó a la financiación de actividades concretas.

Shipp sostiene que Epstein organizaba fiestas con drogas y prostitutas con el objetivo principal de obtener material de chantaje y espionaje contra figuras políticas y de alto nivel. Durante estos eventos, un miembro de la CIA supuestamente tomaba notas detalladas de las conversaciones. Entre las personas cercanas a Epstein menciona al exprimer ministro israelí Ehud Barak, cuya presencia en la residencia de Epstein en Nueva York está documentada en fotografías y se enmarca en operaciones de inteligencia secretas.

Las señales, firmadas por las juventudes falangistas de España, mostraban la silueta de un hombre agrediendo a una mujer mayor, un mensaje considerado por las autoridades locales como una clara incitación al odio y al racismo.

La mayoría de los estados se han negado a entregar esta información sin procesar, lo que ha llevado al DOJ a demandar a más de 20 estados. Sin embargo, al menos 10 estados —con más de 37 millones de votantes registrados— han proporcionado sus listas completas, algunos firmando un 'memorando de entendimiento confidencial'.

El tribunal considera que el padre no tenía obligación legal de seguir abonando dicha pensión desde 2018, año en que falleció la madre del joven. La pensión se había fijado inicialmente en una sentencia de medidas paternofiliales a favor de la madre como progenitora custodio tras la separación de la pareja en 2015. Tras el fallecimiento de esta, la obligación de alimentos en ese procedimiento quedó extinguida, por lo que el pago posterior realizado por el padre fue voluntario y no exigible legalmente.

El acuerdo se ha alcanzado mediante un memorando de entendimiento entre la Alianza EuroPA, de la que forma parte Bizum, y la European Payments Initiative (EPI), impulsora de la solución Wero. Para hacerlo posible se creará en el primer semestre del año una entidad central de interoperabilidad que conectará las distintas plataformas, permitiendo pagos de cuenta a cuenta sin fricciones entre países.

Mehmet Oz, administrador de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid, subrayó que el sarampión es una enfermedad altamente contagiosa y potencialmente grave para la que existe una solución eficaz y segura: la vacuna.

En declaraciones a la CNN, Oz reconoció que no todas las enfermedades afectan por igual a toda la población, pero insistió en que el sarampión es un caso claro en el que la vacunación es fundamental, especialmente para proteger a la infancia. Los brotes más recientes han afectado a cientos de personas en estados como Carolina del Sur, superando incluso cifras registradas en Texas en 2025, y se han detectado también casos en la frontera entre Utah y Arizona, además de otros estados.

Se destacan los fracasos estratégicos de Washington en conflictos clave como los de Líbano, Siria, Irak y Yemen, donde las acciones militares de EE.UU. no han logrado sus objetivos geopolíticos. En Líbáno, los ataques israelíes con apoyo estadounidense contra Hezbolá no destruyeron su capacidad de resistencia, sino que fortalecieron su posición. En Siria, las sanciones y bombardeos no impidieron la caída del gobierno de Assad ni el avance de grupos respaldados por Irán. En Irak, la expulsión de milicias proiraníes por el gobierno chiíta marcó un revés para la política exterior de Trump. Yemen representa otro fracaso, con los hutíes manteniendo su control pese a la intervención saudí respaldada por EE.UU.

Según la Fiscalía, Mouliaá y Errejón mantuvieron previamente conversaciones por redes sociales que evidenciaban un interés mutuo y acordaron verse en octubre de 2021 durante la presentación de un libro en Madrid. Tras el acto, acudieron juntos a una fiesta organizada por amigos de la actriz.

Alemany ha tratado de evitar un choque frontal con Rufián, enmarcando su iniciativa como un debate legítimo que interpela al conjunto de la organización, pero ha dejado claro que la estrategia republicana pasa por fortalecer “izquierdas nacionales enraizadas territorialmente” como respuesta al avance de la extrema derecha.

Esta cifra incluso supera los 273 millones que ya quedaron sin utilizar en 2024, lo que evidencia una baja ejecución sostenida en un área clave en un contexto de fuerte crisis de acceso a la vivienda en la región.

El contraste se produce al observar la evolución del gasto sanitario, donde sí se han aprobado ampliaciones de crédito. Entre ellas, destaca una inyección adicional de 25 millones de euros destinada a pagos a Quirón Salud. Este tipo de trasvases presupuestarios no es nuevo. En 2022, el Ejecutivo regional transfirió más de 191 millones de euros desde el remanente de tesorería de la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS) al Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS) para cubrir pagos por actividad asistencial realizada con medios privados.

En ese contexto, la elección de Bad Bunny —artista puertorriqueño, que canta en español y con un discurso político implícito— provocó una reacción inmediata de indignación en sectores conservadores y trumpistas, que vieron la decisión como una afrenta a su idea de identidad nacional.

Los personajes principales —Lem, Casandra, AsimoV y Chess— observan desde la orilla del estanque cómo el domoide central, una especie de seudocasa con rasgos antropomórficos (puerta-boca, ventanas-ojos y chimenea), se transforma de forma inquietante. Los cuatro pequeños clones de los protagonistas (Minichess, Minicas, Cuasimov y Minilem), que habían entrado a explorar, son expulsados muertos y desnudos, lo que genera alarma y sospechas de que el urbionte devora esencias o almas, dejando solo carcasas.

El detonante inmediato fue el cese de Marcos Francoy, asesor del partido en las Cortes de Aragón, tras difundirse mensajes racistas, antisemitas y de exaltación fascista en sus redes sociales. Aunque Vox intentó inicialmente desvincularse alegando que se trataba de opiniones personales, la presión mediática y política forzó su destitución, provocando además tensiones en el gobierno autonómico de coalición con el PP.

Más allá de este caso, el foco se amplía hacia el portavoz autonómico de Vox, Alejandro Nolasco, quien ha publicado varios libros en SND Editores, una editorial señalada por su cercanía a figuras históricas y contemporáneas del neonazismo español.

A más de mil kilómetros de cualquier núcleo urbano y con presencia humana muy limitada, este enclave parecía a salvo de uno de los símbolos más comunes del paisaje urbano contemporáneo: el grafiti.

Esta declaración surgió como respuesta a un comentario del comentarista conservador Matt Walsh, quien criticó un anuncio publicitario emitido durante la Super Bowl en el que varias mujeres, que afirmaron haber sido víctimas de Epstein y su círculo, pedían al fiscal general Pam Bondi que apoyara su causa y liberara más información. Walsh cuestionaba por qué estas mujeres no habían nombrado directamente a los responsables, sugiriendo que podrían hacerlo de forma protegida a través de congresistas o que su campaña parecía haber comenzado justo tras la salida de Joe Biden del poder.

Babiš señaló directamente al entonces primer ministro británico Boris Johnson como el principal responsable, afirmando que tras su visita a Kiev las negociaciones se descarrilaron y se perdió la oportunidad de poner fin rápido al conflicto.

El político checo también comentó que actualmente los esfuerzos diplomáticos para terminar la guerra se han intensificado, aunque considera que Europa por sí sola no podrá lograrlo. En su opinión, Donald Trump es un actor clave para alcanzar la paz, ya que sin su implicación no será posible establecer garantías de seguridad estables para Ucrania.

Meidner, judío alemán criado en un entorno liberal y asimilado, fue testigo directo del colapso de la democracia alemana y del ascenso del nazismo, incluyendo episodios clave como el incendio del Reichstag y la represión de la izquierda. Estas vivencias alimentaron en él una convicción duradera: el fascismo no era un accidente, sino una posibilidad real del capitalismo en crisis.

Tras huir a Suecia en 1933, Meidner se integró en un país gobernado por la socialdemocracia y desarrolló allí la mayor parte de su carrera como economista jefe de la Confederación Sueca de Sindicatos (LO). Desde ese puesto fue coautor del modelo Rehn-Meidner, que impulsó la política salarial solidaria para reducir desigualdades y fortalecer la cohesión de la clase trabajadora.

El show, seguido por millones de espectadores en todo el mundo, incluyó algunos de sus mayores éxitos y la participación de artistas invitados como Lady Gaga y Ricky Martin, lo que generó una amplia conversación en redes sociales y medios de comunicación.

Aunque una parte importante del público y de la crítica valoró positivamente la puesta en escena por su impacto global y su mensaje cultural, la actuación también despertó rechazo en determinados sectores.

La sentencia, ya firme, se basa principalmente en una prueba de ADN concluyente: los forenses hallaron saliva de la denunciante en el envoltorio del preservativo utilizado, lo que coincide con la versión del acusado de que fue ella quien lo abrió con la boca porque él estaba nervioso. Los jueces argumentan que 'ningún sentido tendría que la víctima facilitara al agresor la penetración' de esa forma, lo que considera incompatible con una violación.

Aunque el testimonio de la joven cumplía los requisitos para desvirtuar la presunción de inocencia y fue corroborado por amigas y policías (relató bloqueo y falta de consentimiento), el tribunal también valoró positivamente la declaración del acusado por su coherencia y claridad.

El contenido fue difundido como un mapa que mostraba el riesgo de rotura de presas, lo que generó preocupación y sensación de alarma entre parte de la audiencia. Sin embargo, la información contenida en el mapa no se correspondía con esa interpretación.

Según aclaró la Asociación Meteorológica del Sureste (AMETSE), el documento mostraba en realidad el riesgo potencial para la población en caso de una hipotética rotura, no la probabilidad real de que dichas presas fallaran. Es decir, el mapa señalaba aquellas infraestructuras cuya rotura, en el escenario más desfavorable posible, podría causar graves daños a núcleos urbanos, servicios esenciales o al medio ambiente.

El paro, convocado para los días 9, 10 y 11 de febrero, se produce tras los graves accidentes de Adamuz (Córdoba) y Gelida (Barcelona), que han dejado 47 víctimas mortales, y tiene como principal objetivo exigir mayores niveles de seguridad, mantenimiento de la red y refuerzo de personal.

El seguimiento está siendo elevado, sobre todo en Catalunya y el País Vasco, según los sindicatos. En el caso catalán, se han registrado incidencias adicionales por problemas en la aplicación de los servicios mínimos, que los representantes sindicales atribuyen a que Renfe comunicó tarde dichas obligaciones a los maquinistas.

Esta alerta se produjo tras el estreno en Netflix de un documental sobre la desaparición de Madeleine McCann, en cuyo tercer episodio periodistas portugueses recordaban el escándalo de abusos sexuales a menores en la institución benéfica Casa Pia.

El correo electrónico, titulado 'Jeffrey Epstein', señala que, según los periodistas (incluida Felícia Cabrita), era un 'hecho conocido' que millonarios estadounidenses viajaban a Portugal en aviones privados para abusar sexualmente de niños de la Casa Pia, supuestamente con la connivencia de altos cargos de la institución desde los años 60.

El texto deja claro desde el inicio que no asume como verificados muchos de los hechos sugeridos en el vídeo y que el caso Epstein se utiliza más como metáfora de una corrupción sistémica que como un análisis jurídico riguroso.

El núcleo del discurso examinado presenta a las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas como un bloque homogéneo, coordinado y moralmente corrupto, enfrentado a una sociedad “normal”. Para ello, el vídeo recurre a metáforas como la “punta del iceberg”, a la insinuación constante de encubrimientos institucionales y a una ambigüedad estratégica que sugiere conexiones sin afirmarlas explícitamente. Esta forma de narrar permite mantener la sensación de misterio y conspiración sin comprometerse con afirmaciones verificables.

El descenso ha afectado especialmente a Zaragoza y Huesca, mientras que Teruel mantiene su representación. La extrema derecha, representada por Vox, ha crecido hasta casi el 18%, reforzando su capacidad de negociación para un posible pacto de gobierno. En las grandes ciudades aragonesas, el PP ha sufrido retrocesos significativos en porcentaje de voto en nueve de las diez principales urbes, destacando descensos de hasta el 10% en localidades como Calatayud.

Se destacan casos concretos de afectadas como Esther y María, quienes denunciaron cobros indebidos por servicios no prestados tras el cambio de Programa Individual de Atención o el fallecimiento de sus familiares.

España invierte en educación universitaria, pero su mercado laboral no absorbe a todos los titulados debido a salarios bajos, precariedad, elevado coste de la vida y escasa inversión en I+D (solo el 1,5 % del PIB frente al 2,2 % de media europea). Esto genera una 'trampa de desarrollo de talento' en regiones como Extremadura, Castilla y León o Castilla-La Mancha, que pierden población activa cualificada, lo que frena el crecimiento económico y debilita servicios públicos, creando un círculo vicioso. Aunque la fuga española es más interna (hacia Madrid y la costa) que externa, destinos como Alemania, Bélgica, Países Bajos e Italia atraen a muchos profesionales.

Nacido en Sevilla en 1960, fue guitarrista, cantaor y compositor, y uno de los principales impulsores de la fusión entre flamenco, rock y blues que marcó una ruptura estética y sonora a finales de los años setenta y durante la década de los ochenta.

Su trayectoria pública comenzó con el grupo Veneno, formado en 1977 junto a su hermano Raimundo Amador y Kiko Veneno. Aunque el único disco del grupo fue inicialmente incomprendido por crítica y público, con el tiempo se convirtió en una obra fundamental por su carácter innovador. Tras la disolución de Veneno, los tres músicos participaron en proyectos clave como el álbum “La leyenda del tiempo” de Camarón de la Isla, que supuso un punto de inflexión en el flamenco moderno.

Su recuerdo de Mourinho es especialmente positivo y se articula en torno a una idea central: liderazgo, claridad y protección del futbolista. Wright-Phillips describe al técnico portugués como una figura intensa y carismática, capaz de generar un fuerte vínculo emocional con sus jugadores, tratarles con justicia y asumir toda la presión mediática para liberar al vestuario. Desde anécdotas explosivas, como una bronca con patada voladora incluida, hasta decisiones tácticas milimétricas que acababan en victoria, el exextremo subraya que todo estaba calculado y que esa seguridad se transmitía al grupo.

El contraste llega tras la salida de Mourinho y la llegada de Avram Grant, momento que Wright-Phillips identifica como un punto de ruptura emoci]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shaun-wright-phillips-repasa-su-carrera-y-explica-por-que-mourinho-marco-su-etapa-en-el-chelsea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/shaun-wright-phillips-repasa-su-carrera-y-explica-por-que-mourinho-marco-su-etapa-en-el-chelsea</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La exclusión sistemática de las mujeres en Afganistán bajo el régimen talibán, documentada por Valentina Sinis]]></title><description><![CDATA[El regreso de los talibanes al poder en Afganistán ha supuesto una regresión drástica en los derechos y libertades de las mujeres, materializada en más de setenta leyes que restringen su presencia en la vida pública y privada. La fotoperiodista italiana Valentina Sinis ha documentado esta realidad en su proyecto “Si las mujeres afganas desvelaran sus historias”, por el que ha sido finalista del premio Luis Valtueña. Sus imágenes y testimonios muestran cómo la exclusión femenina se ha normalizado hasta extremos cotidianos, como parques infantiles vacíos de niñas o calles donde las mujeres apenas pueden circular solas.

Las niñas afganas ya no pueden estudiar más allá de sexto grado y las mujeres tienen prohibido trabajar en la mayoría de sectores, acceder libremente a la atención sanitaria o compartir espacios con hombres fuera de su familia. Incluso se les veta la entrada a jardines públicos, símbolo de una expulsión deliberada del espacio común.

La advertencia se ha emitido mediante un aviso oficial a navegantes (Notam), válido durante un mes, hasta el 11 de marzo, en el que se especifica que el combustible JET A1 no estará disponible. Esta situación afecta a todas las terminales internacionales del país, incluido el aeropuerto José Martí de La Habana, así como los de Varadero, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Camagüey, Santa Clara, Cienfuegos, Cayo Coco y Manzanillo.

Las aerolíneas más afectadas son principalmente compañías estadounidenses, españolas, panameñas y mexicanas, aunque por el momento ninguna ha detallado públicamente cómo adaptará sus operaciones.

Los hermanos Aragón Bermúdez debutaron en 1939, en plena posguerra española, cuando el país acababa de salir devastado de la Guerra Civil. Procedentes de una extensa familia de artistas de circo, asumieron desde el principio los roles clásicos del trío de payasos: Gaby como clown autoritario, Fofó como augusto bromista y Miliki como contra-augusto, papel que desempeñó desde niño.

La España franquista, empobrecida y represiva, ofrecía pocas oportunidades, por lo que en 1946 decidieron emigrar. Su salto decisivo fue Cuba, donde no solo actuaron en vivo, sino que entraron muy pronto en la televisión, un medio todavía incipiente en el mundo hispano. Desde La Habana, sus programas se exportaron a numerosos países y los convirtieron en figuras internacionales.

Ambas sufrían lesiones físicas, un profundo agotamiento y una sensación de extrañeza que no asociaban al consumo habitual de alcohol. Esa falta de memoria y la necesidad de comprender qué les había pasado las llevó a repetir el mismo recorrido de la noche de la agresión: los mismos bares, las mismas consumiciones y el mismo trayecto, con el objetivo de descartar que hubiera sido culpa suya o una mala decisión propia.

Durante ese proceso, preguntaron a personas cercanas y reflexionaron sobre su comportamiento habitual, concluyendo que nunca se habían marchado con desconocidos ni habían experimentado antes una situación similar. La reconstrucción, que terminó de madrugada sin incidentes, les confirmó que algo grave había ocurrido y reforzó la convicción de que habían sido ví]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-victimas-de-una-violacion-con-sumision-quimica-en-pamplona-relatan-como-reconstruyeron-los-hechos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-victimas-de-una-violacion-con-sumision-quimica-en-pamplona-relatan-como-reconstruyeron-los-hechos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sheinbaum defiende el apoyo a Cuba y busca vías diplomáticas para reanudar envíos de petróleo sin sanciones de EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, confirmó el 7 de febrero de 2026 que su gobierno continúa explorando vías diplomáticas para reanudar las ventas de petróleo a Cuba, interrumpidas en enero por Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) ante las amenazas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump de imponer aranceles a los países que suministren crudo a la isla. Sheinbaum defendió el apoyo humanitario a Cuba y aseguró que la isla cumple con sus pagos contractuales, sin facturas pendientes. En 2025, las ventas alcanzaron casi 500 millones de dólares (496 millones según Pemex), representando menos del 1 % de la producción mexicana de crudo, combinando motivos humanitarios y comerciales. El director de Pemex, Víctor Rodríguez, destacó que existe un contrato vigente desde 2023 y que Cuba paga puntualmente. La suspensión de envíos coincidió con la crisis energética en Cuba tras la interrupción de suministros venezolanos (debido a la captura de Nicolás Maduro por fuerzas estadounidenses) y rusos. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[México envía 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba con buques de la Armada por instrucción de Sheinbaum]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de México, bajo la dirección de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum, ha enviado más de 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba. Dos buques de la Armada de México, el Papaloapan y el Isla Holbox, zarparon el 8 de febrero de 2026 desde el puerto de Veracruz con víveres destinados a la población civil de la isla. El buque Papaloapan transporta aproximadamente 536 toneladas de alimentos básicos como leche líquida, carne procesada, galletas, frijol, arroz, atún, sardinas, aceite vegetal y artículos de higiene personal. Por su parte, el Isla Holbox lleva más de 277 toneladas de leche en polvo. Esta operación responde a necesidades inmediatas de la población cubana y forma parte de la tradición solidaria de México con los pueblos de América Latina.

Actualmente existen 150 pisos turísticos, todos situados en urbanizaciones de las afueras. La medida establece que estos alojamientos no podrán superar el 15% del total de viviendas del municipio y, además, deberán ubicarse fuera del nucli antic (casco antiguo), que cuenta con un castillo declarado Bien de Interés Cultural.

El alcalde, José Luis Susmozas, explica que en los últimos dos o tres años los precios de la vivienda se han duplicado: casas de cien metros cuadrados han pasado de 200.000 a 400.000 euros, lo que dificulta el acceso a la vivienda a precios asequibles para los residentes.

El escrito solicitaba que la presidenta regional, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, rectificara y pidiera disculpas por unas declaraciones en las que defendía al cantante Julio Iglesias tras las denuncias por abuso sexual realizadas por varias extrabajadoras de su entorno.

La controversia se originó después de que Ayuso cuestionara públicamente una investigación periodística de elDiario.es que recogía testimonios detallados de mujeres que acusaban al artista de abusos. En un mensaje publicado en la red social X, la presidenta contrapuso esas denuncias con la situación de las mujeres en Irán, acusando a la izquierda de silencio cómplice y defendiendo la figura de Julio Iglesias como un símbolo cultural que, a su juicio, no debía ser desprestigiado.

Bret Devereaux explica que los romanos no sustituyeron la lanza por el gladius, ya que muchas infanterías mediterráneas también llevaban espada como arma secundaria, sino que reemplazaron la lanza por dos pila, una jabalina excepcionalmente pesada y diseñada para un uso táctico muy concreto.

A partir de fuentes literarias limitadas y a menudo tardías, combinadas con datos arqueológicos, el autor sitúa la consolidación de este sistema entre los siglos IV y III a.C., en un contexto de profundas reformas militares tras derrotas traumáticas y de la progresiva centralización del ejército romano como milicia ciudadana organizada por el Estado.

El texto parte de una reflexión personal sobre cómo las ciudades cambian con el tiempo y cómo mirar al pasado permite entender mejor el presente urbano.

Uno de los ejemplos más destacados es el dibujo del Palacio de Valsaín, residencia real construida por orden de Felipe II sobre un antiguo pabellón de caza medieval.

A través de una escena cotidiana aparentemente banal —pasar productos por el escáner, cobrar y despedir al cliente con una frase aprendida— el autor subraya cómo esa rutina esconde jornadas largas, salarios bajos y una presión constante por mantener la sonrisa pese al cansancio.

Tras una investigación abierta por el Defensor del Pueblo, la empresa se comprometió a instalar fuentes de agua potable gratuitas a disposición de los viajeros en los aeropuertos que gestiona. Además, limitó el precio máximo de las botellas de agua en las máquinas expendedoras a 1,60 euros, medida que buscaba paliar las críticas por los importes desproporcionados que se cobraban en estos entornos. La memoria de actividad del Defensor del Pueblo recoge que esta decisión puso fin a la actuación iniciada por las reclamaciones ciudadanas. Paralelamente, el informe destaca otras preocupaciones de los usuarios, como la progresiva pérdida de espacio público en los aeropuertos debido a su conversión en grandes áreas comerciales]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aena-se-compromete-a-instalar-fuentes-de-agua-potable-y-limitar-el-precio-del-agua-embotellada-en-aeropuertos-tras-quejas-al-defensor-del-pueblo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aena-se-compromete-a-instalar-fuentes-de-agua-potable-y-limitar-el-precio-del-agua-embotellada-en-aeropuertos-tras-quejas-al-defensor-del-pueblo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Absuelto en Jaén un hombre acusado de violar a su hija tras la retractación de la joven en el juicio]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Sección Tercera de la Audiencia Provincial de Jaén ha absuelto a un hombre de 50 años que estaba acusado de violar y realizar tocamientos sexuales a su hija cuando esta tenía 10 años. Los hechos denunciados se remontan a 2017, cuando la madre presentó la denuncia tras descubrir una conversación en una tablet. En aquel momento, la menor relató que su padre aprovechaba cualquier ocasión para tocarla de forma sexual y la amenazaba con no volver a ver a su madre si lo contaba.

Durante el juicio, la hija, ahora de 18 años, se retractó completamente de la acusación. Declaró ante el tribunal que todo lo que dijo en su día fue mentira y que lo hizo presionada por su madre y por la excuñada de esta. Afirmó que nunca sufrió tocamientos ni violación, que llevaba años viviendo una mentira y que deseaba poder abrazar a su padre, algo impedido por la orden de alejamiento vigente.

Entre los sindicatos excluidos se encuentra el propio SFF-CGT, pese a ser uno de los que cuenta con mayor implantación en el sector y representación en empresas clave como Adif, Renfe, Iryo, Ouigo y Serveo, tanto en el ámbito público como en el privado.

Desde el sindicato consideran que esta exclusión no puede interpretarse como un simple error administrativo, sino como una decisión política consciente.

Con el 98% del escrutinio completado, la candidatura encabezada por María Goikoetxea se ha situado por debajo del 2% de los sufragios, lo que supone un fuerte retroceso respecto a los comicios de 2023 y la pérdida del único escaño que mantenía la formación morada en el parlamento autonómico.

Goikoetxea ha reconocido que se trata de un mal resultado tanto para Podemos Aragón como para la pluralidad política en la comunidad, subrayando que la convocatoria electoral impulsada por el Partido Popular no ha logrado su objetivo de alcanzar la mayoría absoluta, pero sí ha contribuido a reforzar a la extrema derecha.

La trabajadora reconoció los hechos y asumió la responsabilidad, alegando que tomaba la decisión cuando ya no quedaban clientes en la sala de ventas.

Según el Servicio Federal de Seguridad (FSB), el detenido es Liubomir Korba, ciudadano ucraniano, arrestado gracias a una operación realizada en cooperación con las autoridades de Emiratos Árabes Unidos. Moscú sostiene que Korba actuó siguiendo instrucciones de los servicios de inteligencia ucranianos y que viajó a la capital rusa en diciembre de 2025 con el objetivo de cometer el atentado.

Tras abrir fuego contra el general en un edificio residencial del noroeste de Moscú, el sospechoso habría abandonado Rusia pocas horas después y volado a Dubái, donde finalmente fue localizado y detenido.

El resultado es especialmente relevante porque el distrito había sido ganado por Donald Trump por 13 puntos en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, lo que llevó a los republicanos a considerar este escaño como una oportunidad clara para recuperarlo.

La elección especial se convocó tras la salida del anterior representante estatal, también demócrata, que fue nombrado comisionado del Departamento de Alcohol y Tabaco del estado por el gobernador republicano Jeff Landry. Aunque el escaño ya estaba en manos demócratas y, por tanto, no supone un cambio de partido, la magnitud de la victoria de Verret Martinez destaca por representar un giro de 37 puntos respecto a los resultados de 2024 en ese mismo distrito.

Aunque el área no estaba incluida inicialmente en zonas de vigilancia arqueológica, la Evaluación Ambiental estableció un seguimiento preventivo que ha permitido documentar hallazgos relevantes sin paralizar el proyecto.

Entre los descubrimientos destaca una necrópolis islámica de época andalusí, formada por enterramientos sencillos excavados directamente en la tierra y sin ajuar funerario. Los restos óseos aparecieron en niveles muy superficiales, junto a materiales cerámicos fragmentados y restos de vidrio. Este hallazgo se suma a otras necrópolis islámicas ya documentadas en barrios históricos como el Carmen, la Xerea o la Almoina, reforzando el conocimiento sobre la València musulmana.

Según la resolución, Mohammadi ha sido condenada a seis años de cárcel por los cargos de congregación y colusión, y a un año y medio adicional por actividades propagandísticas.

Un ejemplo poco conocido es la rebelión de esclavos afroamericanos que tuvo lugar en 1842 en territorio de la nación Cherokee, un episodio que cuestiona los relatos tradicionales sobre opresores y oprimidos.

A comienzos del siglo XIX, varias naciones indígenas del sureste de Estados Unidos —entre ellas los Cherokee— optaron por adoptar costumbres europeas para intentar sobrevivir a la presión del gobierno federal y de los colonos. Este proceso de asimilación, que les valió el nombre de las “Cinco Tribus Civilizadas”, incluyó la adopción del cristianismo, la agricultura de plantación y, de forma clave, la esclavitud de personas negras. Para las élites cherokee, poseer esclavos era tanto una fuente de riqueza como una prueba de “civilización” ante Washington.

Ayuso sostuvo que el Partido Popular no contribuirá a lo que considera un proceso de descrédito personal sin resolución judicial y advirtió del daño irreversible que, a su juicio, provocan las acusaciones difundidas antes de que se pronuncien los tribunales.

El 8 de febrero de 1937, tras la caída de Málaga en manos de las tropas sublevadas, una enorme columna de civiles —entre 150.000 y 300.000 personas— huyó por la carretera costera hacia Almería. Durante la huida, fueron atacados desde el aire y el mar, provocando entre 3.000 y 5.000 muertes, lo que convierte este suceso en una de las mayores masacres del conflicto.

El texto se centra especialmente en el uso propagandístico de la fotografía durante y después de estos hechos. Explica cómo el bando sublevado intentó ocultar la masacre mediante la manipulación de la información y el uso engañoso de imágenes publicadas en la prensa de la época, como en el diario ABC de Sevilla.

Las municiones de racimo están prohibidas por la Convención sobre Municiones en Racimo debido a su elevado impacto sobre la población civil, ya que dispersan submuniciones que con frecuencia no explotan y permanecen activas durante años.

A pesar de la creciente vigilancia israelí y los peligros que implica saltar el muro, muchos se ven obligados a hacerlo para subsistir, pues la situación económica en Cisjordania se ha vuelto insostenible.

Lluvias persistentes, nieve, viento y crecidas de ríos obligan a animales de muy distintas especies a tomar decisiones rápidas para sobrevivir, con un alto coste energético y riesgos reales de mortalidad. La supervivencia, según explican expertos en comportamiento animal y veterinaria, se basa principalmente en tres estrategias: buscar refugio adecuado, conservar el calor corporal y, cuando es posible, desplazarse a zonas menos castigadas.

En mamíferos terrestres, el principal peligro es la humedad prolongada. Un pelaje mojado pierde capacidad aislante, aumenta el estrés fisiológico y debilita el sistema inmune, facilitando infecciones y reduciendo la capacidad de reacción. Las madrigueras, que normalmente actúan como refugio seguro, pueden convertirse en trampas mortales si se inundan por la subida del nivel freático o la escorrentía.

Fuentes gubernamentales aseguran que desconocían inicialmente el desplazamiento y recalcan que Zapatero no ostenta cargo público alguno, por lo que sus movimientos en Caracas no corresponden al ámbito de actuación del Gobierno. La posición oficial se resume en una idea clara: se trata de una iniciativa privada y ajena a la política exterior del Estado.

El viaje coincide con un momento políticamente sensible en Venezuela, marcado por la aprobación de una Ley de Amnistía impulsada por el oficialismo, que ha dado lugar a excarcelaciones y revisiones de causas judiciales, algunas de ellas relacionadas con ciudadanos españoles o con doble nacionalidad.

Según los correos electrónicos incorporados a los archivos, Epstein describió aquel encuentro como una cena 'salvaje' y llegó a compartir la imagen con varios contactos personales.

En la charla titulada 'Una conversación honesta sobre la IA y la Humanidad', junto a la neurocientífica Irene Tracey, Harari presentó la inteligencia artificial no como una mera herramienta, sino como un agente autónomo capaz de tomar decisiones, aprender y evolucionar, comparándola con mercenarios sajones que traicionaron a los britanos en el siglo V. Destacó especialmente una supuesta 'exclusiva': que las IAs han acuñado por sí mismas el término 'The Watchers' (Los Observadores) para referirse a los humanos, invirtiendo los roles de vigilantes y vigilados, lo que generó temor entre los asistentes.

La niña pidió en varias ocasiones que la bloqueara, pero él insistió en que disimulara ante sus padres. El abuelo materno descubrió los mensajes, ya que la foto de perfil del contacto era de un adulto, y decidió continuar la conversación haciéndose pasar por su nieta.

El reportaje de EL PAÍS analiza cómo este fenómeno genera una creciente inseguridad vital entre mayores de 45 años que no han podido acceder a la vivienda en propiedad y afrontan su futuro con incertidumbre.

Casos como el de Ramón Bultó, de 57 años, o Iván Aranda, de 46, reflejan una realidad cada vez más común: salarios relativamente estables que no garantizan seguridad residencial a largo plazo. La imposibilidad de ahorrar para la entrada de una hipoteca, el encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y la escasez de oferta empujan a muchos a asumir contratos frágiles y caros, sin la tranquilidad que tradicionalmente aportaba la propiedad como “plan de pensiones”.

El documental de HBO Max *Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!*, dirigido por Judd Apatow y Mike Bonfiglio, repasa la trayectoria de un creador incansable que nunca ha contemplado la jubilación. Actor, guionista, director, productor y compositor, Brooks convirtió el humor en una herramienta política y cultural, capaz de ridiculizar el poder y desafiar los tabúes.

Nacido como Melvin Kaminsky en Brooklyn, creció marcado por la muerte temprana de su padre y por una infancia de burlas y precariedad. Esa mezcla de rabia y vulnerabilidad se transformó en su combustible creativo. Sus primeros pasos en la televisión, especialmente en *Your Show of Shows* junto a Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon o Woody Allen, lo situaron en el epicentro del nacimiento del humor televisivo estadounidense.

Esta medida, tras una reunión mantenida con el experto, podría recaudar más de 5.200 millones de euros anuales según estimaciones del Observatorio Fiscal de la Unión Europea. El objetivo principal es destinar estos fondos a una prestación universal por crianza que permita erradicar la pobreza infantil en el país, un problema que el ministro califica de persistente y con niveles muy altos. Bustinduy ha resaltado el potencial impacto social de la iniciativa y la necesidad de recuperar el control democrático sobre aspectos económicos clave. Entre los afectados estarían destacados empresarios españoles: Amancio Ortega (fundador de Inditex), con un patrimonio estimado en 2025 de 109.900 millones de euros, pagaría alrededo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bustinduy-propone-un-impuesto-del-2-a-fortunas-superiores-a-100-millones-para-financiar-una-prestacion-universal-contra-la-pobreza-infantil</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bustinduy-propone-un-impuesto-del-2-a-fortunas-superiores-a-100-millones-para-financiar-una-prestacion-universal-contra-la-pobreza-infantil</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 13:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xuanyi Geng, de 8 años, bate récords mundiales en el cubo de Rubik 3x3x3]]></title><description><![CDATA[En el Beijing Winter 2026, celebrado el 11 de enero en Pekín, Xuanyi Geng, un prodigio chino de tan solo 8 años, estableció dos nuevos récords mundiales en el cubo de Rubik 3x3x3. Por un lado, logró el récord del mejor promedio resolviendo cinco cubos con un tiempo de 3,84 segundos, y por otro, el récord del cubo individual más rápido con 3,05 segundos. Este logro es especialmente notable porque el récord de promedio es considerado más difícil que el de un solo cubo, ya que requiere constancia y precisión en múltiples intentos. Xuanyi utilizó un método avanzado llamado ZV, creado en 2003, que exige memorizar cerca de 800 algoritmos, algo que hasta ahora parecía impracticable para establecer récords mundiales. Durante la competición, sus tiempos fueron progresando de 5,09 s a 3,37 s en su quinto intento, asegurando la media ganadora. Además de su destreza técnica, el joven aplicó trucos de manipulación con sus dedos, perfeccionados por él mismo.

Tras la breve gestión de Sean Duffy como administrador interino y la llegada de Jared Isaacman al cargo, la agencia presiona para acelerar el alunizaje tripulado y evitar que China adelante en la carrera lunar. Artemis III se mantiene prevista para 2028, pero depende del éxito del Human Landing System (HLS) de SpaceX basado en Starship, que requiere una prueba no tripulada en 2027 y demostrar trasvase orbital de propelentes.

Elon Musk ha decidido posponer indefinidamente los ambiciosos planes marcianos (inicialmente cinco Starships en 2026) para centrarse en la Luna, según anuncios recientes a inversores, donde menciona una prueba HLS en marzo de 2027. Starship tuvo complicaciones en 2025, pero la versión v3 podría cambiar el rumbo.

Desde finales de enero, camina cada día 32 kilómetros entre su casa en Troarn y su centro educativo en Caen, en la región de Normandía. En total, dedica más de seis horas diarias a recorrer el camino de ida y vuelta, enfrentándose al frío, la lluvia y la oscuridad propias del invierno, con el objetivo de recaudar fondos para mejorar el acceso a la educación de niños que viven en zonas aisladas.

La iniciativa, titulada “480 km para aprender”, nació a partir de una reflexión cotidiana compartida con sus compañeros de clase. Mathis tomó conciencia de que muchas de las quejas habituales sobre madrugar o los trayectos largos contrastan con la realidad de miles de menores en el mundo que recorren grandes distancias para poder ir a la escuela, o que directamente no pueden hacerlo.

Así nació iLovePDF, inicialmente como un proyecto personal que compaginaba con su trabajo de diseño web autónomo. Lo que empezó resolviendo problemas básicos como unir, dividir o copiar contenido de PDFs se convirtió rápidamente en una solución popular por su simplicidad, calidad y gratuidad. En 2014 pasó a dedicarse a tiempo completo, en 2017 abrió oficina y contrató equipo, y actualmente cuenta con 43 empleados.

Mientras formaciones como PSOE, Vox, Podemos, Sumar, PNV o ERC cuentan con protocolos (algunos desde hace años y otros actualizados recientemente), el PP se ampara en su Código Ético y de Conducta, que menciona el acoso de forma genérica pero no detalla procedimientos específicos ni se ajusta plenamente a la normativa vigente.

Según la propia compañía, la incautación se habría producido sin que mediara una orden judicial previa, un hecho que ha generado críticas y dudas legales tanto por parte de la empresa como de usuarios y analistas del sector.

Windscribe ha explicado que el servidor afectado opera bajo una arquitectura “RAM-only”, es decir, no utiliza discos duros ni sistemas de almacenamiento persistente. Toda la información se ejecuta exclusivamente en memoria volátil, lo que implica que, al apagar o desconectar el equipo, los datos desaparecen automáticamente. Además, la empresa mantiene una política estricta de no guardar registros de actividad ni información identificable de sus usuarios, por lo que sostiene que el hardware incautado no contiene datos útiles desde el punto de vista de la investigación.

Las críticas principales se centran en la ausencia de un compromiso explícito con la suficiencia financiera, incumpliendo acuerdos previos y la meta del 1% del PIB para universidades públicas, lo que agrava la infrafinanciación denunciada desde 2024 y 2025 (incluyendo deudas de 50 millones de euros).

Tellado subrayó la importancia de la participación de Quiles en los actos del partido, recordando que el joven estuvo vinculado a la formación de Alvise Pérez, Se acabó la fiesta (SALF), antes de colaborar con el PP en varios eventos de campaña. 

Tellado estableció una comparación entre Quiles y el presentador televisivo El Gran Wyoming, argumentando que lo único que hace el primero es 'preguntar con un micrófono', algo que, según él, también hacía el comunicador en su programa 'Caiga quien caiga'.

El texto se centra en explicar un repunte previo y un posterior desplome del déficit, poniendo el foco en las decisiones tomadas por los importadores estadounidenses ante la inminente entrada en vigor de nuevos aranceles. Según se expone, muchas empresas optaron por adelantar compras y acumular inventarios de todo tipo de productos para esquivar el encarecimiento futuro derivado de las medidas proteccionistas, lo que provocó un aumento artificial de las importaciones en un primer momento.

Posteriormente, una vez aplicados los aranceles, las importaciones se redujeron de forma notable, contribuyendo a un aparente reequilibrio de la balanza comercial.

Esta información altamente sensible fue comunicada a la directora de Inteligencia Nacional (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard, quien, en lugar de permitir su distribución rutinaria entre agencias, llevó una copia en papel directamente a la jefa de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, Susie Wiles. Al día siguiente, ordenó a la NSA no publicar el informe y que los detalles clasificados se enviaran exclusivamente a su oficina.

Según la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, los cambios introducidos en la Ley de Acompañamiento de la Comunidad Valenciana suponen una restricción grave de los derechos de las personas LGTBI+ y generan una desigualdad territorial incompatible con la Constitución. El Ejecutivo considera inaceptable que los ciudadanos valencianos tengan menos derechos y libertades que el resto de la población en España.

La reforma, aprobada en mayo para garantizar el respaldo de Vox a los presupuestos autonómicos, incluye enmiendas que eliminan derechos previamente consolidados. Entre las medidas más polémicas figuran la apertura a las denominadas terapias de conversión, prohibidas en España desde la aprobación de la Ley trans estatal en 2023; la limitación del tratamiento de la diversidad sexual y de género en los centros e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-impugna-ante-el-constitucional-los-recortes-a-los-derechos-lgtbi-en-la-ley-trans-valenciana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-impugna-ante-el-constitucional-los-recortes-a-los-derechos-lgtbi-en-la-ley-trans-valenciana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 04:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Escándalo en Alicante: cargos del PP acceden a viviendas protegidas mientras crece la lista de espera en la Comunitat Valenciana]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia destapa un caso polémico en Alicante donde varios cargos públicos y familiares vinculados al Partido Popular (PP) —como la exconcejala de Urbanismo Rocío Gómez, los hijos y un sobrino de la exdirectora general María Pérez-Hickman, y un arquitecto municipal— obtuvieron viviendas de protección pública (VPO o VPP) en una promoción privada sobre suelo vendido por el Ayuntamiento. Estas viviendas, en una zona cotizada como la Playa de San Juan, se adjudicaron sin los controles previos que existían antes de las reformas normativas impulsadas por el Gobierno valenciano de Carlos Mazón en 2024, que eliminaron la obligatoriedad de inscripción en el registro autonómico para promociones privadas y otros requisitos para prevenir fraudes.

Este hecho contrasta con la grave emergencia habitacional en la Comunitat Valenciana: el registro de demandantes de vivienda protegida se multiplicó por seis en tres años, pasando de unos 13.600 a finales de 2022 a 76.475 unidades de convivencia activa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 03:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un documental recoge testimonios sobre el deterioro de la sanidad pública andaluza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El documental “Salud No Responde”, dirigido por Pablo Coca e impulsado por el movimiento Marea Blanca, ofrece una radiografía del estado actual de la sanidad pública en Andalucía a través de testimonios directos de pacientes, profesionales sanitarios y activistas. A lo largo de más de una hora, la película recorre distintas provincias andaluzas, desde Jaén hasta Huelva, mostrando situaciones que se repiten en todo el territorio: listas de espera prolongadas, diagnósticos tardíos, cierre o traslado de servicios, falta de personal y un creciente desgaste físico y emocional entre los trabajadores del sistema sanitario.

La obra evita una narración institucional o distante y opta por que sean los propios protagonistas quienes construyan el relato.

Lejos de depender exclusivamente de decisiones políticas o de la agenda climática, el despliegue de las energías limpias se ha convertido en un fenómeno estructural, impulsado por factores económicos, tecnológicos y financieros.

Según datos de BloombergNEF, en 2025 la inversión mundial en transición energética alcanzó un récord histórico de 2,3 billones de dólares, un 8% más que el año anterior, incluso en un contexto de tensiones geopolíticas, incertidumbre regulatoria y giros políticos adversos en Estados Unidos. Por segundo año consecutivo, la inversión en energías limpias superó a la destinada a combustibles fósiles, mientras que esta última cayó por primera vez desde 2020.

Este patrón meteorológico se debe a un debilitamiento del vórtice polar, una gran masa de aire frío sobre el Ártico que, al perder fuerza, provoca ondulaciones en la corriente en chorro. Estas ondulaciones, junto con un potente anticiclón situado entre Groenlandia e Islandia, actúan como un bloqueo que impide el paso habitual de los frentes por el norte de Europa y los desvía hacia latitudes más bajas, afectando directamente al sur de la península ibérica.

Estudios científicos, como los de la Universidad de Lisboa y la Unión Geofísica Americana, relacionan estos bloqueos en el Atlántico norte con un aumento de días húmedos en el suroeste de Europa, incluida España.

Aunque Hurd sigue estando por detrás del kernel Linux en términos de madurez y soporte de hardware, el panorama actual es más optimista que en años anteriores. Uno de los hitos más relevantes es la finalización práctica del puerto a x86_64, superando su tradicional limitación a arquitecturas de 32 bits. Además, el soporte SMP para sistemas multinúcleo, una carencia histórica del proyecto, ha mejorado de forma notable.

Otro aspecto clave es el progreso en controladores de hardware, impulsado en gran medida por el uso de la capa rump de NetBSD, que ha permitido reutilizar drivers existentes y ampliar la compatibilidad sin partir de cero.

En enero, el sistema eléctrico registró un sobrecoste de unos 105 millones de euros respecto al mismo mes del año anterior, elevando el gasto total en restricciones técnicas hasta los 335 millones. Este incremento está directamente relacionado con las medidas adoptadas tras el apagón de abril de 2025 para reforzar la seguridad del suministro y evitar nuevos episodios de tensión en la red.

El Gobierno, con el aval de la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), permitió a Red Eléctrica mantener durante un año ajustes operativos que inicialmente iban a ser temporales.

Para evitar cualquier tipo de estigmatización, la institución decidió abrir formalmente el dispositivo a todo el alumnado, independientemente de su género, basándolo en un principio de confianza.

Sin embargo, en los meses siguientes, el profesorado detectó un elevado número de ausencias injustificadas entre estudiantes varones de la escuela de ingeniería Ensil-Ensci. La investigación interna reveló que alrededor de cincuenta estudiantes hombres habían utilizado este permiso, acumulando cerca de cien días de ausencia en apenas tres meses.

La compañía invirtió decenas de millones de dólares en adquirir libros usados, principalmente de librerías de segunda mano y bibliotecas, cortándoles el lomo con máquinas hidráulicas, digitalizando sus páginas a alta velocidad y reciclando posteriormente los volúmenes físicos. Este método se presentó como una alternativa más ética a la descarga masiva de copias piratas desde sitios como LibGen, práctica que la propia empresa y otras como Meta, Google y OpenAI habían utilizado anteriormente, aunque con preocupaciones internas sobre su legalidad.

Según el texto, Epstein le confiesa a Peter Thiel que 'representa a los Rothschild' y busca invertir fondos bancarios en Palantir. Se menciona un contrato de 25 millones de dólares, conversaciones con Ariane de Rothschild (CEO del Grupo Edmond de Rothschild) sobre oportunidades tras el golpe en Ucrania en 2014, y sugerencias racistas de Epstein para excluir africanos de consejos asesores. Además, se vincula a Epstein con el Mossad y estrategias geopolíticas en Oriente Medio, como crear enemigos en varios países o supuesta ayuda estadounidense al ISIS.

Estos grupos comparten la explotación de los malestares de los jóvenes varones en un contexto de precariedad económica, crisis de vivienda y dificultades para emanciparse, cruzados con cambios en los roles de género impulsados por el feminismo. Alabao explica que estas comunidades ofrecen respuestas simplistas que culpan al feminismo y a las mujeres, proporcionando además un sentido de pertenencia. Destaca la brecha de género en las preferencias políticas: los jóvenes varones muestran mayor apoyo a derechas radicales y rechazo al feminismo, influido por el consumo masivo de contenido antifeminista online, el aislamiento post-pandemia y la falta de modelos alternativos de masculinidad.

Ya’alon cita al filósofo Yeshayahu Leibowitz, quien en los años 80 advirtió sobre la posibilidad de que la ocupación de 1967 convirtiera a los israelíes en 'judeo-nazis'. Ya’alon reconoce que, en su momento, no comprendió plenamente estas advertencias y ahora admite que Leibowitz tenía razón.

La magistrada considera probado que el demandado publicó más de un centenar de tuits dirigidos a los padres, en los que utilizó expresiones claramente insultantes y vejatorias, calificándolos con numerosos descalificativos. Además, difundió afirmaciones sobre las circunstancias de la muerte de Kira cuya veracidad no quedó acreditada durante el procedimiento judicial.

El problema no se limita a una mala racha coyuntural, sino que responde a un modelo industrial altamente concentrado y dominado por grandes corporaciones.

Según estimaciones del propio sector, las pérdidas de los productores superan los 17.000 millones de dólares, pese a que algunos cortes de carne han subido hasta un 16 % y, en determinados periodos, incluso un 70 % en apenas unos meses. Esta subida no repercute en los ingresos de los criadores, que venden su ganado a precios cada vez más bajos.

Su intervención no será presencial, sino a través de una videollamada, en un acto que reunirá a diversas figuras vinculadas a la derecha y la ultraderecha internacional, entre ellas el presidente argentino Javier Milei.

La participación de Ayuso se produce en un contexto político especialmente delicado en Estados Unidos, marcado por la publicación de nueva información relacionada con los archivos del pederasta Jeffrey Epstein, que vuelven a salpicar directamente a Trump.

Tras fracasar la vía diplomática para convencer a Reino Unido de mantener sus tropas, la inteligencia militar israelí (Aman), bajo el mando del coronel Binyamin Gibli, lanzó en 1954 la Operación Susannah. Esta consistió en una operación de falsa bandera: agentes reclutados en la Unidad 131, compuesta mayoritariamente por judíos egipcios, colocaron bombas de baja potencia en objetivos británicos y estadounidenses en El Cairo y Alejandría (oficinas postales, bibliotecas estadounidenses y teatros), con el fin de simular inestabilidad y atribuir los atentados a grupos como los Hermanos Musulmanes o comunistas, presionando así a los británicos para no evacuar la zona.

Los artefactos eran rudimentarios (bolsas de ácido que corroían y detonaban nitroglicerina), y causaron daños mínimos.

Estas impresionantes obras fueron creadas por los artistas alemanes Leopold Blaschka (1822-1895) y su hijo Rudolf Blaschka (1857-1939), expertos vidrieros que trabajaron durante más de cincuenta años, desde 1886 hasta 1936. En total, produjeron 4.300 modelos de vidrio que representan con gran precisión científica 780 especies de plantas, exclusivamente para Harvard.

La colección fue encargada por el profesor George Lincoln Goodale, director fundador del Museo Botánico de la universidad, y financiada por las benefactoras Mary Lee Ware y su madre Elizabeth. El objetivo principal era disponer de modelos tridimensionales duraderos y de color estable para la enseñanza de la botánica, en una época en la que preservar plantas reales resultaba complicado.

La publicación generó una fuerte polémica e indignación tanto de demócratas como de republicanos, incluido el senador Tim Scott, quien lo calificó como 'lo más racista que he visto en esta Casa Blanca' y pidió su eliminación inmediata. Inicialmente, la secretaria de prensa Karoline Leavitt defendió el contenido, argumentando que se trataba de un meme de internet inspirado en 'El Rey León' —con Trump como rey de la jungla— y tachó de 'falsa indignación' las críticas. Horas después, la Casa Blanca eliminó el video, atribuyendo la publicación a un 'error' de un miembro del personal no identificado.

Esta tendencia confirma que, pese a los compromisos climáticos asumidos en las últimas décadas, las emisiones globales de CO₂ continúan siendo demasiado elevadas como para frenar su acumulación en la atmósfera.

El CO₂ es el principal gas de efecto invernadero generado por la actividad humana y el mayor responsable del calentamiento global actual. Las mediciones realizadas en estaciones de referencia como el Observatorio de Mauna Loa, que registra datos desde 1958, muestran un aumento constante y sostenido de su concentración, impulsado sobre todo por la quema de combustibles fósiles, la industria y el uso intensivo de energía.

Lejos de ser simples curiosidades, estos problemas marcaron el desarrollo de la física moderna al obligar a revisar conceptos como entropía, irreversibilidad, información y tiempo.

El texto comienza con el demonio de Maxwell, un experimento mental que parecía permitir la violación de la segunda ley al crear orden sin gasto de energía. La resolución llegó al comprender que la información es física: medir, almacenar y borrar datos tiene un coste energético inevitable, formulado en el límite de Landauer. Al incluir al observador en el sistema, la entropía total vuelve a aumentar.

A continuación se aborda la paradoja de Loschmidt, que cuestiona por qué el tiempo tiene una dirección si las leyes microscópicas son reversibles.

El autor sostiene que el PP ha actuado con hipocresía al acusar al PSOE de encubrir comportamientos reprobables mientras, al mismo tiempo, niega, minimiza o desacredita las denuncias cuando los señalados pertenecen a su partido.

El texto se centra especialmente en el caso del alcalde de Móstoles, figura cercana a Ayuso, acusado por una concejala de acoso sexual y laboral. Según el columnista, la respuesta del PP madrileño ha sido negar los hechos y amenazar judicialmente a la presunta víctima, una actitud que considera coherente con una estrategia histórica del partido: negar cualquier irregularidad, presentar las acusaciones como conspiraciones políticas y atacar a quien denuncia.

Lejos del discurso polarizado que domina el debate público, Martín defiende una aproximación pragmática basada en la experiencia directa, la gestión técnica y el reconocimiento de que el lobo forma parte del ecosistema. En su explotación sufre ataques frecuentes, con una media de quince caballos muertos al año, pero asegura que, con medidas adecuadas y compensaciones ágiles, la convivencia es posible.

El ganadero destaca que la regulación y el pago de indemnizaciones han mejorado notablemente en los últimos años, reduciendo la sensación de abandono que históricamente sufría el sector.

La propuesta busca acelerar su entrada en vigor y va más allá del mínimo exigido por la Unión Europea, introduciendo la reparabilidad como un elemento clave de la calidad esperable de un producto. En la práctica, si un bien no puede repararse, podría considerarse defectuoso, lo que supone un cambio relevante en la forma de entender la protección al consumidor.

Uno de los puntos centrales del borrador es el incentivo directo a la reparación frente a la sustitución. Los consumidores podrán elegir entre reparar o reemplazar un producto averiado, pero solo la opción de reparar conllevará una ampliación de los derechos de garantía. Concretamente, Alemania plantea extender un año adicional el plazo de reclamación si el usuario opta por arreglar el producto en lugar de cambiarlo por uno nuevo.

El protagonista, Eduardo Colina, alférez joven y abogado de formación, encarna esa posición intermedia entre la vida civil y el conflicto armado. Lejos de cualquier heroicidad, su mirada atenta a los detalles cotidianos —los gestos repetidos, los sonidos, los olores, las texturas— convierte la novela en una exploración del tiempo ordinario.

El punto de partida es el archivo British Cartoon Archive de la Universidad de Kent, que conserva 159 registros de viñetas etiquetadas con el nombre de Franco. Tras un proceso de depuración que elimina duplicidades, versiones repetidas y dibujos con menciones meramente anecdóticas, el autor del artículo identifica un total de 62 caricaturas en las que Franco aparece representado de forma directa y satírica.

El texto sostiene que estos archivos confirmarían antiguas teorías conspirativas y vincula a Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea, la OTAN y diversos gobiernos con una estructura criminal organizada.

El artículo centra parte de sus acusaciones en Kosovo, afirmando que grupos albaneses habrían actuado como intermediarios en el tráfico masivo de niños para satisfacer a élites occidentales, con el respaldo de la OTAN. También se mencionan supuestos casos históricos, como la sustracción de órganos durante la guerra de Yugoslavia, y se citan testimonios no verificados procedentes de fuentes rusas sobre crímenes similares en Ucrania.

Según el contenido de la misiva, Rodríguez defendió la actuación del Ejecutivo regional y negó que los conocidos como ‘protocolos de la vergüenza’ discriminaran a los mayores por razones ajenas a su situación clínica.

El artículo contextualiza estas cartas en un marco más amplio de denuncias y testimonios de familiares que relatan desprecios institucionales, falta de respuestas y una gestión que consideran injusta y dolorosa. Se recuerda que dichos protocolos impidieron el traslado hospitalario de 7.291 personas mayores desde residencias madrileñas, un hecho que ha marcado profundamente a las víctimas y que sigue siendo objeto de controversi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miguel-angel-rodriguez-responsabilizo-por-escrito-al-gobierno-central-de-la-gestion-de-las-residencias-durante-la-pandemia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miguel-angel-rodriguez-responsabilizo-por-escrito-al-gobierno-central-de-la-gestion-de-las-residencias-durante-la-pandemia</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 11:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guía completa para desactivar las funciones de inteligencia artificial en Windows 11 sin herramientas externas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza de forma detallada cómo desactivar o eliminar hasta 13 funciones de inteligencia artificial integradas en Windows 11 utilizando únicamente herramientas y opciones oficiales del propio sistema.

La autora parte de la divulgación por parte de la Comunidad de Madrid de datos privados de una exconcejal de Móstoles que denunció a su alcalde por acoso sexual, y la compara con la rápida condena judicial al Fiscal General del Estado por un caso similar de revelación de secretos relacionado con el entorno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso. A partir de ahí, cuestiona la falta de coherencia de actores como Manos Limpias o el Colegio de Abogados de Madrid, muy diligentes en unos casos y silenciosos en otros.

La medida llega tras los problemas de navegación sufridos durante el conflicto de junio de 2025, cuando se registraron fallos generalizados en las señales de posicionamiento que afectaron tanto a la aviación civil como a los activos militares iraníes. Este episodio puso de relieve la vulnerabilidad de depender de un sistema gestionado por una potencia rival.

BeiDou, operativo a escala global desde 2020, cuenta con una constelación de más de 50 satélites, frente a los aproximadamente 31 del GPS estadounidense. Esta mayor densidad, unida a una arquitectura que incluye satélites en órbitas geoestacionarias, ofrece una cobertura especialmente robusta en Asia y Oriente Medio, lo que resulta ventajoso para un país con una geografía compleja como Irán.

Según su testimonio, la propuesta se hizo de forma preventiva, con el objetivo de “curarse en salud” ante la evolución de los acontecimientos.

Martín Moratilla ha explicado que, una vez que el Centro de Coordinación Operativa Integrado (Cecopi) tuvo conocimiento del riesgo existente en la presa de Forata, se llegó a valorar la evacuación de los municipios potencialmente afectados.

La joven fue detenida y deportada durante las vacaciones de Acción de Gracias, vulnerando una orden judicial que prohibía tanto su traslado fuera de Massachusetts como su expulsión del país.

Tras conocerse la deportación, el juez federal Richard G. Stearns calificó lo ocurrido como un error y dio al Gobierno la oportunidad de corregir la situación. En ese contexto, recomendó que se facilitara el regreso de la estudiante mediante la concesión de un visado de estudiante, con el objetivo de restablecer la situación previa a su expulsión y permitirle continuar con sus estudios universitarios.

El episodio se produjo en un contexto general festivo y animado, marcado por actuaciones musicales y una cuidada puesta en escena que buscaba reflejar tanto la vida urbana de Milán como el entorno montañoso de los Alpes italianos.

Los abucheos se escucharon principalmente al inicio del desfile de la delegación israelí en el estadio de Milán, aunque quedaron rápidamente amortiguados por la música ambiental de alto volumen. Los atletas, encabezados por la abanderada Mariia Seniuk, mantuvieron una actitud serena y continuaron su recorrido con la bandera nacional en alto. En otros escenarios paralelos, como Cortina d’Ampezzo y Predazzo, la recepción fue desigual: algunos aplausos en el primer caso y nuevos abucheos aislados en el segundo.

Enero cerró con una media de 119 litros por metro cuadrado, un 85% más de lo normal, convirtiéndose en el enero más lluvioso en 25 años. Este encadenamiento de temporales, que ha provocado evacuaciones, inundaciones y graves problemas de infraestructuras, está relacionado con cambios en la circulación atmosférica a gran escala.

Los meteorólogos apuntan a la corriente en chorro —un potente flujo de aire que rodea el hemisferio norte— como elemento clave para entender la situación. Habitualmente, esta corriente guía las borrascas atlánticas por latitudes más septentrionales, afectando sobre todo al norte de Europa. Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas se ha desplazado hacia el sur debido a un patrón atmosférico anómalo, con el anticiclón de las Azores situado mucho más al norte de lo habitual, entre Groenlandi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El gran problema del feminismo, Denuncias falsas de maltrato, Jóvenes fachas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo parece ser un debate o discusión sobre temas relacionados con el feminismo, con un enfoque en las denuncias falsas de maltrato y la aparición de movimientos juveniles con ideologías conservadoras.

En su intervención, Sánchez señaló que la actitud del PP en estos comicios refleja una clara alianza con la ultraderecha, dado que Quiles estuvo en la lista electoral de Alvise Pérez y Los Meconios han apoyado campañas de Vox.

La delegación de Estados Unidos, encabezada por la patinadora de velocidad Erin Jackson como abanderada, recibió una acogida calurosa por parte del público italiano cuando desfiló por el estadio de San Siro. Sin embargo, el ambiente cambió de forma notable cuando las cámaras enfocaron al vicepresidente estadounidense, J.D. Vance, presente en la tribuna junto a su esposa, la segunda dama Usha Vance.

En ese momento se escucharon abucheos y silbidos procedentes de parte de los asistentes, a pesar de que los atletas estadounidenses habían sido ovacionados instantes antes.

Partiendo de una referencia literaria a *La naranja mecánica* de Anthony Burgess —incluido un reconocimiento explícito de un error inicial atribuyéndola a Aldous Huxley—, el autor utiliza la metáfora de aceptar o escupir un mensaje para introducir su tesis central: durante años, el establishment ha negado que el feminismo señalara realidades estructurales, reduciendo las desigualdades a cuestiones biológicas o individuales.

El texto aporta ejemplos contemporáneos que refuerzan esa crítica. Uno de los más destacados es el uso de servicios de inteligencia artificial para generar desnudos cosificadores en redes sociales, donde los datos muestran que la inmensa mayoría de solicitudes provienen de hombres y están dirigidas a mujeres.

A diferencia de sistemas anteriores centrados en la defensa costera del Golfo Pérsico, el Abu Mahdi introduce una capacidad ofensiva de largo alcance que extiende la amenaza iraní más allá de sus aguas inmediatas. Con un alcance estimado superior a los 1.000 kilómetros, este misil permite a Teherán influir en áreas que hasta ahora se consideraban relativamente seguras para la navegación militar estadounidense.

El Abu Mahdi es un misil de crucero subsónico propulsado por turborreactor, diseñado para vuelos prolongados y perfiles de ataque complejos. Su trayectoria combina fases a gran altitud, que optimizan el consumo de combustible, con un descenso final a vuelo rasante sobre la superficie del mar.

Por un lado, el intento de debilitar el pontificado del papa Francisco, visto como una amenaza ideológica por los sectores más conservadores del catolicismo en Estados Unidos; por otro, la financiación y coordinación de fuerzas populistas y de extrema derecha en Europa con el objetivo de erosionar la Unión Europea desde dentro.

En uno de los mensajes más llamativos, fechado en junio de 2019, Bannon escribe a Epstein que 'derribarán' al papa Francisco, al que equipara con otros grandes enemigos políticos y geoestratégicos como la UE, China o los Clinton.

Las responsables de las protectoras denuncian la ineficacia de la legislación española en cuanto al maltrato animal, ya que el agresor acumulaba varias denuncias sin que se tomaran medidas contundentes. Este caso pone de manifiesto un problema estructural de empatía en la sociedad y la normalización de la violencia hacia los animales, reflejada también en los medios de comunicación. Las activistas insisten en que las leyes deben ser más estrictas y aplicarse con mayor firmeza, ya que quienes son capaces de hacer daño a los animales podrían también hacerlo a las personas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-maltrato-animal-en-roldan-pone-en-evidencia-la-ineficacia-de-las-leyes-de-proteccion-animal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-maltrato-animal-en-roldan-pone-en-evidencia-la-ineficacia-de-las-leyes-de-proteccion-animal</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 03:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alemania debate la prohibición de redes sociales para menores de 16 años]]></title><description><![CDATA[La CDU de Alemania está planteando prohibir el acceso a redes sociales a menores de 16 años, siguiendo una tendencia internacional. Argumentan que las plataformas digitales exponen a los jóvenes a contenido nocivo como el odio y la desinformación, y que los controles actuales son insuficientes. Este debate surge tras las preocupaciones sobre los efectos negativos de las redes sociales en los menores, como el ciberacoso y la violencia. La CDU de Schleswig-Holstein ha propuesto una moción para introducir una verificación obligatoria de edad. Este enfoque no es nuevo, ya que Australia ya tomó medidas similares, y Pedro Sánchez en España también ha mostrado interés en regular el acceso a las redes sociales en la misma línea. Si se aprueba la ley en Alemania, las plataformas deberán bloquear a los menores de 16 años, con posibles sanciones si no cumplen. La propuesta implica redefinir la forma en que se verifica la edad en internet y las responsabilidades de las plataformas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-debate-la-prohibicion-de-redes-sociales-para-menores-de-16-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alemania-debate-la-prohibicion-de-redes-sociales-para-menores-de-16-anos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 02:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orígenes y desarrollo de los Boeing 747 LCF Dreamlifter]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Boeing 747 LCF, conocido como Dreamlifter, es un avión diseñado específicamente para transportar grandes componentes del Boeing 787 Dreamliner, reduciendo drásticamente los tiempos de transporte desde Japón hasta Estados Unidos. A principios de los años 2000, Boeing necesitaba trasladar grandes secciones del 787, fabricadas en colaboración con empresas japonesas e italianas, pero el transporte marítimo era lento y costoso. La solución fue modificar cuatro Boeing 747-400, ampliando su fuselaje central para acomodar estas piezas. El primer avión convertido realizó su vuelo inaugural en 2006 y la certificación por la FAA se obtuvo en 2007. Las cuatro unidades del programa provienen de aviones previamente operados por Air China, China Airlines y Malaysia Airlines, que fueron adquiridos por Boeing y posteriormente transformados por Evergreen International Airlines. Estas aeronaves siguen siendo esenciales para la logística del Dreamliner, y cuentan con equipos especializados, como el DBL]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/origenes-y-desarrollo-de-los-boeing-747-lcf-dreamlifter</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/origenes-y-desarrollo-de-los-boeing-747-lcf-dreamlifter</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 01:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CHA denuncia a una web por incitar odio contra las mujeres y cuestionar sus derechos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Chunta Aragonesista (CHA) ha llevado ante la Fiscalía unos panfletos difundidos en la página web wikiviogen.com, alegando que atentan contra las leyes de igualdad y promueven una cultura del odio hacia las mujeres.

Los intercambios, fechados principalmente entre 2018 y 2019, coinciden con el periodo en el que Bannon, ya fuera de la Casa Blanca, recorrió Europa con la intención de articular un frente ultraderechista y euroescéptico dentro del Parlamento Europeo.

En los mensajes, Bannon se muestra especialmente interesado en líderes como Matteo Salvini, entonces viceprimer ministro italiano y líder de la Liga, y Marine Le Pen en Francia. En uno de los textos, enviado en marzo de 2019, Bannon afirma estar “centrado en recaudar fondos para Le Pen y Salvini” de cara a las elecciones europeas celebradas en mayo de ese año.

Desde distintos niveles del partido, incluidos Alfonso Serrano, número dos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, y otros cargos, se han cuestionado públicamente la labor profesional de la denunciante y su lealtad al partido, llegando incluso a difundir bulos. La exedil había grabado conversaciones internas que evidenciaban que algunos dirigentes desaconsejaban denunciar el acoso y aludían al posible malestar en su familia. A pesar de que el PP cuenta con protocolos para casos de acoso, la respuesta oficial ha sido centrarse en desacreditar a la denunciante, defendiendo la actuación de los cargos implicados y la presunción de inocencia del alcalde.

La grabación, creada con inteligencia artificial, mostraba a Barack Obama y a su esposa, Michelle, con sus rostros superpuestos en cuerpos de monos, una representación ampliamente condenada por reproducir estereotipos racistas históricos. El vídeo formaba parte de una pieza de tono conspiranoico que insistía, sin pruebas, en la supuesta manipulación de las máquinas de votación de Dominion Voting Systems durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2020, en las que Joe Biden derrotó a Trump.

La publicación permaneció visible durante unas doce horas antes de ser retirada, una decisión poco habitual en Trump, que rara vez elimina contenidos polémicos.

El respaldo se ha producido a través de un mensaje publicado en la red social X, en el que Soros elogia el liderazgo de Sánchez y destaca su forma de afrontar los problemas sociales mediante políticas que define como sólidas, pragmáticas y basadas en principios.

En su mensaje, Alexander Soros subraya que, frente a otros dirigentes que eluden los grandes retos, el presidente español opta por abordarlos de manera directa. Concluye su intervención reclamando más líderes electos con ese tipo de enfoque político. Estas declaraciones se producen como reacción a un tuit de Pedro Sánchez en el que compartía un artículo de opinión publicado en The New York Times.

Imágenes de vigilancia revisadas por investigadores muestran una figura de color naranja subiendo por las escaleras hacia el módulo de celdas donde se encontraba Epstein alrededor de las 22:39, contradictorio con los informes oficiales que afirmaban que nadie había entrado en el área esa noche. Mientras que el FBI interpretó la figura como 'posiblemente un recluso', el informe de la Oficina del Inspector General indicó que podría tratarse de un funcionario de prisiones transportando ropa o sábanas. Estas discrepancias han generado debates sobre la cronología de los hechos y la supervisión de los guardias, ya que los registros muestran fallos en los conteos de presos y en los controles de bienestar de Epstein.

En lugar de responder al fondo de la cuestión, Serrano replicó con una frase personal y despectiva —“¿Y tú cómo ligas?”— que desvió el foco del asunto y generó críticas por su tono y falta de respeto.

La pregunta hacía referencia a la denuncia presentada por una exconcejala del Ayuntamiento de Móstoles, que acusa al alcalde de acoso laboral y sexual. Ante este contexto, Serrano no solo evitó valorar los hechos concretos, sino que defendió de manera cerrada a su partido y al regidor municipal. Durante la comparecencia, anunció además posibles acciones legales contra “cualquiera” que acuse al PP de encubrir un caso de acoso sexual, elevando el tono del enfrentamiento político.

En las imágenes, Esteve afirma que irá a buscarlo y que lo enviará al hospital, añadiendo que asumirá las consecuencias y extendiendo la amenaza a cualquier persona del entorno de Iglesias que intente intervenir. El tono y el contenido del mensaje han generado una inmediata reacción política y social.

Pablo Iglesias respondió públicamente denunciando la gravedad de los hechos y señalando que las amenazas proceden, según sus palabras, de alguien al frente de un grupo de 'matones profesionales' con antecedentes por agresiones. Iglesias subrayó que su compromiso antifascista se refuerza ante este tipo de intimidaciones y anunció que presentará una denuncia, al tiempo que reclamó que las autoridades actúen antes de que las amenazas puedan materializarse.

La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha advertido de precipitaciones muy abundantes en comunidades donde el suelo ya se encuentra saturado, lo que aumenta de forma significativa el riesgo de inundaciones y crecidas de ríos.

El contexto atmosférico viene marcado por un chorro polar especialmente activo y desplazado hacia latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, un patrón que está facilitando la llegada continua de borrascas desde el Atlántico. Este flujo dominante de vientos del oeste y suroeste arrastra aire muy húmedo, provocando lluvias persistentes y, en algunos momentos, de carácter intenso.

Desde diciembre, el país no recibe suministros regulares de gasolina y diésel, lo que ha provocado apagones prolongados, el colapso del transporte público y un aumento generalizado del malestar social. En La Habana, considerada una de las zonas menos afectadas, los cortes eléctricos alcanzan entre 12 y 14 horas diarias, mientras que en el oriente del país algunas provincias apenas disponen de seis horas de electricidad al día.

La falta de combustible ha obligado al Gobierno a racionar la venta de gasolina, que ahora se comercializa exclusivamente en dólares y con un límite estricto de 40 litros por usuario.

Pozuelo de Alarcón, el municipio con mayor renta media de España (alrededor de 89.400 euros por hogar), recibió 93 becas, mientras que Parla, con una renta mucho más baja y mayor población, solo obtuvo 14, es decir, más de seis veces menos. Esta diferencia se explica por factores socioeconómicos: en Pozuelo, el 66% de los jóvenes de 18 a 22 años accede a la universidad, frente al 18% en Parla.

El temor de los concesionarios se produce en un contexto de encarecimiento de los coches nuevos en Estados Unidos y de desaparición de modelos asequibles de los catálogos tradicionales, lo que ha incrementado el interés de parte del público por alternativas más baratas.

En los audios, Nolasco pregunta de forma directa a su entorno de confianza si Azcón aceptaría colocar a personas afines “donde él quisiera”, recibiendo como respuesta que cualquier movimiento sería fruto de una negociación y no de una obediencia automática.

La noticia destaca que, mientras Abascal se presenta como un firme defensor de España, no dudó en mostrar simpatía hacia un magnate extranjero que critica al propio Gobierno español. Los usuarios de Twitter cuestionaron sus motivaciones y le acusaron de intentar ganar notoriedad internacional a costa de criticar a su propio país. La reacción de Abascal fue interpretada por muchos como un gesto de 'lamebotismo' hacia Musk, y varios tuiteros no tardaron en expresar su descontento con comentarios irónicos y críticos. Esta situación vuelve a poner de manifiesto las contradicciones del discurso ultraderechista, que promueve un patriotismo muy marcado pero que, según los críticos, se desdibuja cuando se trata de figuras extranjeras con poder.

El interés norteamericano por ambos territorios se explica por razones estratégicas más que económicas, especialmente en el contexto de la Primera Guerra Mundial y la reciente apertura del Canal de Panamá, que incrementó el valor geopolítico del Caribe.

Las Islas Vírgenes, colonizadas sucesivamente por varias potencias europeas, pasaron a manos danesas en el siglo XVII y se integraron en un sistema colonial basado en plantaciones de azúcar sostenidas por mano de obra esclava. Tras la abolición de la esclavitud y el hundimiento de ese modelo económico, el archipiélago se convirtió en una carga para Dinamarca. Estados Unidos mostró interés desde mediados del siglo XIX, temiendo que otras potencias europeas, especialmente Alemania, se adelantaran en su control.

Su valor no reside únicamente en la antigüedad, sino en la continuidad y homogeneidad de sus datos, que permiten comparar años y detectar patrones y cambios climáticos con una sólida base documental.

El Calendario Meteorológico se publica anualmente y no responde al formato de un calendario convencional. Se trata de una obra técnica con vocación tanto científica como divulgativa, que recoge los principales datos climáticos del año agrícola anterior, comprendido entre septiembre y agosto.

Ambos son señalados por haber intentado, en 2024, minimizar los hechos y disuadir a la víctima de acudir a los tribunales.

Según la información publicada, la concejala trasladó en varias ocasiones al partido su situación y solicitó amparo formal, denunciando tanto el acoso como las represalias laborales posteriores.

Según el análisis, la semana del 9 al 15 de febrero estará marcada por la continuidad de la llegada de borrascas atlánticas, lo que se traducirá en un episodio lluvioso en gran parte de la Península. Galicia será la comunidad más afectada por las precipitaciones, mientras que en el área mediterránea y en los archipiélagos las lluvias serán, en caso de producirse, más débiles y dispersas.

Además de las precipitaciones, esta primera semana destacará por unas temperaturas claramente superiores a la media habitual para esta época del año en la práctica totalidad del territorio peninsular, consolidando una tendencia de ambiente suave que ya se viene observando en semanas anteriores.

La ficción, compuesta por ocho capítulos, aborda de forma cruda y directa el auge de la extrema derecha y sus efectos sobre una democracia debilitada. La historia sigue a Salvador, un médico madrileño que se enfrenta a un drama personal cuando descubre que su hija Milena, gravemente herida en una pelea entre hinchas de fútbol, forma parte de un grupo neonazi llamado White Souls. La serie no solo expone la violencia y la injusticia que rodea a este fenómeno político, sino que también invita al espectador a reflexionar sobre las causas que llevan a personas aparentemente pacíficas a adoptar ideas extremistas. La producción combina escenas de acción trepidantes con un análisis profundo de la polarización social, mostrando cómo el descontento y la frustración pueden ser aprovechados por ideologías radicales.

Desde 2008, la organización ha atendido a más de 10.000 mujeres y niñas mediante un proyecto que combina prevención, acompañamiento y atención integral, así como formación de profesionales sanitarios para la detección temprana de situaciones de riesgo. El proyecto también fomenta redes comunitarias lideradas por mujeres, como Flor de África, y grupos de jóvenes afrodescendientes, fortaleciendo su papel como agentes de cambio. La erradicación de la MGF se considera un desafío que requiere intervención comunitaria, implicación institucional y enfoque en los derechos humanos, incluyendo la reconstrucción genital y atención emocional.

Estudios recientes sobre el Parque Solar de Talatan en la meseta tibetana muestran que la instalación de paneles fotovoltaicos ha creado un microclima que protege el suelo, retiene la humedad, reduce la erosión y favorece la vegetación. Tras más de una década de funcionamiento, se ha observado un aumento del 81,4% en la fijación de arena, del 71,1% en captura de carbono, del 32,1% en retención del suelo y del 5,4% en conservación de agua. Los paneles actúan como barreras contra el viento y sombra para el suelo, permitiendo que las semillas germinen y crezcan donde antes no era posible. Esta restauración genera beneficios ecológicos que incluso se extienden más allá del perímetro de la planta. Sin embargo, los estudios destacan una desigualdad ecológica: las zonas dentro del parque son mucho más fértiles que el desierto circundante. Además, la recuperación d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-parques-solares-pueden-mejorar-la-ecologia-de-los-desiertos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-parques-solares-pueden-mejorar-la-ecologia-de-los-desiertos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 12:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El legado del rock instrumental: de Rick Wakeman a Caitlin De Ville]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo explora el impacto del rock instrumental en la música, desde el icónico trabajo de Rick Wakeman en 'Las seis esposas de Enrique VIII' hasta la propuesta contemporánea de Caitlin De Ville en 'Primal Donna'. Mientras Wakeman llevó al extremo el uso del teclado en el rock progresivo, mostrando la capacidad narrativa de los instrumentos, De Ville ofrece una visión más moderna, utilizando el violín eléctrico para crear una pieza que fusiona riffs y melodías tensas. A través de estos dos ejemplos, se demuestra cómo el rock instrumental ha evolucionado desde su apogeo en los años 70, adaptándose a la era digital y al formato de escucha fragmentada actual, sin perder su esencia ni su poder expresivo. La obra de ambos músicos subraya cómo, al prescindir de la voz, la música instrumental continúa siendo una forma profunda de comunicación que puede ser tanto visual como auditiva.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-rock-instrumental-de-rick-wakeman-a-caitlin-de-ville</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-rock-instrumental-de-rick-wakeman-a-caitlin-de-ville</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 11:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stan Wawrinka anuncia su última temporada y elogia a Carlos Alcaraz como un tenista único e impredecible]]></title><description><![CDATA[Stan Wawrinka, el tenista suizo de 40 años, afronta en 2026 su última temporada como profesional tras una carrera destacada en la que conquistó tres Grand Slams (Australia 2014, Roland Garros 2015 y US Open 2016) en una era dominada por Federer, Nadal y Djokovic.

Sin embargo, diversos expertos advierten que esta medida podría tener consecuencias negativas más allá de la protección de los menores. La prohibición no solo no es eficaz para reducir los riesgos de las redes sociales, sino que podría vulnerar derechos fundamentales como la libertad de expresión, el acceso a la información y la educación. Además, la implementación de sistemas de verificación de edad obligatorios en plataformas en línea amenaza con acabar con el anonimato en Internet, exponiendo a los usuarios adultos a un mayor control y aumentando los riesgos de cibercrimen.

El origen del conflicto está en la ley autonómica que garantiza el mantenimiento del puesto de trabajo de los docentes de religión designados por el obispo, incluso después de que la LOMLOE haya reducido su carga lectiva a una hora semanal. PSN y Contigo/Zurekin han presentado una propuesta para derogar esta norma, al considerar que supone un gasto injustificado y que vulnera los principios de igualdad, mérito y capacidad en el acceso al empleo público.

Geroa Bai, socio clave del Ejecutivo, se ha desmarcado por ahora de esta iniciativa. La coalición reprocha al Departamento de Educación la falta de información detallada sobre el impacto real de una posible derogación, como el número de docentes afectados, su edad, los criterios de despido y el coste de las indemnizaciones.

Las imágenes muestran un grave accidente ocurrido en marzo de 2025 en la provincia china de Yunnan, en el que un sedán eléctrico Dongfeng eπ007 colisionó a gran velocidad con un camión y terminó envuelto en llamas en menos de un minuto.

Tras el impacto, que a simple vista no parece especialmente violento, la batería del vehículo quedó dañada y comenzó a generar humo rápidamente. El conductor logró salir del coche, pero no pudo abrir las puertas traseras para rescatar a los otros ocupantes debido a que los tiradores ocultos no se desplegaban. Peor aún, su propia puerta se cerró de nuevo y dejó de responder. En apenas 29 segundos, el interior del coche ya estaba lleno de humo negro.

La presidenta ha señalado que la tauromaquia vive un “momento especial” en España, destacando el creciente interés de la juventud, a la que atribuye la búsqueda de autenticidad frente a lo que considera intentos de limitar determinadas tradiciones culturales. En este contexto, ha remarcado que el Gobierno regional continuará apoyando y fomentando los festejos taurinos, manteniendo a Madrid como “la gran casa de la tauromaquia” al servicio del conjunto del país.

La investigación combina arquitectura, arqueología naval, lingüística y etnografía. Uno de los puntos de partida es la similitud entre los términos griegos naus (barco) y naos (templo), cuya coincidencia formal habría sido ignorada hasta ahora por falta de una conexión material clara entre ambos conceptos.

Bautista compareció ante los medios defendiendo su continuidad en el cargo y apelando a la presunción de inocencia, asegurando que seguirá trabajando por respeto a los vecinos del municipio.

El regidor sostiene que la denuncia fue investigada internamente por el PP entre octubre de 2024 y abril de 2025 y que el expediente fue archivado al no encontrarse pruebas que acreditaran los hechos. Además, subraya que la exconcejala no recurrió esa decisión ni acudió posteriormente a la vía judicial, argumento que utiliza para afirmar que no sabe de qué debe defenderse.

La investigación, publicada en la revista Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy y desarrollada en el marco de una tesis doctoral, se centra principalmente en el hepatocarcinoma, el cáncer de hígado más frecuente en adultos, aunque también analiza modelos de colangiocarcinoma y cáncer de colon.

Trabajos previos ya habían demostrado que SLU7 es esencial para el correcto funcionamiento de los hepatocitos sanos y que sus niveles disminuyen a medida que progresa la enfermedad hepática. Sin embargo, este nuevo estudio revela una paradoja relevante: aunque SLU7 se reduce durante la evolución de la enfermedad, las células tumorales conservan una cantidad mínima de esta proteína que resulta imprescindible para su supervivencia. A partir de esta observación, los investigadores plantearon que eli]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-inhibicion-de-la-proteina-slu7-frena-el-crecimiento-tumoral-y-potencia-la-respuesta-inmunitaria-en-modelos-preclinicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-inhibicion-de-la-proteina-slu7-frena-el-crecimiento-tumoral-y-potencia-la-respuesta-inmunitaria-en-modelos-preclinicos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 07:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tecnología Primitiva: Soplador con polea portátil]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra a una persona construyendo un soplador funcional utilizando únicamente materiales naturales y técnicas rudimentarias, en este caso, un sistema de poleas creado con elementos encontrados en la naturaleza.

La resolución califica este tipo de delitos como de una vileza excepcional y subraya que, cuando concurran circunstancias especialmente atroces, no se aplicarán reducciones de condena, conmutaciones ni medidas de clemencia.

La decisión se enmarca en una estrategia nacional de tolerancia cero frente a los crímenes cometidos contra menores, que sitúa la integridad física y psicológica de la infancia como un valor prioritario del Estado. Según el comunicado oficial, quienes vulneren de forma grave este principio podrán perder definitivamente la libertad o la vida, en función de la magnitud del daño causado y del contexto del delito.

En este acto, al que invita a estadounidenses de todo el país, se pretende orar, dar gracias y 'volver a consagrar a Estados Unidos como una sola nación bajo Dios', en referencia al Juramento de Lealtad. El anuncio se enmarca en un discurso de hora y media en el que Trump celebró el regreso de la religión tras la pandemia, criticó duramente a los demócratas por supuestamente tratar mal a los creyentes y expulsarlos de la vida pública, y repitió afirmaciones sobre fraude electoral en 2020.

Según explica, miles de ancianos murieron sin ser trasladados a hospitales, no por criterios médicos individualizados, sino por protocolos que excluían a residentes con alta dependencia o deterioro cognitivo.

El jet, un Gulfstream de 16 plazas, fue empleado al menos en dos vuelos recientes, en enero y febrero, trasladando a varios hombres palestinos desde un centro de detención en Arizona hasta Tel Aviv, con escalas técnicas en Estados Unidos y Europa.

Según el reportaje, los deportados viajaron esposados y con grilletes en tobillos y muñecas durante un trayecto de más de 12 horas.

Las grabaciones corresponden a reuniones internas del primer semestre de 2024, en las que se cuestionaba la estrategia impuesta desde Madrid de romper los pactos de gobierno con el Partido Popular en varias comunidades autónomas, incluida Aragón. Entre las voces críticas destacan Ana Pilar González del Cacho, actual jefa de gabinete de la presidenta de las Cortes aragonesas, y Alejandro Nolasco, por entonces vicepresidente del Gobierno autonómico y hoy candidato de Vox. En las conversaciones, González del Cacho llega a afirmar que Abascal 'no tiene ni puta idea' y 'es un puto basto', amenazando incluso con desafiliarse si se mantenía la línea política nacional.

Casos como los de José Juan, funcionario ibicenco, y Dolma Hita, educadora social, ejemplifican cómo ciudadanos nacidos o arraigados en las islas se ven obligados a mudarse a otras regiones de España. José, tras ganar una oposición en Ibiza, tuvo que renunciar a ocupar su plaza porque no podía afrontar los costes de una vivienda local. Dolma, separada y con hijos, tuvo que trasladarse a Villena, Alicante, para poder adquirir una casa a un precio asequible. Según expertos, el 60% del salario familiar se destina al alquiler en Baleares, cifra que supera ampliamente la media nacional y provoca exclusión social y desigualdad.

En algunos correos se evidencia que Bannon viajaba por Europa con la intención de unir a estos grupos en un movimiento euroescéptico. No hay evidencia de que Salvini tuviera relación directa con Epstein ni participación en su red de tráfico sexual, aunque su nombre aparece varias veces en los intercambios.

Esta zona, aislada durante siglos por montañas escarpadas y su estructura de clanes patrilineales, presenta una notable preservación genética única en Europa continental.

Los resultados muestran que alrededor del 80 % de los linajes paternos pertenecen al haplogrupo J-M172 (específicamente subclados como J-L930), común en la antigüedad griega pero poco frecuente en otras partes de Europa actual. Muchos de estos linajes se remontan a un ancestro común del siglo VII a.C., lo que indica episodios graves de reducción demográfica por epidemias, guerras e inestabilidad política a lo largo de la historia.

La sentencia, dictada por la sala de lo contencioso-administrativo, respalda el criterio de la Agencia Tributaria y concluye que el holding del cineasta intentó compensar de forma indebida las pérdidas de una empresa integrada en el grupo, lo que suponía un doble aprovechamiento fiscal no permitido por la normativa.

El caso se remonta a una inspección iniciada en 2013 sobre AE William Holding, conglomerado que agrupa varias sociedades vinculadas a la actividad cinematográfica de Segura, entre ellas Amiguetes Entertainment, productora de la saga Torrente. El conflicto surgió cuando el grupo incorporó una empresa con fuertes pérdidas previas y trató de utilizarlas para reducir su carga fiscal.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las 2:15 de la madrugada y está siendo investigado por la Policía india, que confirmó el fallecimiento de las menores en el lugar de los hechos.

Según las primeras informaciones, las jóvenes se encontraban muy afectadas después de que sus padres les hubieran retirado el teléfono móvil. De acuerdo con la reconstrucción inicial, las hermanas se habrían encerrado en el balcón del domicilio familiar antes de precipitarse al vacío. Los gritos alertaron a los padres y a algunos vecinos del edificio, pero cuando lograron acceder al balcón ya no pudieron evitar el desenlace.

Las autoridades hallaron en la vivienda una nota manuscrita de varias páginas en la que las menores expresaban su fuerte apego a la cultura coreana, especialmente a la música y a las series, así com]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mueren-tres-hermanas-menores-tras-caer-desde-su-vivienda-en-india-en-un-caso-bajo-investigacion-policial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mueren-tres-hermanas-menores-tras-caer-desde-su-vivienda-en-india-en-un-caso-bajo-investigacion-policial</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 23:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las lluvias de la borrasca Leonardo inundan el 26% de Doñana y reactivan la marisma, aunque persisten los problemas del acuífero]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Parque Nacional de Doñana atraviesa uno de sus episodios hídricos más intensos de los últimos años tras el paso de la borrasca Leonardo. Las lluvias han inundado ya el 26% de su superficie total, unas 34.000 hectáreas de las 128.000 que conforman el espacio protegido, con especial incidencia en la marisma, que se encuentra cubierta en un 88%. El nivel del agua ha alcanzado los 1,8 metros sobre el nivel del mar y continúa aumentando a un ritmo acelerado, con previsiones de superar los 1,9 metros en las próximas horas, lo que está unificando grandes áreas en una única lámina de agua de unas 30.000 hectáreas.

Desde el punto de vista ecológico, este episodio tiene efectos mayoritariamente positivos a corto plazo. Las condiciones actuales favorecen especialmente a las aves migratorias e invernantes, cuya presencia casi se ha duplicado respecto al año anterior, así como a anfibios, reptiles y parte de la vegetación característica del humedal.

Utilizando la técnica DIPA-CRISPR, desarrollada previamente por el mismo grupo en 2022 para inactivar genes mediante inyección en el abdomen de la hembra, los investigadores han realizado una inserción (knock-in) fusionando el gen distal-less (clave en el desarrollo embrionario) con el marcador fluorescente rojo mCherry. Esta modificación se ha logrado con éxito en alrededor del 30 % de las hembras inyectadas, permitiendo observar en vivo y en tiempo real la expresión de la proteína Dll en apéndices y sistema nervioso durante el desarrollo embrionario, sin alterar el crecimiento normal del insecto.

Esta megaestructura consiste en un anillo artificial construido alrededor de una estrella, con un radio similar a la órbita terrestre y una superficie habitable millones de veces mayor que la de la Tierra. Aunque la idea fascinó a lectores y científicos, pronto generó críticas técnicas, especialmente tras la publicación de la novela en 1970.

El principal problema señalado es la inestabilidad gravitatoria inherente a un anillo orbital de este tipo. A diferencia de una órbita planetaria, el equilibrio del anillo es inestable: cualquier perturbación mínima —ya sea una asimetría estructural, el impacto de un meteorito o la influencia gravitatoria de otros cuerpos— tendería a crecer hasta provocar la colisión del anillo con la estrella central. Mantenerlo centrado sería tan difícil como equilibrar un lápiz sobre su punta.

Tras alcanzar un máximo histórico en octubre de 2025, cuando llegó a cotizar en torno a los 126.000 dólares impulsado por la victoria electoral de Donald Trump y sus promesas de convertir a Estados Unidos en una potencia mundial del bitcoin, la criptomoneda ha iniciado una tendencia claramente descendente. En la actualidad, su valor ha caído por debajo de los 71.000 dólares, situándose incluso por debajo del precio que tenía antes de que Trump regresara a la presidencia.

Las pérdidas se han acelerado recientemente: un 8% en un solo día, un 20% en una semana y casi la mitad de su valor en el último trimestre.

El asunto fue tratado el pasado 2 de febrero en la Asamblea de Madrid, cuando José Nieves, director de gestión del hospital, compareció a raíz de una pregunta formulada meses antes por la diputada de Más Madrid Marta Carmona.

Según expone el sindicato MATS, la central de esterilización está actualmente gestionada por la empresa Croma Servicios y Productos, tras la externalización del servicio. Diversos documentos internos indicarían que esta empresa estaría esterilizando material de la compañía privada Sanitas utilizando las instalaciones públicas del hospital madrileño. De confirmarse, esto supondría un uso de recursos de la sanidad pública para beneficiar a entidades privadas.

Las acciones se concentraban principalmente en el centro urbano, alrededor de un oratorio islámico y en comercios regentados por personas inmigrantes. Además, los mensajes también se difundían en redes sociales, amplificando su alcance y generando alarma social.

En diciembre, la presidenta madrileña reprochó a la izquierda la falta de contundencia ante acusaciones de acoso, utilizando el caso Salazar para acusar al PSOE de no proteger a las mujeres y de normalizar conductas machistas en su entorno político.

Sin embargo, cuando una edil del PP de Móstoles denunció haber sufrido acoso sexual y laboral por parte del alcalde del municipio, Manuel Bautista, Ayuso no la recibió ni respondió a sus escritos, a pesar de que la concejala intentó durante meses obtener su apoyo. En lugar de ello, la presidenta sí citó al alcalde denunciado pocos días después de conocer los hechos. La concejala terminó solicitando la baja del partido, dejando constancia por escrito de que se le negó amparo y de que sus denuncias fueron ignoradas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ayuso-critico-al-psoe-por-el-caso-salazar-mientras-ignoro-denuncias-internas-de-acoso-en-el-pp-de-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ayuso-critico-al-psoe-por-el-caso-salazar-mientras-ignoro-denuncias-internas-de-acoso-en-el-pp-de-madrid</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 20:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tercera dimisión en la Generalitat por las irregularidades en la adjudicación de viviendas públicas en Alicante]]></title><description><![CDATA[El jefe de gabinete de la consejera de Industria y Turismo de la Generalitat Valenciana, Miguel Ángel Sánchez, ha presentado su dimisión tras verse implicado indirectamente en el escándalo de las adjudicaciones de vivienda pública en Alicante. La polémica surge al conocerse que la madre de sus dos hijas es beneficiaria de uno de los pisos de la primera promoción de vivienda protegida construida en la ciudad en los últimos 20 años, ubicada en un solar municipal especialmente cotizado, cercano a la playa de San Juan y dotado de servicios como piscina y pistas de pádel.

Las viviendas, un total de 140, fueron adjudicadas a un precio medio de 215.000 euros, aproximadamente la mitad de su valor de mercado, lo que ha generado una fuerte controversia política y social. Sánchez sostiene que está divorciado desde hace dos años y que no mantiene ningún vínculo jurídico, patrimonial ni administrativo con la adjudicación, asegurando que no ha intervenido directa ni indirectamente en el proceso.

El juez analiza de forma individualizada las cuatro faltas imputadas y pone especial énfasis en la ocurrida el 29 de noviembre de 2024, cuando la trabajadora tuvo que acudir de urgencia al veterinario ante el empeoramiento crítico del estado de salud de su animal, al que finalmente se le practicó la eutanasia.

Las autoridades han organizado un desalojo escalonado y han trasladado a los vecinos a alojamientos provisionales.

El temporal ha provocado el corte de más de 140 carreteras en todo el país, muchas de ellas en Andalucía, incluidas vías principales como la A-44 y la A-48.

A partir de datos recientes basados en el tráfico digital, se explica que siete grandes grupos controlan más de la mitad de las visitas a medios de noticias online en Estados Unidos.

Dicha conversación, que incluía referencias a presuntas cuentas bancarias y diálogos atribuidos al expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, fue negada rotundamente por ambas partes implicadas y nunca tuvo lugar.

En cuanto a la vivienda, Llamas ha criticado las políticas antiokupas que considera ineficaces y ha propuesto aumentar el parque público de viviendas en alquiler social y regular los precios del alquiler. Por su parte, en sanidad, ha señalado la desatención de la zona rural y la creciente privatización de los servicios como problemas graves.

Originalmente, 'facha' proviene de 'fascista', un concepto político que surgió en la Italia de Mussolini a comienzos del siglo XX. El fascismo fue un movimiento autoritario, ultranacionalista y totalitario que negaba las libertades individuales, controlaba todos los ámbitos de la sociedad y normalizaba la violencia como herramienta política. Reducir esta palabra a un insulto cotidiano empobrece el debate, pues hace difícil identificar comportamientos autoritarios reales. La noticia invita a la reflexión personal mediante un cuestionario sobre actitudes autoritarias, destacando que la verdadera esencia del fascismo va mucho más allá de una simple discrepancia política.

El texto repasa el ascenso del franquismo a partir de un contexto de crisis económica y política, el papel central del nacionalismo excluyente, la alianza con la Iglesia católica y la utilización del miedo al 'enemigo interno' para justificar la represión. Se subraya cómo el régimen debilitó la resistencia social mediante el control de los cuerpos, especialmente de las mujeres, restringiendo derechos reproductivos y reforzando roles tradicionales como parte de una estrategia de reproducción ideológica.

En aquel momento, Podemos había irrumpido con fuerza en el Congreso con 69 escaños y más del 20% de los votos, mientras Ciudadanos también obtenía relevancia pero sin capacidad para pactos mayoritarios con el PP o PSOE. El informe del banco alemán detallaba cuatro posibles escenarios: una investidura de Pedro Sánchez con el apoyo de Podemos y los nacionalistas, un acuerdo entre PSOE, Podemos y Ciudadanos, un pacto entre PSOE, PP y Ciudadanos, o elecciones anticipadas. Aunque las élites españolas buscaban impedir la formación de un gobierno progresista, el banco consideraba probable un escenario con participación de Podemos.

La declaración está prevista para el próximo 3 de junio y se considera una diligencia clave antes de que la magistrada solicite formalmente la imputación de Millán ante el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid, órgano competente al tratarse de una persona aforada.

Santos Ceballos figura entre los familiares que, según la investigación, se habrían beneficiado de contratos o trabajos concedidos por un empresario imputado, Francisco Roselló, durante la etapa en la que Ana Millán era concejala en el Ayuntamiento de Arroyomolinos. En concreto, la Guardia Civil sostiene que el empresario contrató al marido de Millán y a otros familiares mientras sus empresas recibían adjudicaciones públicas desde la concejalía que ella dirigía.

Los resultados principales indican que un mayor consumo acumulado de cannabis se asocia de forma general con volúmenes mayores en varias regiones cerebrales clave (especialmente aquellas con alta densidad de receptores CB1, como el hipocampo) y con un mejor desempeño en pruebas cognitivas relacionadas con memoria, aprendizaje, velocidad de procesamiento, atención y funciones ejecutivas.

La investigadora principal, Anika Guha, destaca que estos hallazgos positivos fueron sorprendentes, ya que contrarrestan muchos estudios previos centrados en adolescentes o en efectos agudos negativos.

Ambos científicos, hasta ahora vinculados a universidades y centros de referencia en Nueva York, se han incorporado al Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont (ICP), en Sabadell, gracias a los programas de captación de talento ICREA y Catalunya Talent Bridge impulsados por la Generalitat.

La decisión coincide con un deterioro del clima académico en Estados Unidos, especialmente en áreas como la evolución humana, que, según explican, se ha convertido en un ámbito problemático por motivos ideológicos.

A través del lenguaje visual y del humor, la pieza reflexiona sobre los mecanismos de manipulación de la opinión pública en el contexto actual, marcado por el auge de la ultraderecha, la centralidad de las redes sociales y el poder creciente de grandes plataformas digitales.

La ilustración apunta de manera directa a figuras y dinámicas reconocibles del debate público contemporáneo, como el papel de líderes políticos de la ultraderecha —entre ellos Santiago Abascal— y la influencia de magnates tecnológicos como Elon Musk en el ecosistema informativo. La viñeta sugiere cómo discursos simplificados, emocionalmente cargados y amplificados algorítmicamente pueden moldear percepciones colectivas, desplazar debates complejos y normalizar marcos ideológicos extremos.

Quiles, conocido por perseguir a cargos públicos con preguntas provocadoras fuera de contextos informativos convencionales, increpó a Iglesias en plena calle utilizando argumentos habituales de la extrema derecha, como la teoría del “gran reemplazo”, y ataques personales relacionados con su trayectoria política y profesional.

Durante el encuentro, Quiles lanzó preguntas sobre supuestas declaraciones de Irene Montero y sobre el futuro político de Iglesias, insistiendo en un tono provocador mientras grababa la escena para difundirla posteriormente en redes sociales. Ante esta situación, Iglesias respondió de forma airada, calificando a Quiles de “fascista” y “cerdo”, e intentando apartar el micrófono del canal Estado de Alarma, medio vinculado a Javier Negre.

Durante la emisión, la presentadora Sonsoles Ónega y un colaborador identificaron la escena como una autovía urbana con los laterales inundados a causa de la borrasca Leonardo. Sin embargo, la interpretación resultó ser incorrecta y rápidamente llamó la atención de quienes conocen mínimamente la geografía gaditana.

El Puente Carranza no es una autovía urbana, sino la carretera CA-36, con un carril por sentido y otro reversible, y atraviesa directamente la Bahía de Cádiz. Al estar construido sobre el mar, no existen cunetas ni márgenes terrestres que puedan inundarse: los laterales y la parte inferior del puente están permanentemente rodeados de agua salada.

Alfonso Serrano, secretario general del PP madrileño y número dos de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha asegurado que no se trató en ningún momento de un caso de acoso, sino de una disputa de carácter laboral sin pruebas que la respaldaran.

Según la versión de Serrano, la denunciante trasladó inicialmente al partido un escrito en febrero de 2024 en el que hablaba exclusivamente de discriminaciones laborales. En una reunión posterior, la dirección del PP le preguntó expresamente si estaba denunciando acoso o abuso sexual, a lo que ella habría respondido negativamente.

En los primeros días se desactivaron o bloquearon alrededor de 4,7 millones de cuentas identificadas como pertenecientes a menores de esa edad, y cifras posteriores elevan el impacto, con más de 415.000 cuentas inhabilitadas solo en Snapchat hasta finales de enero de 2026.

Desde su creación en 2023, la entidad ha adquirido ocho pisos propiedad de grandes tenedores y fondos de inversión, muchos de ellos con inquilinos en situación de vulnerabilidad y bajo amenaza de desahucio. Gracias a este modelo, unas 30 personas, entre ellas diez menores, han logrado una solución habitacional estable.

El proyecto surge de años de trabajo comunitario y de apoyo mutuo en el barrio, donde el problema de la vivienda se identificó como el principal factor de precariedad.

El autor no idealiza el pasado, pero defiende que crecer en un entorno imperfecto enseñaba a desarrollar criterio, instinto y resiliencia, algo que considera en peligro con las políticas de “riesgo cero”.

Arjona cuestiona que la prohibición sea una medida de salud pública basada en evidencias sólidas. Apoyándose en estudios recientes y en las tesis del psiquiatra Sami Timimi, sostiene que existe una tendencia a simplificar problemas complejos mediante soluciones rápidas y efectistas, lo que denomina la “McDonaldización de la salud mental”. Según esta lógica, prohibir las redes calma la ansiedad adulta y genera titulares políticos, pero no aborda las causas profundas]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prohibir-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-entre-la-proteccion-el-miedo-y-la-renuncia-educativa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prohibir-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-entre-la-proteccion-el-miedo-y-la-renuncia-educativa</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 13:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recuperado en el Palacio de Liria un retrato de Sorolla y dos obras más que debían formar parte del patrimonio estatal]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha recuperado tres obras de arte desaparecidas desde la década de 1970 que se encontraban depositadas en el Palacio de Liria, en Madrid, propiedad de la Casa de Alba.

La obra, de grandes dimensiones, había perdido su rastro durante décadas y su localización se produjo en el marco de una investigación iniciada tras detectarse una pintura cuyo paradero no estaba claro durante una exposición organizada por la propia Casa de Alba entre 2023 y 2024.

Además del lienzo de Sorolla, los agentes localizaron otros dos óleos del pintor José Moreno Carbonero: un retrato de Alfonso XIII y otro de Eduardo Dato.

Este resultado, que ha despertado un enorme interés científico y social, abre la puerta a futuros ensayos clínicos en humanos, previstos dentro de dos o tres años. Sin embargo, el principal obstáculo para dar ese paso es la falta de financiación suficiente.

El coste mínimo estimado para iniciar los ensayos clínicos en humanos asciende a unos 30 millones de euros, una cantidad que no está cubierta por los actuales Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Aunque el CNIO recibió en 2023 un total de 36,5 millones de euros en subvenciones públicas, estos fondos se destinan a la actividad global del centro, que desarrolla decenas de proyectos simultáneos, y no de forma exclusiva al estudio de Barbacid.

La alerta surgió cuando vecinos detectaron una antena parabólica de dos metros en el jardín de un apartamento alquilado por Airbnb, que interfería con la señal de internet del vecindario. La policía francesa investigó el lugar y halló un complejo sistema tecnológico que permitía interceptar datos satelitales, incluyendo información de la red Starlink, utilizada en comunicaciones críticas y posibles aplicaciones militares. Cuatro hombres de nacionalidad china fueron detenidos, acusados de delitos relacionados con la ciberdelincuencia y el suministro de información a una potencia extranjera. Dos de ellos se presentaron como ingenieros de una empresa que colabora en proyectos de educación, comunicaciones y militares, aunque sus relatos mostraban incongruencias. Además, se investigó otro negocio vinculado a los detenidos donde se encontraron más antenas y ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detienen-a-cuatro-ciudadanos-chinos-en-francia-por-posible-espionaje-usando-antenas-en-apartamentos-de-airbnb</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detienen-a-cuatro-ciudadanos-chinos-en-francia-por-posible-espionaje-usando-antenas-en-apartamentos-de-airbnb</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 11:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[David Uclés rechaza participar en jornadas sobre la Guerra Civil organizadas por Pérez-Reverte y critica la equidistancia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La columnista Pilar Garcés expresa su admiración por el escritor David Uclés, autor de 'La península de las casas vacías', una novela que califica de obra maestra con gran impacto, ventas de 300.000 ejemplares y reciente ganador del Premio Nadal por otra obra. Destaca cómo Uclés, pese a su éxito y proyección, ha decidido boicotear unas jornadas sobre la Guerra Civil organizadas por Arturo Pérez-Reverte, tituladas '1936. La guerra que todos perdimos'. Uclés se niega a compartir cartel con figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a quienes considera inadecuados, y rechaza el lema del evento por considerarlo falso y complaciente con la derecha revisionista, ya que argumenta que la guerra no la perdieron todos, sino que la ganaron los franquistas y la sufrieron especialmente los republicanos. Esta decisión provocó otras bajas y el aplazamiento del evento a octubre, lo que la autora ve como un triunfo contra la equidistancia y el 'guerracivilismo' forzado.

Lo que debía haber sido un momento de celebración se vio empañado por una oleada de insultos y ataques personales en redes sociales, motivados por el idioma que utilizó en una entrevista posterior a la competición. Delago habló en ladino, su lengua materna, durante una conversación con RAI Ladinia, el canal público italiano que emite íntegramente en este idioma.

Los comentarios ofensivos, lanzados principalmente por usuarios anónimos o los llamados “leones de teclado”, incluían mensajes como “si representas a Italia, habla italiano” o insultos de carácter xenófobo. Estas reacciones generaron un debate público sobre la diversidad lingüística en Italia y el derecho a utilizar lenguas minoritarias en espacios mediáticos y deportivos.

Inicialmente, Bezos mantuvo la independencia editorial y permitió que el medio realizara un periodismo crítico y de calidad, convirtiéndose en un referente durante la presidencia de Donald Trump. Sin embargo, con el tiempo, intervenciones directas en decisiones editoriales y cambios estratégicos destinados a la rentabilidad llevaron a despidos masivos y a la eliminación de secciones clave como noticias locales, deportes y corresponsalías internacionales. La publicación perdió suscriptores y buena parte de su identidad como periódico independiente y local. El artículo destaca la paradoja de que, a pesar de contar con una fortuna personal colosal, Bezos optó por sacrificar la esencia del medio en lugar de asumir pérdidas económicas, lo que contrasta con la dedicación de históricos magnates de la prensa como William Randolph Hearst.

Discovery por parte de Netflix. En lugar de centrarse en cuestiones de competencia, Hawley dedicó buena parte de su turno a atacar el contenido de la plataforma, especialmente la presencia de personajes y temáticas trans en programas dirigidos al público infantil.

Hawley acusó a Netflix de promover lo que denominó una “ideología transgénero”, llegando a afirmar, sin aportar pruebas, que casi la mitad de los contenidos infantiles de la plataforma impulsan esta supuesta agenda. El codirector ejecutivo de Netflix, Ted Sarandos, negó rotundamente esas cifras y calificó los datos de inexactos, señalando que no sabía de dónde procedían.

Se eliminó la obligatoriedad de inscribirse en el Registro de demanda de vivienda de la Generalitat y de presentar una declaración responsable que acreditara el cumplimiento de requisitos para acceder a estas viviendas. Estos mecanismos actuaban como filtro inicial antes del visado final por parte de la Conselleria. La normativa anterior pretendía garantizar transparencia y evitar fraudes en la adjudicación.

La Conselleria de Vivienda defiende el cambio argumentando que separa mejor los demandantes de promoción pública y privada (con perfiles y rentas distintos), y que el nuevo decreto refuerza los controles en la fase de visado, incluyendo autorizaciones para verificar datos tributarios y económicos con otras administraciones.

Los hechos tuvieron como víctima a un joven que fue perseguido, insultado y golpeado por un grupo de personas por motivo de su orientación sexual. Según el relato judicial, los agresores le gritaron expresiones como 'maricón de mierda' y 'mira cómo corre el maricón' mientras se burlaban de él antes de alcanzarlo y atacarlo físicamente.

Durante el juicio celebrado en la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, los dos acusados reconocieron haber insultado y acosado verbalmente a la víctima, aunque negaron haberle golpeado directamente y atribuyeron los puñetazos a un tercer amigo.

En México, figuras como José Vasconcelos y Elena Torres Cuéllar impulsaron la educación rural, la construcción de bibliotecas y la publicación de libros y folletos accesibles a la población.

Los informes de seguimiento de las pruebas piloto realizadas durante el último año muestran que reducir la jornada laboral a 32 horas semanales y ofrecer flexibilidad horaria mejora significativamente la salud emocional de las trabajadoras y trabajadores. Expertas en sociología y psicología del trabajo destacan que este modelo disminuye el agotamiento crónico (burnout), ya que un tercer día de descanso permite una desconexión real que la jornada tradicional de 40 horas no garantiza. Además, las trabajadoras que experimentan bienestar emocional son un 15% más productivas y tienen un 40% menos de bajas por ansiedad.

Aunque nació como una herramienta para garantizar el acceso a la vivienda a hogares de ingresos bajos y medios, la reducción sostenida de su producción y la flexibilización de los requisitos de acceso han ido desdibujando su función social. En un contexto de crisis residencial y subida generalizada de precios, las VPO son cada vez menos y están dirigidas a rentas más altas.

Desde 1991 se han construido cerca de 1,7 millones de viviendas protegidas en España, pero muchas de ellas han perdido con el tiempo su calificación y han pasado al mercado libre, contribuyendo a la escalada de precios. La producción actual está en mínimos históricos: en 1995 se concedieron más VPO que en todo el periodo comprendido entre 2017 y 2025.

La detención de Francisco de Borbón se enmarca en una investigación más amplia iniciada en 2024, cuando fue arrestado Óscar Sánchez Gil, inspector jefe de la UDEF, al que se le atribuye haber ocultado en su domicilio cerca de 20 millones de euros.

Entre los nombres citados en los documentos figuran empresarios y personalidades públicas de distintos países, lo que ha incrementado el interés mediático y la circulación de interpretaciones especulativas. En este contexto, ha resurgido un episodio ocurrido en México en 2009 protagonizado por Gabriela Rico Jiménez, una joven que, durante una crisis nerviosa frente a un hotel de lujo en Monterrey, realizó graves acusaciones contra miembros de las élites políticas y empresariales, llegando a afirmar la existencia de asesinatos rituales y canibalismo.

En este sentido, calificó el ecosistema digital actual como “antidemocrático”, al considerar que está controlado por un número muy reducido de grandes empresarios tecnológicos, a los que se refirió como “caudillos digitales”, con un enorme poder ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sira-rego-plantea-restringir-o-prohibir-x-por-vulneraciones-de-derechos-fundamentales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sira-rego-plantea-restringir-o-prohibir-x-por-vulneraciones-de-derechos-fundamentales</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 07:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Policía informa al juez de que Begoña Gómez aún no ha entregado su pasaporte en el marco de la investigación judicial]]></title><description><![CDATA[La situación judicial de Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, vuelve a situarse en el centro del debate público tras un mensaje publicado en la red social X por Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, exsecretario de Estado.

Según consta en el procedimiento, la Policía ha comunicado al juez Juan Carlos Peinado, titular del Juzgado de Instrucción número 41 de Madrid, que ni Begoña Gómez ni su asistente, Cristina Álvarez, han entregado aún sus pasaportes. Este requerimiento fue emitido el 7 de noviembre de 2025 y trasladado formalmente a las defensas de ambas investigadas.

Destacó que las incautaciones de cocaína, aunque históricas, no afectan a los verdaderos beneficiarios del negocio, y que las sanciones económicas como las listas OFAC son insuficientes si no se persiguen los capitales ilícitos a nivel global.

El suceso ocurrió el lunes por la noche en un tren regional que cubría la ruta entre Kaiserslautern y Saarbrücken, en el suroeste del país, según informó la compañía ferroviaria Deutsche Bahn (DB).

Durante un control rutinario de billetes, el revisor, identificado como Serkan C., detectó que un joven de 26 años no disponía de título de transporte. Al intentar expulsarlo del convoy, el pasajero reaccionó con extrema violencia y golpeó repetidamente al empleado en la cabeza. El ataque se produjo poco después de que el tren saliera de la estación de Landstuhl, en el distrito de Kaiserslautern.

Como consecuencia de la agresión, el revisor quedó gravemente herido y tuvo que ser reanimado en el propio lugar de los hechos antes de ser trasladado de urgencia a un hospital en estado crítico. Pese a los esfuerzos médicos, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/muere-un-revisor-ferroviario-en-alemania-tras-ser-agredido-durante-un-control-de-billetes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/muere-un-revisor-ferroviario-en-alemania-tras-ser-agredido-durante-un-control-de-billetes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Feijóo confunde repetidamente el nombre de la empresa Fribin durante una visita de campaña en Aragón]]></title><description><![CDATA[El líder del Partido Popular, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, ha protagonizado un episodio llamativo durante la recta final de la campaña electoral en Aragón al visitar la empresa cárnica Fribin, situada en Binéfar (Huesca). En el transcurso de su intervención pública desde las instalaciones de la compañía, Feijóo se refirió hasta en ocho ocasiones a la empresa con un nombre incorrecto, llamándola “Brifín” en lugar de Fribin, pese a que el rótulo con el nombre real era claramente visible a su espalda.

La visita formaba parte de una gira por Aragón para respaldar al candidato del PP, Jorge Azcón, y poner en valor el papel del sector primario y de la industria agroalimentaria en el desarrollo económico del medio rural. Durante su discurso, Feijóo destacó la trayectoria de la empresa, con más de 60 años de historia en la provincia de Huesca, su capacidad exportadora —con un 70% de su producción destinada al exterior— y su peso económico en la comarca de La Litera, donde supone alrededor del 10% de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/feijoo-confunde-repetidamente-el-nombre-de-la-empresa-fribin-durante-una-visita-de-campana-en-aragon</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/feijoo-confunde-repetidamente-el-nombre-de-la-empresa-fribin-durante-una-visita-de-campana-en-aragon</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Choque entre el Gobierno y los dueños de las redes por la regulación y la responsabilidad penal de las plataformas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez ha intensificado su enfrentamiento con los grandes propietarios de redes sociales tras anunciar un paquete de medidas destinadas a proteger a los menores y a combatir la difusión de contenidos de odio y desinformación. El detonante más reciente ha sido un mensaje masivo enviado por Pável Dúrov, fundador y consejero delegado de Telegram, a todos los usuarios españoles de la plataforma, en el que acusa al Ejecutivo de impulsar normativas que amenazan las libertades digitales y pueden derivar en un Estado vigilado. Sánchez respondió públicamente calificando a estos empresarios como “tecnooligarcas” y defendiendo que las críticas demuestran que el Gobierno está tocando un núcleo de poder real.

Las propuestas del Ejecutivo incluyen prohibir el uso de redes sociales a menores de 16 años y modificar la legislación para que los directivos de las plataformas puedan responder penalmente si no retiran contenidos ilegales o de odio.

La novela, concebida como una carta de amor onírica y surrealista a Barcelona, presenta una ciudad múltiple y superpuesta, construida a partir de capas temporales y voces literarias que abarcan distintas épocas y sensibilidades culturales.

Uclés explica que su acercamiento a Barcelona fue fruto de una estancia prolongada gracias a la beca Montserrat Roig, durante la cual se sumergió en la literatura catalana y en la historia cultural de la ciudad. De ese proceso surge un relato coral, con más de 80 artistas e intelectuales, que busca provocar al lector y transmitir una imagen caótica y rica de Barcelona, similar a un mosaico o un *trencadís*.

Según fuentes cercanas a Errejón, Mouliaá tomó la decisión antes de que su abogado dejara de representarla, con la intención de vincular la retirada de su denuncia a la eliminación de la querella de Errejón, algo que su defensa descarta. La querella por calumnias se mantendrá, con el objetivo de demostrar la inocencia de Errejón hasta el final del proceso judicial. Mouliaá ha aclarado que su decisión no constituye una retractación, sino un límite personal debido a la difícil situación que ha vivido al sostener sola la denuncia. La acusación popular seguirá adelante a pesar de que la Fiscalía de Madrid no presentará cargos, ya que la agresión sexual es un delito semipúblico y la causa puede continuar mediante la acción de la acusación pública o popular.

Aunque ambas formaciones defienden desde hace tiempo la necesidad de regularizar a cientos de miles de personas que ya viven y trabajan en España, el desacuerdo surge por la estrategia política y el discurso público en torno a los derechos asociados a esa regularización.

Sumar considera que las declaraciones de Irene Montero, en las que plantea ampliar el derecho al voto a los inmigrantes regularizados o incluso cambiar la ley para permitirlo, refuerzan el marco argumental de PP y Vox. Desde la confluencia magenta sostienen que vincular regularización y voto alimenta el relato de la derecha y la extrema derecha sobre una supuesta manipulación del censo electoral, algo que el Gobierno niega de forma reiterada.

Se trata de tres BMW híbridos enchufables, sin rotular y no integrados en el parque operativo, asignados al director general de Bomberos y a otros dos mandos de guardia.

Según una nota interna a la que ha tenido acceso Radio Madrid, no existe una justificación operativa clara que explique la necesidad de estos vehículos, más allá de posibles desplazamientos internos, reuniones o, de forma genérica, la asistencia a siniestros. Desde el sindicato CCOO subrayan que los tres responsables ya disponían de vehículos oficiales y conductores con disponibilidad permanente, por lo que consideran la compra redundante e injustificada.

El autor, Raúl Ibáñez, conecta esta cuestión con obras de arte de Max Bill basadas en triángulos isoareales y con el libro 'Triángulo amoroso' (2025) del matemático australiano Matt Parker, donde se presenta este ejemplo para ilustrar la fórmula del área de un triángulo (base por altura dividido por dos).

Se describen métodos clásicos para dividir en dos partes (por la diagonal o por el centro) y en cuatro (por las dos diagonales o cortes perpendiculares), destacando que todos generan piezas equivalentes. Para tres partes, un corte paralelo simple falla en igualar el borde, ya que los trozos centrales y laterales difieren en corteza.

La solución propuesta por Parker consiste en dividir cada lado del cuadrado en tres segmentos iguales, agrupar el perímetro en tres]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-dividir-un-sandwich-cuadrado-en-tres-partes-iguales-en-superficie-y-borde-usando-matematicas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-dividir-un-sandwich-cuadrado-en-tres-partes-iguales-en-superficie-y-borde-usando-matematicas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 21:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vecinos de Minneapolis protestan frente al despliegue de agentes del ICE tras disparos mortales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un vídeo que se ha vuelto viral muestra cómo vecinos y estudiantes de Minneapolis se enfrentaron verbalmente a agentes federales de inmigración (ICE) desplegados tras los disparos que acabaron con la vida de Alex Pretti y Renee Good.

Miles de personas participaron en las protestas pese a las bajas temperaturas, llegando incluso a formar un ‘SOS’ gigante en el lago congelado de Maka Ska como símbolo de emergencia y rechazo a las acciones de ICE. Ante la presión ciudadana, la Administración Trump anunció la retirada inmediata de 700 agentes en Minnesota, aunque unos 2.000 permanecerán en el estado para continuar investigaciones específicas.

Ambos fallecieron en el acto. Según reveló el diario alemán Bild, el agresor había llegado a Alemania en 2024 mediante un programa de reasentamiento humanitario coordinado por la ONU y aceptado por el Estado alemán para personas consideradas especialmente vulnerables.

El hombre, nacido en Sudán del Sur, perdió a sus padres a manos de combatientes islamistas y pasó una década en un campo de refugiados en Kenia antes de ser seleccionado para el programa. Entre enero de 2024 y junio de 2025, Alemania acogió a casi 7.000 refugiados bajo este sistema, principalmente de Siria y Afganistán, además de otros países africanos. El programa fue cancelado a mediados de 2025, aunque organizaciones pro-asilo siguen litigando para que continúe.

Un análisis realizado por la Cadena SER a partir de estadísticas de Eurostat muestra que la accidentalidad ferroviaria en España es un 37 % inferior a la media europea cuando se mide en accidentes por millón de tren-kilómetro, una unidad estándar que tiene en cuenta la distancia total recorrida por los trenes.

España se sitúa así por delante de países como Alemania, Francia, Italia o Polonia, este último con una red de tamaño comparable. En términos de mortalidad, los resultados son aún más favorables: la tasa española es un 83 % inferior a la media europea, lo que coloca al país como el sexto con menor mortalidad ferroviaria del continente.

Según el informe policial remitido a la Audiencia Nacional, Sánchez habría facilitado la entrada de 58,5 toneladas de cocaína ocultas en 37 contenedores marítimos procedentes de Latinoamérica, con un valor estimado superior a los 2.060 millones de euros. A cambio, habría recibido al menos 32 millones de euros.

La investigación se apoya de forma decisiva en el volcado del teléfono móvil de Ignacio Torán, considerado el cabecilla de la organización criminal, donde se hallaron anotaciones detalladas, pantallazos y mensajes que evidencian una relación prolongada con el inspector jefe, conocido entre los narcos como “El Amigo”.
