The director explained that New Zealand's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including achieving a 98% vaccination rate and effectively eliminating the virus multiple times, influenced his move. In contrast, Cameron criticized the U.S. for its declining vaccination rates and polarization, describing the country as turning its back on science and potentially at risk if another pandemic arises. Cameron also noted that he finds New Zealand safer for his family and appreciates its respectful social environment. He expressed frustration with American politics, particularly under Donald Trump's leadership, calling it a deviation from the country's historical values. Cameron emphasized that his move is about finding sanity and stability rather than scenic beauty. He previously mentioned that his New Zealand citizenship was imminent and highlighted ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/james-cameron-explains-why-he-relocated-to-new-zealand-citing-public-health-and-political-concerns-in-the-u-s</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/james-cameron-explains-why-he-relocated-to-new-zealand-citing-public-health-and-political-concerns-in-the-u-s</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 06:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Barry Williams Reflects on His Teenage Relationship with Maureen McCormick During 'The Brady Bunch' Years]]></title><description><![CDATA[Actor Barry Williams, best known for playing Greg Brady on the classic ABC sitcom 'The Brady Bunch,' recently spoke about his past relationship with co-star Maureen McCormick during an appearance on 'I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here! Australia.' Now 71 years old, Williams described how the young cast developed strong emotional connections while filming the iconic series, which aired between 1969 and 1974. Comparing their on-set experiences to a reality dating show, he explained that isolation from peers their own age and the long hours spent together naturally led to close friendships and occasional romances. Williams praised McCormick, who portrayed Marcia Brady, calling her 'the hottest girl on television at the time' and recalling how her charm extended far beyond the show. He emphasized that emotional bonds within the cast were genuine and supportive, noting that everyone relied on each other because they shared the unique pressures of early fame. According to Williams, many cast]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/barry-williams-reflects-on-his-teenage-relationship-with-maureen-mccormick-during-the-brady-bunch-years</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/barry-williams-reflects-on-his-teenage-relationship-with-maureen-mccormick-during-the-brady-bunch-years</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Petition urges Producers Guild to reconsider Blake Lively’s producer credit on 'It Ends With Us']]></title><description><![CDATA[An online petition calling on the Producers Guild of America (PGA) to reconsider Blake Lively’s producer credit on the film It Ends With Us has gained notable traction in recent days. Hosted on Change.org, the petition began drawing increased attention after a U.S. judge unsealed court documents related to an ongoing legal dispute between Lively and actor-director Justin Baldoni. These filings reportedly included private text messages involving Lively, Taylor Swift, and Baldoni, which some observers believe have intensified public scrutiny around the film’s production credits.

According to the article, the petition initially had around 1,900 signatures but has since grown to more than 3,300, with hundreds of new supporters signing on over a short period. The petition specifically calls for the rescinding of Lively’s “Produced By” credit, an official designation overseen by the PGA that can influence industry prestige, professional recognition, and eligibility for major awards such as ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/petition-urges-producers-guild-to-reconsider-blake-lively-s-producer-credit-on-it-ends-with-us</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/petition-urges-producers-guild-to-reconsider-blake-lively-s-producer-credit-on-it-ends-with-us</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[American Airlines adds Aer Lingus as a new mileage redemption partner to Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aer Lingus, the Irish flag carrier, has officially become bookable with American Airlines AAdvantage miles for the first time. Although the partnership between American and Aer Lingus began in 2022, until now travelers could only earn AAdvantage miles when flying Aer Lingus, not redeem them. This long-awaited update finally allows AAdvantage members to use their miles to book Aer Lingus flights directly through the American Airlines platform. The award pricing follows AA’s partner chart, with economy awards priced between 22,500 and 30,000 miles each way, and business class awards set at 57,500 miles each way between the U.S. and Europe. Taxes and fees are minimal, estimated at $5.60 from U.S. departures and around $45–50 from Dublin flights. While award availability is best from the U.S. Northeast, options extend to multiple American airports.

The bill passed its first reading with the support of 19 lawmakers and no opposition votes, according to Israel's public broadcaster KAN. The legislation proposes establishing a dedicated judicial tribunal, chaired by a retired district court judge, to handle cases related to charges such as terrorism, genocide, aiding the enemy during wartime, and actions undermining state sovereignty. Convictions under this system could result in capital punishment, and defendants would be barred from participating in any future prisoner exchanges or political negotiations. Hearings would also be broadcast live and archived in Israel’s state records. The bill will now move to the Constitution Committee for further review before its second and third readings, which are required under Israeli law for legislation to becom]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israeli-knesset-passes-first-reading-of-bill-allowing-death-penalty-for-palestinians-involved-in-oct-7-events</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israeli-knesset-passes-first-reading-of-bill-allowing-death-penalty-for-palestinians-involved-in-oct-7-events</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hennepin County Medical Examiner Classifies Renee Good's Death as Homicide Following ICE Shooting]]></title><description><![CDATA[Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis on January 7, 2026, during an operation known as Metro Surge. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner officially classified her death as a homicide, which means one person caused the death of another, but it does not necessarily indicate a crime was committed. According to reports, Good suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including two to her chest, one to her left forearm, and a possible wound to her head. The shooting occurred near East 34th Street and Portland Avenue, where witnesses described a chaotic scene with multiple ICE agents attempting to engage with Good inside her vehicle. Federal authorities claimed the shooting was in self-defense, asserting that Good tried to use her vehicle as a weapon against officers. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey publicly rejected this explanation, calling it misleading. Emergency responders found Good unresponsive and attempted resuscitation, but she was p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hennepin-county-medical-examiner-classifies-renee-good-s-death-as-homicide-following-ice-shooting</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hennepin-county-medical-examiner-classifies-renee-good-s-death-as-homicide-following-ice-shooting</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Record Numbers of Ladybirds in the UK in 2025 Due to Favourable Weather and Abundant Food Sources]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2025, the UK has experienced an exceptional surge in ladybird populations, with these beloved beetles appearing in record numbers across gardens, homes, and even disrupting events like a cricket match at Lord's. Experts, including Professor Helen Roy from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and the University of Exeter, attribute this boom to several favourable conditions. A mild winter allowed many ladybirds to emerge successfully from hibernation, followed by a dry spring that produced high numbers of aphids—the primary food source for many ladybird species. Subsequent warm, humid summer weather and heatwaves enabled the new generation to thrive, complete their life cycles quickly, and multiply rapidly. While some sightings involve the invasive harlequin ladybird, which tends to cluster in large groups indoors or on structures, most are harmless native species like the seven-spot ladybird. Ladybirds pose no threat to humans or pets: they do not sting, are not poisonous, and the ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-numbers-of-ladybirds-in-the-uk-in-2025-due-to-favourable-weather-and-abundant-food-sources</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-numbers-of-ladybirds-in-the-uk-in-2025-due-to-favourable-weather-and-abundant-food-sources</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Border Patrol Agents Fatally Shoot 37-Year-Old US Citizen Alex Pretti During Minneapolis Immigration Enforcement Operation]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 24, 2026, 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen and intensive care nurse employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, was fatally shot by United States Border Patrol agents at the intersection of 26th Street and Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The incident occurred amid Operation Metro Surge, part of broader immigration enforcement efforts in the second Trump administration, and marked the third shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within a short period, following the deaths of Renée Good and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis. Video footage captured Pretti filming agents with his phone and assisting with traffic direction before being pepper-sprayed and tackled by multiple agents. Witnesses and analyses by outlets like The New York Times indicated he was holding a cell phone, not a firearm, in the moments leading up to the shooting, during which approximately ten shots were fired.

On January 24, 2026, Border Patrol agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at a VA hospital, during an encounter amid immigration enforcement operations and related protests. Official statements from the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Pretti approached agents armed with a gun, though this has been disputed by family and witnesses. Rittenhouse shared an Instagram story about 'liberating Minneapolis' and posted a 'how to stay alive' tip advising against pulling guns on federal agents. He also shared an AI-generated image depicting himself armed in what appeared to be Minneapolis.

The event became a turning point that strained relations between both governments. Washington allegedly challenged South Africa’s internal governance and refused to recognize the country’s transfer of the G20 presidency as legitimate. Following these tensions, Trump reportedly decided that the U.S. would push for South Africa’s removal from the group in 2026. In response, South Africa announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos that it would voluntarily withdraw from participating this year rather than risk official exclusion. According to Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, the United States effectively controlled delegation accreditation, which restricted South Africa’s representation at G20 meetings. Pretoria framed its withdrawal as a dignified, sovereign decision rather than a concession, preserving its internatio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-between-the-u-s-and-south-africa-lead-to-withdrawal-from-the-g20</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-between-the-u-s-and-south-africa-lead-to-withdrawal-from-the-g20</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Border Patrol shooting in Minneapolis leaves one man injured, investigation underway]]></title><description><![CDATA[A shooting occurred outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue South in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, around 9 a.m. local time. According to multiple local news outlets, Border Patrol agents were involved in the incident, during which a man was reportedly shot following a physical struggle. Video footage from the scene showed several agents and first responders performing chest compressions on the wounded man, who appeared unconscious. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Border Patrol have yet to release an official statement explaining why shots were fired. Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reported that the man was 'down' as medics attempted to revive him, and later sources within DHS confirmed that the suspect was armed and that a firearm had been recovered at the scene.

The city of Minneapolis issued an advisory asking residents to avoid the area around 26th Street West and Nicollet Avenue while authorities investigate.

The initiative, developed in partnership with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, aims to improve the financial stability and health outcomes of working-class Arizonans burdened by healthcare costs. According to the governor, reducing medical debt is a vital step toward fulfilling what she calls the “Arizona Promise,” a vision of economic opportunity and dignity for all residents. 

This debt relief effort forms part of a larger $2 billion statewide program designed to cancel medical debt using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds. These funds enable the state to purchase outstanding medical debt from hospitals and collection agencies for a fraction of its face value, then forgive the balance without requiring individuals to apply.

It highlights economic monopolization, particularly how three companies dominate agriculture and food distribution, stifling competition and turning daily life into profit opportunities for capital. Wages have stagnated despite rising productivity, forcing 8.4 million Americans into multiple jobs to survive, while employees at giants like Walmart and Amazon often rely on government food assistance. The piece traces the erosion of social safety nets to the Reagan era in the 1980s, including cuts to unemployment benefits, Social Security, and public education investment—such as introducing tuition fees at the previously free University of California system. This has left workers vulnerable to irreversible economic disasters.

The DHS stated that the man was armed and resisting arrest during a scuffle, though details remain unclear about the exact sequence of events and whether he was actively holding a weapon at the moment he was shot. The shooting sparked immediate protests, with crowds scattering as agents used tear gas.

The report claims that this strategy resembles efforts previously seen in Venezuela and includes economic pressure tactics such as blocking shipments of Venezuelan oil to Cuba. The alleged objective is to weaken Cuba’s energy supply and accelerate a government collapse from within.

The article portrays the endeavor as part of what it calls a new 'destabilization manual'—a plan for a rapid and controlled political transition. It notes that no official U.S. documents confirm this strategy, implying that Washington is still studying its options. The piece also highlights Cuba’s diminished international support, particularly from Latin American allies such as Venezuela, whose own domestic crises have reduced assistance to Havana.

It explains that Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States in exchange for $25 million in gold—equivalent to roughly $633 million today—creating what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands. The treaty also included a clause recognizing Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland. The piece then transitions to the history of Little Saint James, known as 'Epstein Island,' which Epstein purchased in 1998 through his company LSJ for a little over $10 million. The island, covering only a few hundred meters, became infamous as the main location for Epstein’s alleged crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors. The article recounts reports from locals and airport workers who claim Epstein flew underage girls to the island using private aircraft to evade customs controls.

According to local medical sources, the attack occurred while the boys were collecting firewood near Kamal Adwan Hospital, marking a further breach of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas signed in October 2025. The Palestinian health ministry reported that their deaths raised the total number of casualties since the truce to 483, with more than 1,300 injured and 713 bodies recovered so far. The United Nations confirmed at least 216 additional Palestinian fatalities, including 46 children and 28 women, in Israeli strikes that occurred far from the front lines.

Eligible individuals can earn 125,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $15,000 within the first three months of card membership. This targeted promotion stands out because it lacks the standard 'once-per-lifetime' language that typically restricts welcome bonuses to those who have never held the card before. As a result, even people who currently hold or have previously held the Business Gold card may qualify if they receive the offer. The public standard offer for this card is generally 100,000 points after meeting similar spend requirements, making this 125,000-point version notably better for those targeted. The article highlights that such no-lifetime-language (NLL) deals provide a valuable workaround to Amex's usual restrictions on repeat bonuses.

Since early January, around 2,000 ICE agents have been deployed to Minnesota, allegedly for a fraud investigation, but have instead been accused of violent and unlawful behavior, including fatal shootings and assaults against civilians. A federal judge has attempted to restrain their actions, yet the Trump administration has declared 'absolute immunity' for ICE agents and has opened criminal probes into Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’s mayor for obstructing federal enforcement. These moves have provoked mass resignations of U.S. attorneys and public outrage.

It highlights that, despite public claims of halting arms exports in mid‑2025, Germany continued to authorize and deliver military materials and technology used in the war, including tank components, submarines, and small arms. The report reveals that legal distinctions in German export law—between war weapons and military goods, or between defensive and offensive equipment—allowed the Merz government to maintain exports while appearing to impose restrictions. Investigations by NGOs such as the ECCHR suggest that German‑supplied weapons were used in operations that violated international humanitarian law, including the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza.

The father had previously been removed from the U.S. and reentered illegally, according to DHS. Agents removed them from a parked car; the family’s attorney claims agents smashed the car windows in the driveway and prevented the father from handing the child to her mother, who was inside the home with other family members. Both have active asylum claims and no final removal orders. Within hours, the pair was transferred to Texas via commercial flight at 8:30 p.m. The family's attorney, Kira Kelley, filed an emergency petition for release around 5:37 p.m. and a motion to halt the transfer shortly after.

Sánchez announced plans to propose measures at the upcoming EU Council meeting to address these problems.

BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology built into modern Windows computers and enabled by default, designed to prevent unauthorized access if a device is locked and powered off. However, Microsoft automatically uploads BitLocker recovery keys to its cloud, making them accessible to the company and, under certain circumstances, to law enforcement. According to Forbes, Microsoft receives an average of 20 requests per year for such recovery keys and sometimes complies.

Specifically, Abascal is accused of praising immigration raids conducted by U.S. authorities ('la migra'), viewing them as a model that could be replicated in Spain to deport large numbers of immigrants. The author frames U.S. anti-immigrant sentiment as rooted in fear among the Anglo-Saxon population of losing control of the state to a rapidly growing Hispanic demographic, which is unmatched by any other ethnic group in terms of population growth and cultural influence.

It embodies the deep connection between the city and its musical heritage. Built from hundreds of donated guitars collected through a citywide Guitar Amnesty, the work transforms these instruments—some pristine, others worn or broken—into a striking wooden pavilion that resonates with the collective memory of Manchester’s music scene. The sculpture goes beyond symbolism: it actively produces sound. A wind-activated system plucks the embedded guitar strings, allowing the structure to play itself in response to changes in the weather. Thus, the artwork becomes a living instrument, performing an ever-shifting symphony of subtle tones. 

Visitors are encouraged to step inside the sculpture, surrounded by layers of history embedded in each guitar, from early lessons to forgotten gigs.

The photos were taken in remote areas including Crater Lake in Oregon, Mount Baker, and California’s Bristlecone pine forests. Each picture represents hours of preparation, patience, and technical precision. Working through long, cold nights, Johnson adjusts his camera settings in total darkness using long exposures to gather as much starlight as possible. The unpredictability of the aurora means constant adaptation to capture its brief, shifting patterns of light.

K. had claimed 'combatant privilege,' arguing that his alleged actions were those of a Ukrainian soldier targeting enemy infrastructure amid war with Russia. The BGH ruled that this argument does not apply because the Nord Stream pipelines are considered civilian infrastructure and that covert operations without clear state affiliation, such as uniforms or formal orders, are excluded from combatant immunity under international law. 

The court confirmed that Serhii K. will face prosecution in Germany for violating the country’s internal security and sovereignty. He may also be investigated for war crimes due to the civilian nature of the target.

Bilt Cash introduces a separate rewards currency that cardholders earn at 4% on all non-housing purchases and an additional $50 in Bilt Cash for every 25,000 Bilt points accumulated in a calendar year. However, most Bilt Cash expires at the end of each year, with only $100 rolling over. The program lets users redeem Bilt Cash for 19 different 'coupon-like' benefits, ranging from point accelerators to small monthly credits for services such as Lyft, Grubhub, Walgreens, or hotel stays. These offers have varying restrictions, including usage limits, expiration dates, and membership tiers. The most valuable redemptions are considered the 1X points accelerator — which costs $200 Bilt Cash and applies to $5,000 in everyday spending — and the ability to unlock rewards on rent payments, where $30 in Bilt Cash allows users to earn points on $1,000 of rent.

The CRFB identifies six possible crisis scenarios stemming from unchecked debt growth: an austerity crisis marked by forced spending cuts and steep tax hikes that could cause a deep recession; a financial crisis triggered by collapsing investor confidence and soaring interest rates; an inflation crisis resulting from excessive money printing; a currency crisis involving a sharp decline in the dollar’s global value; a default crisis, though improbable, that would devastate international markets; and a gradual crisis characterized by long-term stagnation similar to ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropkick Murphys Express Support for Former Officer Michael Fanone After He Wears Band Shirt at Jack Smith Hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 22, 2026, former D.C.

Immediately after an incident, prioritize safety by moving out of danger, taking deep breaths to stay centered, and documenting the scene thoroughly with photos of damage, surroundings, road conditions, and involved parties. Gather witness contacts, exchange information if others are involved, and consider filing a police report for significant cases. Mindful documentation includes compiling photos, a timely written account, reports, repair estimates, receipts, and notes on disrupted routines or extra costs, which streng]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guide-to-handling-bike-damage-and-claims-as-a-mindful-urban-cyclist</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guide-to-handling-bike-damage-and-claims-as-a-mindful-urban-cyclist</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 07:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guide to Booking Preferred Hotels & Resorts with Points via I Prefer, Choice Privileges, and Citi ThankYou Transfers]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article from Frequent Miler serves as a comprehensive resource for travelers interested in redeeming points at Preferred Hotels & Resorts properties. Many of these independent luxury and boutique hotels can be booked using points, either through the hotel group's own I Prefer rewards program, Choice Privileges (via a partnership), or both. The author highlights transfer options for Citi ThankYou points holders with eligible cards like the Citi Strata Premier or Elite, allowing transfers at 1:2 to Choice Privileges or a favorable 1:4 ratio to I Prefer. Due to the higher multiplier, I Prefer redemptions often provide better value when a hotel accepts both programs, though exceptions exist depending on specific pricing.

To help users, the post features an updated interactive map and a searchable table listing points-bookable hotels, including details such as required I Prefer or Choice points, estimated Citi points needed after transfers, 'starting at' cash rates, and calculated cen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guide-to-booking-preferred-hotels-resorts-with-points-via-i-prefer-choice-privileges-and-citi-thankyou-transfers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/guide-to-booking-preferred-hotels-resorts-with-points-via-i-prefer-choice-privileges-and-citi-thankyou-transfers</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau’s Relationship Reportedly Moving Toward Family Plans]]></title><description><![CDATA[Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been romantically linked since July of last year.

Sources claim that Perry is interested in taking the relationship to the next level, including discussions of marriage and starting a family together. Insiders say both Perry and Trudeau are committed to each other and view the relationship as significantly different from their previous ones. Perry reportedly feels a sense of destiny in meeting Trudeau, and with her desire to expand her family becoming more urgent, she sees him as a suitable partner at this stage in her life.

On Truth Social, he specifically targeted The New York Times/Siena College poll, which reported his approval rating at around 40% with 56% disapproval, claiming it was skewed toward Democrats and vowing to include it in an existing lawsuit against the newspaper while demanding preservation of their internal polling records. He also highlighted an American Research Group poll showing an even lower 35% approval and over 60% disapproval, broadening his criticism to include mainstream media, television networks, and even some conservative outlets for allegedly suppressing positive surveys.

The investigation claims that Trump’s wealth has grown primarily through overseas business ventures, licensing deals, and particularly from cryptocurrency investments. While continuing to deny any direct involvement with the Trump Organization, Trump has been accused of intertwining his political influence with private business interests. The report notes new real estate developments in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, both following significant diplomatic or policy interactions with those nations. For instance, the Trump Organization reportedly announced major Saudi projects soon after the president hosted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House.

Effective immediately as of January 2026, it is no longer possible to book Emirates first-class award tickets for children under nine years old, aligning more closely with Emirates' own policies. Starting February 18, 2026, bookings for Emirates first class will require at least Qantas Silver elite status or higher, excluding entry-level Bronze members entirely. Additionally, from March 31, 2026, Qantas will implement a new distance-based award chart specifically for Emirates redemptions, resulting in increases across cabins. Most first-class awards will rise by approximately 20%; for example, the popular fifth-freedom route from New York to Milan (over 4,000 miles one-way) will jump from 123,100 to 147,800 Qantas points one-way.

A. Lawrence claims that Republicans plan to pass the SAVE Act in the Senate at the last minute before the 2026 midterms, requiring proof of U.S. citizenship via documents like birth certificates or passports for voter registration. It argues this would disproportionately affect approximately 69 million American women who changed their names after marriage or divorce, as their current legal names often do not match birth certificates, leading to unverifiable status and inability to vote or update registrations. The piece highlights long processing times (weeks to months) for corrected documents, making last-minute fixes impossible, and portrays the timing as a deliberate strategy to suppress women's votes. It connects this to broader themes of control over women's autonomy, including abortion restrictions and historical conservative efforts against gender equality.

The image quickly circulated, drawing attention not only from social media users but also from Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show,” which posted a satirical caption referencing the alleged annexation of “Gangreneland.” White House officials have attempted to downplay the concerns, attributing the bruise to Trump’s frequent aspirin use, which can lead to visible bruising, and a minor accidental bump against a table. Trump himself briefly addressed the mark, stating he used cream and “clipped it.” The incident has reignited discussions about the president’s regular aspirin intake, a practice he claims maintains “nice thin blood flowing through his heart.” Medical experts, however, caution against high-dose aspirin use due to potential side effects like stomach ulcers and brain]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-hand-bruise-sparks-speculation-and-jon-stewart-s-satire</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-hand-bruise-sparks-speculation-and-jon-stewart-s-satire</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 23:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Warns of US Retaliation Against European Sales of American Assets Amid Greenland Deal Tensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump, speaking in a Fox Business interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 22, 2026, threatened 'big retaliation' if European countries sell off US assets like bonds and stocks in response to his earlier tariff threats tied to Greenland. Trump emphasized that the US holds 'all the cards' but did not detail potential countermeasures. This statement follows his recent abandonment of plans to impose escalating tariffs (starting at 10% and rising to 25%) on goods from eight European nations—Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland—to pressure them over US desires for greater control or access to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory. The tariff reversal came after negotiations led to a 'framework deal' with NATO involvement, which includes stationing US missiles in Greenland, securing mineral rights to counter Chinese influence, and strengthening NATO's Arctic presence to address Russian and Chinese interests. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-warns-of-us-retaliation-against-european-sales-of-american-assets-amid-greenland-deal-tensions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-warns-of-us-retaliation-against-european-sales-of-american-assets-amid-greenland-deal-tensions</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Theo Von Agrees with Bernie Sanders on Trump's Authoritarian Approach During Podcast Discussion on Immigration and Politics]]></title><description><![CDATA[Comedian and podcaster Theo Von, known for his large audience including many young male listeners who lean Republican, recently hosted independent Sen.

Sanders strongly criticized a fatal shooting incident involving ICE agent and 37-year-old U.S. citizen Renee Good, describing Trump's immigration enforcement as a form of domestic military operation and intimidation, emblematic of 'Trumpism.'

The companion traveler earns redeemable points, qualifies for elite status qualifying activity, and receives the same elite benefits as the primary passenger. For years, despite official terms limiting the fare to one-way or round-trip travel, Alaska permitted flexible bookings including multiple segments, stopovers, and open-jaws in practice.

However, it is a temporary state rather than a character flaw, and recovery involves gradual, realistic steps rather than sudden fixes. Key hurdles include low energy and motivation; the article emphasizes starting with small actions—like getting out of bed, opening a window, or completing one task—because waiting for motivation rarely works, and even minor progress can weaken depression's hold. Cognitively, depression distorts neutral events into personal failures, so gently questioning these thoughts—distinguishing facts from feelings—and considering positive overthinking can help. Isolation worsens the condition, making connection vital, even through low-effort interactions like sharing a laugh or sending a message, as human contact counters the brain's insistence on loneliness.

Despite decades of progress, including maps of brain networks active during awareness and tools to detect consciousness in impaired patients, no consensus exists on its definition or mechanisms.

Many Russians now view the war as defensive against perceived Western hostility, fostering widespread anti-Western sentiment and national consolidation. Pride in Russia's resilience amid sanctions, combined with economic growth despite heavy restrictions, has boosted optimism and trust in the nation's viability. The war has spurred technological innovation, reinforced the social contract of state-provided services, low taxes, and public investment, which Russians see as superior to Western models.

Due to significant disparities in military resources, officials anticipate that American forces could seize key land and sea positions within two days to a week. Rather than attempting conventional defense, the strategy shifts to unconventional, insurgency-style tactics inspired by Afghan resistance against Soviet and later U.S.-led forces, including ambushes, sabotage, drone operations, hit-and-run attacks, and improvised explosives. The focus would be on small, mobile units and reservists inflicting ongoing casualties to make occupation costly and difficult. General Jennie Carignan, Chief of the Defence Staff, has publicly outlined plans to expand a volunteer reserve force to over 400,000 members, who could be mobilized for armed resistance or disruptions if the U.S. assumes an occupying role. Preparations include a three-month timeline]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-models-hypothetical-guerrilla-response-to-potential-u-s-invasion-scenario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-models-hypothetical-guerrilla-response-to-potential-u-s-invasion-scenario</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Proposes 'Peace Council' to Replace the United Nations Structure]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced the creation of the 'Peace Council,' an international organization designed to rival the United Nations. The initiative, formally unveiled during the World Economic Forum in Davos, aims to redefine how countries participate in global diplomacy. Member states may join the new organization freely for a temporary three-year term, but a permanent seat requires a payment of one billion dollars. This financial requirement creates a hierarchy among nations, contradicting the UN’s principle of sovereign equality. Several Western countries, including France, Norway, and Sweden, have rejected the proposal, arguing that it undermines the multilateral system established in 1945. China reaffirmed its support for the UN and criticized the move as destabilizing to international diplomatic balance.

Braided cables, often constructed from woven nylon or polyester, are known for their longevity and resistance to fraying and bending. The textured weave provides a firm grip and prevents tangling, making them ideal for travel and demanding work environments. Magnetic charging solutions, such as those offered by Statik, often leverage this design to enhance exterior strength without adding excessive weight. In contrast, silicone cables offer exceptional flexibility and heat resistance, remaining soft even in cold temperatures and minimizing the risk of kinking. Their smooth, rubber-like surface, while comfortable and easy to handle, can be prone to attracting dust and lint. Both types of cables typically utilize copper or aluminum wiring for electrical performance, which remains consistent regardless of the outer material.

She recalled how Elordi would often stay nearby during filming, observing her character, which she found initially unsettling but soon became accustomed to. Elordi, 28, echoed her sentiments, calling it a 'mutual obsession' and praising Robbie as an elite actor. The two actors’ on-set rituals, including playing Kate Bush’s song “Wuthering Heights” on the Moors, helped them embody the story’s intense emotions of love and longing.

Machado described the event as a historic milestone, asserting that Venezuela's liberation from dictatorship paves the way for similar freedom in Cuba and Nicaragua. She emphasized that with US support, the Americas could become free of communism, dictatorship, and related threats for the first time in history.

Approximately 13,500 such notices were planned for 2026, with many being annual renewals from previous years and no immediate impact during peacetime.

She described how an ICE agent removed Liam from the car, brought him to the front door, and instructed him to knock and ask to be let in so agents could see who else was inside, calling it the use of a small child as bait. Another adult at the home reportedly begged to take care of Liam so he would not be taken into detention, but that request was refused.

High-quality beans are characterized by uniform size, consistent color, appropriate moisture levels, and minimal defects, all influenced by factors such as growing altitude, soil composition, microclimate, and origin region. For example, beans from higher altitudes often develop more complex and vibrant flavor profiles with bright acidity and fruity or floral notes, while Arabica varieties generally offer smoother, more nuanced tastes compared to the stronger, more bitter Robusta.

Specifically, there were 47% more sellers than buyers—equating to roughly 631,000 additional sellers—with the number of active buyers dropping to just 1.34 million, the lowest figure in Redfin’s 12-year dataset and comparable to early pandemic lows in April 2020. This imbalance stems from buyers retreating due to persistently elevated home prices, mortgage rates hovering around 6%, recent layoffs, and broader economic and political uncertainties. The trend marks a complete reversal from the heated 2021 market, characterized by frequent bidding wars and buyers outnumbering sellers; the scales began tipping noticeably after February 2024.

Observations indicate that thermal tension or pre-existing cracks were unlikely contributors, leaving possible welding defects or steel processing issues as likely causes. Beyond this individual failure, the article highlights broader issues with Spain's high-speed rail network, which was designed for lower traffic volumes and lighter trains. The network is now operating under stress from heavier trains and increased traffic, raising maintenance challenges that may be economically and operationally unsustainable.

The bank estimates that tech companies and others will spend around $1 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures, including data centers, chips, and power grid enhancements, yet there is currently little tangible benefit or evidence of payoff. Drawing from interviews with Goldman Sachs economists, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, and infrastructure experts, the report highlights concerns about whether scaling training data further will resolve core issues, as data quality matters more than quantity and high-quality sources may be scarce. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, expressed strong skepticism, noting that generative AI remains unreliable for even basic tasks like summarization, often producing nonsensical results, and cited internal tests where AI was six times more expensive than manu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minneapolis General Strike Inspires Solidarity Actions in Over 120 Cities Nationwide]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Minneapolis General Strike, initially organized by the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation and the Minnesota AFL-CIO, is rapidly gaining national attention. Workers across Minnesota have planned a 'Day of Truth and Freedom' strike, with thousands expected to participate in the Twin Cities. This local strike has inspired solidarity actions in at least 120 cities across the United States, signaling a growing labor movement against ICE operations in Minneapolis. Payday Report has been tracking these solidarity events and has provided an interactive map to visualize the nationwide participation. The movement reflects collaboration among labor unions, community organizations, and immigrant rights groups, aiming to create a model for collective action against federal raids. According to CWA Local 7520 President Keiran Knutson, tens of thousands of workers could join in Minnesota, with similar mobilizations appearing in other regions.

In the third quarter of 2025, the top 1% of households owned 31.7% of all U.S. wealth, the largest share recorded since tracking began in 1989. This group held approximately $55 trillion in assets, roughly matching the combined wealth of the bottom 90% of Americans. The trend highlights a persistent K-shaped economic recovery, where low- and middle-income households experience stalled or slowed wealth growth, while the richest pull further ahead. Experts attribute the widening gap to several factors, including surging stock market gains driven by investments in artificial intelligence, which disproportionately benefit wealthier households with higher stock ownership. In contrast, middle-income families have more wealth tied to real estate, where price growth has moderated. Uneven wage increases also play a role, with higher-income groups seeing stronger ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/top-1-of-us-households-reach-record-31-7-share-of-wealth-in-q3-2025-per-federal-reserve-data</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/top-1-of-us-households-reach-record-31-7-share-of-wealth-in-q3-2025-per-federal-reserve-data</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Drops Greenland Tariff Threats After Davos Speech and NATO Talks, But Tensions Persist with European Leaders]]></title><description><![CDATA[In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2026, US President Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the US to acquire Greenland from Denmark, framing it as a reasonable transaction due to historical US military support to Europe and criticizing allies for not contributing enough to NATO. He claimed the US had been wrong to 'give back' Greenland after World War II (a historical inaccuracy, as Greenland was never US territory) and mocked several leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump ruled out using military force to take Greenland but insisted on negotiations for outright ownership. He also referenced a quip that without the US, Europeans would be 'speaking German,' which drew criticism for being insulting and inaccurate, especially in multilingual Switzerland. Initially, Trump threatened 10% tariffs starting February 1 on goods from eight European countries (including Denmark, Germany, France, UK, and others) opposing his Greenland ambitions.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-drops-greenland-tariff-threats-after-davos-speech-and-nato-talks-but-tensions-persist-with-european-leaders</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-drops-greenland-tariff-threats-after-davos-speech-and-nato-talks-but-tensions-persist-with-european-leaders</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kyiv Faces Mass Exodus Amid Russian Strikes on Energy Infrastructure and Severe Winter Blackouts]]></title><description><![CDATA[In January 2026, Kyiv experienced intense Russian missile and drone attacks targeting energy infrastructure, resulting in widespread power, heating, and water outages across the capital and nearby regions like Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials reported that up to 80% of Kyiv lost electricity, with over a million residents affected and many buildings without heat during temperatures plummeting to -18°C in a prolonged cold snap. Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that around 600,000 people had fled the city in January alone, based on mobile phone data, out of a pre-war population of roughly 3 million, equating to a 20-25% decline. Authorities urged further evacuations to avoid a humanitarian crisis, while considering shutting down the metro to conserve power.

Bruley stated that this behavior is part of a broader pattern of civil rights complaints received from the community, noting that if trained officers who understand constitutional rights are being targeted, it raises serious concerns for the general public. He emphasized that these incidents are not isolated, with other law enforcement chiefs confirming similar experiences with their off-duty officers.

It emphasizes the importance of balancing creativity with practicality, noting that socks function as both fashion statements and wearable objects subject to stretch, motion, and structural limitations. A good sock design, according to the piece, focuses on visual clarity, durability, and adaptability to the fabric's behavior. Clear, bold patterns outperform intricate artwork, since socks are viewed mostly from a distance, and small details can disappear or distort when worn.

The text highlights several effective design approaches such as using minimal line icons, micro-patterns, and directional stripes to create visually balanced and functional results. It points out that large motifs with ample negative space or abstract color blocks can conceal distortion well, while simple botanical silhouettes and restrained typography add personality without losing legibility.

According to Bessent, sanctions intentionally targeted Iran’s access to global financial networks and oil revenue, cutting it off from foreign reserves. By December 2025, the Iranian rial had lost over 80% of its value, triggering inflation exceeding 40% and dramatic spikes in food prices, which fueled public unrest.

Despite this economic hardship, the article argues that the sanctions have also strengthened Iran’s determination and pushed it toward greater cooperation with adversaries of the United States. Iran has adopted methods to circumvent restrictions, such as operating a 'ghost fleet' of tankers to continue crude exports—mostly to China, which now purchases about 90% of Iranian oil at discounted prices.

The document, attributed to Acting Director Todd Lyons, was shared with Senator Richard Blumenthal by whistleblowers represented by Whistleblower Aid. It marks a significant shift from prior DHS policy, which traditionally required judicial warrants signed by judges for home entry. The memo cites guidance from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of General Counsel stating that neither the Constitution nor immigration laws prohibit this practice. The directive specifies that ICE officers must identify themselves, announce their purpose, allow time for compliance, and generally avoid raids between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., using only reasonable force if necessary.

Rather than reacting defensively, the EU should proactively use the crisis to encourage Iceland and Norway to revive their EU membership bids. In Iceland, the government has committed to a plebiscite by 2027 on resuming EU accession talks, and recent polls show a relative majority supporting membership for the first time since 2015, driven by fears of NATO unreliability under U.S. assertiveness. In Norway, support for EU accession has reached historic highs since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with a majority favoring a new referendum and the Conservative Party framing membership as a strategic security necessity amid potential transatlantic strains.

The article highlights this as evidence of Trump's normalization of authoritarian rhetoric, set against his aggressive diplomatic stance, including threats toward Europe, Canada, Greenland, and Iceland. Trump's Davos speech focused on pushing for U.S. control of Greenland for security reasons, confusing it with Iceland at times, and threatening tariffs on European allies opposing the move.

He described the current global situation as a 'rupture, not a transition,' where economic tools like tariffs and supply chains are increasingly weaponized, and major powers act with fewer constraints. Carney urged middle powers, such as Canada, to abandon complacency and adopt a 'value-based realism'—a principled yet pragmatic approach grounded in human rights, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the prohibition of force except under the UN Charter.

The first transaction generated $500 million, with $300 million routed through Qatari banks to Venezuela's interim government under Delcy Rodríguez. These funds aim to stabilize the devaluing bolívar by injecting them into the currency market. The deal stems from Trump's announced plan for Venezuela to supply 30-50 million barrels to the US at market prices (around $56 per barrel), potentially worth up to $2.8 billion, shifting from discounted sales. The US oversees the process as leverage over Venezuela's politics and economy, with plans for American companies to invest in rehabilitating the nation's oil infrastructure amid its vast reserves exceeding 300 billion barrels.

Enamel pins are not digital prints; they involve constraints like minimum line widths for metal formation, color separation requirements, plating effects, and tight tolerances. This article outlines ten frequent mistakes made by designers and provides clear fixes. Key issues include using lines that are too thin for metal durability, cramming excessive detail into tiny 1-1.5 inch sizes leading to visual clutter, incorporating tiny or unsuitable text that becomes illegible, overloading with too many colors or poor separation increasing complexity and cost, relying on gradients and soft shadows that do not translate to flat enamel fills, overlooking how metal plating color affects overall contrast and mood, failing to include a defined border or safety margins causing uneven edges, creating low-]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study Shows Persistent Villous Atrophy in Many Adult Celiac Patients on Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet, But Lamina Propria Immune Normalization Occurs]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent study led by Aida Fiz López, published in Clinical and Experimental Immunology, investigated why many adult celiac disease patients continue to show intestinal mucosal damage despite years of strict gluten-free diet adherence.

Firming products primarily work on the skin's surface and upper layers by enhancing hydration, improving texture for better light reflection, and supporting elasticity, resulting in plumper, smoother, and more resilient-looking skin. The article emphasizes that true 'all-over lift' comes from better hydration to reduce crepiness, smoother texture, and gradual resilience rather than dramatic physical lifting. A simple morning routine should include a gentle cleanse, a lightweight firming serum or treatment, a hydrating moisturizer, and most importantly, daily broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent UV damage, which accelerates loss of firmness.

This might lead users to believe they can earn rewards when booking actual Southwest flights through the portal. However, this is not the case. The rewards are only applicable when purchasing Rapid Rewards points directly, typically via Points.com, and explicitly exclude purchases of flights, hotels, cars, vacations, cruises, or gift cards.

The card, once celebrated for its simplicity and generous travel perks, now offers a wide array of complicated credits and coupons. Greg explains that determining the card’s value depends on how effectively a cardholder uses those benefits, particularly new additions such as The Edit travel credits, StubHub rebates, Lyft and DoorDash credits, and entertainment subscriptions like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. 

To assess whether the card is worth keeping, Greg introduces a personal evaluation method using his 'bundling' approach. Instead of pricing each coupon individually, he groups related benefits—like travel perks or miscellaneous lifestyle credits—and estimates how much he would realistically pay for those bundles. In his own analysis, he values the $300 travel credit at $285, travel-related benef]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluating-the-real-value-of-the-795-chase-sapphire-reserve-card</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluating-the-real-value-of-the-795-chase-sapphire-reserve-card</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oxfam Reports Record Surge in Billionaire Wealth to $18.3 Trillion in 2025, Linked to Rising Political Influence and Global Inequality]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to a new Oxfam report released on January 19, 2026, coinciding with the World Economic Forum in Davos, billionaire wealth surged by more than 16% in 2025—three times faster than the average growth over the previous five years—reaching a historic high of $18.3 trillion. This represents an 81% increase since 2020. The collective wealth grew by $2.5 trillion in 2025 alone, nearly matching the total wealth of the bottom half of humanity (4.1 billion people) and enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. The number of billionaires exceeded 3,000 for the first time, with Elon Musk becoming the first to surpass half a trillion dollars. The report, titled 'Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power,' highlights how this extreme wealth concentration enables the super-rich to gain disproportionate political power, including through tax cuts for the wealthy, weakened corporate regulations, and media ownership. Billionaires are estimated to be 4,000]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oxfam-reports-record-surge-in-billionaire-wealth-to-18-3-trillion-in-2025-linked-to-rising-political-influence-and-global-inequality</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oxfam-reports-record-surge-in-billionaire-wealth-to-18-3-trillion-in-2025-linked-to-rising-political-influence-and-global-inequality</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 09:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vintage Covers of Flying Magazine from the 1950s]]></title><description><![CDATA[Flying magazine, first published in 1927, stands as the world's most widely read aviation publication and a key resource for pilots and aviation enthusiasts.

A recent systematic review published in Advances in Bamboo Science analyzed decades of research, including human trials, animal studies, and lab work, on bamboo shoots and derived compounds. Key findings indicate that bamboo shoots are rich in dietary fiber, such as cellulose and lignin, which supports digestion, gut health, regularity, and possibly beneficial gut bacteria. Early human studies suggest benefits for metabolic health, including better blood sugar regulation and improved cholesterol levels, which could lower risks for diabetes and heart disease. Lab research reveals antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce cellular stress and chronic inflammation.

The unrest, which involved thousands of participants, turned violent with reports of smashed windows, property damage, and clashes with police. Authorities deployed riot gear, water cannons, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets after protesters allegedly threw stones and fireworks; no injuries were reported. The protests were fueled by Trump's persistent threats to acquire Greenland from Denmark for US security reasons, including refusing to rule out military action and proposing tariffs on European countries supporting Denmark. In response, European leaders like Ursula von der Leyen criticized the tariff threats and asserted Europe's role in Arctic security.

He claims that the people of Greenland, described derogatorily as living on a 'desolate ice ball,' are being paid to reject a supposed generous American offer of $100,000 per person. Kimble argues that no one would turn down such a large sum out of pure principle, implying the protests lack authenticity. He advocates for Greenland's annexation, noting its population of over 56,000 is about one-tenth that of Wyoming, and absurdly suggests it should therefore receive Senate representation comparable to California's 40 million residents despite the constitutional two-senators-per-state rule. Kimble accuses Democrat operatives, specifically naming George Soros, of bribing the protesters to interfere and prevent the people from freely deciding on the $100,000 offer.

Unlike standard doors, fire doors are constructed with solid cores, fire-resistant materials, and intumescent seals that expand under heat to seal gaps, typically resisting fire for 30 to 60 minutes. This containment limits damage, reduces smoke inhalation risks, and helps maintain clearer escape routes, especially in critical areas like stairwells, hallways, and landings in multi-storey homes. The article highlights how fire doors protect escape paths by keeping temperatures lower and visibility better for longer periods. Modern advancements include fire-rated glass panels that allow natural light to pass between rooms without compromising safety, as these panels are tested to withstand high temperatures and prevent flame passage.

Describing the island as a 'piece of ice, cold and poorly located' essential for global security, Trump criticized NATO allies for lacking support on the issue and wrongly attributed a recent US stock market dip to 'Iceland,' claiming it had cost the country money. He made similar errors the day before in a White House briefing. Despite the gaffes, Trump called for immediate negotiations to gain 'right, title and ownership' of Greenland, insisting the US would not use force but warning that refusal would be remembered.

This tool offers various defensive measures, such as imposing punitive tariffs, refusing patent recognition, and excluding certain US products or companies from the European market. However, the article argues that the ACI is merely a toolbox of retaliatory options rather than a decisive weapon. The real potential 'bazooka' lies in Europe's massive holdings of US Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets.

He claimed the U.S. dollar has weakened by 28% over the past five years, describing inflation as a 'scam' that allows politicians to obscure real economic impacts. Using a personal example, Scaramucci noted that his parents purchased a house in 1962 for $16,000, equivalent to 457 ounces of gold at $35 per ounce. Today, a similar house is valued at $750,000, but at current gold prices of around $3,300 per ounce, it equates to only 227 ounces—demonstrating a loss in real value despite nominal gains. He emphasized that people often mistake larger dollar figures for increased wealth, when in reality the currency's value has declined.

European buyers are avoiding Israeli fruits, while the Houthi blockade in the Red Sea has caused major shipping disruptions to Asian markets. Together, these pressures have left Russia as one of the few remaining destinations for Israeli produce — creating what one farmer calls an 'alliance of the boycotted.'

However, escalating tensions between the US and European allies over President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland—accompanied by tariff threats against Denmark and other NATO members—shifted the focus away from Ukraine-related agreements. According to reports from Axios and the Financial Times, the dispute overshadowed preparations, leading to the postponement of any formal signing or major announcement involving Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and European leaders. US officials emphasized that no specific date had been fixed and that the plan required further refinements.

This stems from his escalating efforts to acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he claims is essential for U.S. national security in the Arctic. Trump has refused to rule out military force and recently sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, stating he 'no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace' after not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, which was awarded to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado. Critics link this to perceived instability, with some describing Trump as 'unfit to lead,' 'out of control,' or 'extremely mentally ill.'

The resort boasts exceptional views of Mount Otemanu, particularly from Premium Otemanu View overwater bungalows with plunge pools, which the reviewer described as one of their all-time favorite rooms. Standard overwater bungalows can often be booked using Marriott Bonvoy points (around 71,000–77,500 per night) or 85K free night certificates, providing excellent value far exceeding typical valuations for Marriott redemptions. The grounds feel brand new, with complimentary amenities like clear-bottomed kayaks and paddle boards.

Violent clashes between protesters and police in Zurich resulted in property damage and the use of water cannons, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The situation has escalated Trump's public spats with European leaders, with Ursula von der Leyen criticizing his tariffs threats and highlighting Europe’s Arctic policing capabilities. The president has doubled down on his Greenland ambitions, threatening tariffs and ruling out backtracking.

He referenced Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's symbolic regifting of her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump as an example. Newsom urged European lawmakers to 'stop being complicit,' 'have a backbone,' and stand united rather than allowing Trump to 'play folks for fools.' He likened Trump to a 'T-Rex,' stating one must either 'mate with him or he devours you.'

Business leaders expressed frustration with perpetual pilot projects that fail to scale due to poor data quality, undefined processes, and weak governance. Experts like PwC's Mohamed Kande emphasized the need for top-down strategies focusing on high-impact use cases that directly affect revenue, costs, or customer experience, integrating AI into core business operations with clear productivity metrics. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned that if AI benefits remain concentrated in big tech, it risks becoming a bubble rather than a productive revolution, stressing democratization for gains in health, education, public sectors, and SMEs.

It highlights Greenland's strategic value, rooted in WWII-era bases for Atlantic protection and Arctic weather intelligence, and post-war US military presence via agreements. Denmark is portrayed as a colonial power that has gradually granted autonomy, including a 31-seat parliament (Inatsisartut) and EU exit in 1985. The political scene features five parties: the pro-Denmark Democratic Party (10 seats), nationalist Naleraq (8 seats, fast independence), ecosocialist Inuit Ataqatigiit (7 seats, gradual independence), center-left Siumut, and conservative unionist Atassut (2 seats).

This shift occurred as the EU drastically reduced Russian gas imports following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, dropping from 50 percent to 12 percent, with a full ban on Russian gas phased in. Projections indicate that by 2030, nearly half of the EU's gas could come from the US, representing up to 80 percent of its LNG imports, according to data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). This growing dependency creates a significant geopolitical risk, especially as transatlantic relations deteriorate under US President Donald Trump.

Melasma, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is often aggravated by UV exposure or tanning beds and can appear as brown or gray spots that sometimes itch or irritate the skin.

Tana recalled a moment when a pharmacist asked about the stains on her face, which made her more conscious of sun protection. She now takes precautions daily and never goes out without sunscreen.

The article emphasizes that while chemical treatments and surgeries can offer results, they may cause irritation or long-term damage to the skin barrier. Instead, it promotes chemical-free approaches to maintain youthful, healthy skin through lifestyle changes and natural remedies.

Key lifestyle habits include staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water to keep skin elastic and glowing, eating a balanced diet rich in fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats to combat free radicals and support collagen production, getting sufficient quality sleep for skin cell renewal, and managing stress to prevent premature aging signs.

Natural skincare options from kitchen ingredients are highlighted, such as aloe vera gel for its vitamins C and E that boost collagen and hydrate skin, coconut oil for antioxidant protection and deep moisturization, honey as a humectant to draw]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/natural-methods-to-slow-down-wrinkles-and-support-skin-health</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/natural-methods-to-slow-down-wrinkles-and-support-skin-health</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Far-right influencers sing controversial song at Miami nightclub, prompting firings and bans]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Miami nightclub, Vendome, faced criticism after a group of far-right influencers, including Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate, were filmed singing along to Ye's song containing Nazi references. The event, which occurred on January 17, 2026, also featured some participants making Nazi salutes. The footage circulated widely on social media, sparking outrage from Jewish organizations, elected officials, and the public. The nightclub apologized, condemned antisemitism, and fired three employees while banning the personalities involved. They also implemented stricter content controls and management oversight to prevent similar incidents in the future. The song, which glorifies Hitler and has been banned on multiple streaming platforms, intensified concerns about far-right extremist influence and antisemitic rhetoric. Miami Beach officials emphasized the city’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, condemning the glorification of Nazi ideology.

This precautionary measure comes in response to ongoing large-scale immigration enforcement actions by federal authorities, particularly ICE, in Minnesota, which have sparked significant protests in the Minneapolis area. Defense officials, speaking anonymously, indicated that the troops could be mobilized if President Donald Trump decides to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807—a rarely used law allowing the president to deploy active-duty military forces domestically for law enforcement purposes in cases of rebellion or when local authorities cannot maintain order. The orders follow Trump's recent social media threat to use the Act against what he described as 'professional agitators and insurrectionists' interfering with ICE operations, though he later stated there was no immed]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pentagon-places-1-500-active-duty-soldiers-on-prepare-to-deploy-orders-for-potential-minnesota-mission-amid-immigration-protests</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pentagon-places-1-500-active-duty-soldiers-on-prepare-to-deploy-orders-for-potential-minnesota-mission-amid-immigration-protests</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spanish Court of Auditors Report Highlights PCE's Reliance on Asset Sales to Offset Ongoing Losses (2017-2023)]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to the Spanish Tribunal de Cuentas' 2025 report on political party transparency and the PCE's own annual financial disclosures from 2017 to 2023, the Partido Comunista de España (PCE) has faced persistent financial challenges. Over this seven-year period, the party generated ordinary losses of approximately 1.29 million euros, which it offset by selling historical real estate assets worth 1.56 million euros, with the majority of sales (1.44 million euros) occurring between 2021 and 2023. Without these asset liquidations, the PCE would have recorded unsustainable deficits in its operations. Total ordinary income reached 13.16 million euros, with about 70% classified as private sources and 30% as direct public funding—contrasting sharply with major parties like the PP (83% public) and PSOE (68% public).

The government is reforming the Hydrocarbons Law to introduce Productive Participation Contracts, enabling foreign capital and technology—particularly from US firms like Chevron and ExxonMobil—to revitalize the oil sector and boost production. A key initial step was signing a contract for exporting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), aligning with expressed US interests under Donald Trump in leading Venezuela's energy reactivation. To address social emergencies and high inflation, two new sovereign funds were created: one for direct social protection (supporting workers, health, and education) and another for urgent infrastructure repairs in water, electricity, and roads, both funded by oil revenues.

This deal, finalized in July 2025 after prolonged negotiations, aimed to reduce tariffs on US industrial goods entering the EU market and resolve ongoing trade disputes, including previous US impositions of 15% tariffs on EU exports. The delay serves as a symbolic yet impactful protest against President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose new tariffs on several EU member states—particularly France and Germany—if they do not support US acquisition of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. Lawmakers, including Valerie Hayer from the centrist Renew group, emphasized that suspending approval would pressure American businesses reliant on the European market, describing it as a 'powerful lever.'

Gold remains a reliable and stable investment due to its status as a globally traded commodity, liquidity, and responsiveness to economic conditions like inflation, currency fluctuations, and industrial demand. Higher-karat pieces hold value particularly well, making gold a low-risk option for buyers seeking consistent worth. Diamonds present more challenges: while certified natural diamonds with strong quality, size, and ethical sourcing can retain or appreciate in value, their market is pressured by the widespread adoption of lab-grown alternatives (now around 40% of new carats), leading to greater volatility and lower resale for many stones. Provenance, condition, and certification are critical for diamonds to perform well.

It emphasizes that 'neurodivergent' is not a diagnosis but a descriptive term referring to differences in brain functioning linked to conditions like ADHD or autism. Understanding one’s neurodivergence typically requires multiple approaches rather than a single test or moment of revelation. 

The piece presents six methods for self-exploration. First, online evaluations can serve as a gentle introduction to neurodiversity, though they should not replace professional diagnosis. Second, traveling mindfully can reveal sensory sensitivities, executive functioning differences, or emotional regulation challenges—travel disruptions often magnify these traits. Third, research and reading first-hand accounts offer a grounded understanding of how neurodivergence expresses itself in daily life.

Trump claims that, despite his efforts in ending eight wars, he was denied the award, which he now cites as justification for no longer feeling bound to pursue purely peaceful policies. While he maintains that peace remains a goal, he emphasizes prioritizing actions that he deems beneficial for the United States. The letter, reportedly shared with other European governments, also questions Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland, framing it as a strategic issue for NATO and global security.

The article highlights ongoing tensions between the United States and Denmark, which administers Greenland as an autonomous territory. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland for its critical Arctic position, vast mineral resources, and role in missile defense and surveillance. The U.S. already maintains the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland under a defense agreement with Denmark, supporting NATO missions for missile warning and space surveillance.

It could become a central topic at the upcoming 2026 BRICS summit in India, marking a significant step toward reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar in international commerce.

The US president shared an AI-generated image depicting himself and senior political allies planting an American flag on Greenlandic soil, labelled as a future US territory. Speaking to reporters, Trump questioned Denmark’s sovereignty over the island, arguing that historical claims do not constitute legitimate ownership and insisting that Denmark lacks the capacity to protect Greenland from geopolitical threats.

Trump linked his Greenland ambitions to broader security concerns, repeatedly citing NATO and his own role in pressuring alliance members to increase defence spending. He claimed credit for strengthening NATO and said he had recently discussed Greenland with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, with plans for further talks involving international leaders in Davos.

This shift implies that Iran now views the risks of continued strategic patience as exceeding those of proactive measures in certain scenarios. The term 'objective signs' remains intentionally vague, potentially encompassing intelligence evaluations, military deployments, cyber operations, or even hostile political statements, allowing broad interpretation.

The probe, prompted by multiple complaints, revealed that Betar engaged in bias-motivated assaults, threats, and harassment targeting Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, and Jewish New Yorkers, particularly those involved in protests related to Israel and Palestine. Evidence included physical intimidation, assaults (such as striking a woman wearing a keffiyeh and celebrating it online), promoting violence by encouraging members to bring weapons to protests, circulating content celebrating violence against Palestinians, and attempting to intimidate protesters through actions like referencing deadly operations in Lebanon. The group also faced criticism for compiling and submitting lists of pro-Palestinian campus activists to the Trump administration for potential dep]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/new-york-attorney-general-reaches-settlement-with-far-right-pro-israel-group-betar-us-over-harassment-allegations-leading-to-cessation-of-state-operations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/new-york-attorney-general-reaches-settlement-with-far-right-pro-israel-group-betar-us-over-harassment-allegations-leading-to-cessation-of-state-operations</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inventor Develops a Drone Umbrella That Hovers Above Users]]></title><description><![CDATA[John Tse, an inventive maker, has created a unique flying umbrella that autonomously hovers above a person, providing protection from rain or sunlight. The device uses small propellers, sensors, and tracking software to follow the user as they move, eliminating the need to hold a traditional umbrella. While functional, the drone umbrella is far from practical due to its noise, weight, and mechanical complexity. Tse’s creation is more an exploration of playful technology than a serious replacement for everyday rain gear. The project raises intriguing questions about the future of everyday objects and how they might move independently, blending functionality with whimsy. The invention has been described as inventive, unnecessary, and charming, offering a glimpse into a potential future where technology merges entertainment with utility.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/inventor-develops-a-drone-umbrella-that-hovers-above-users</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/inventor-develops-a-drone-umbrella-that-hovers-above-users</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rising Influence of Streetwear Illustration on Contemporary Design]]></title><description><![CDATA[Streetwear illustration has rapidly evolved from an expressive art form rooted in urban subcultures to a prominent influence on mainstream design. Originating from graffiti and street art – often created without permission and imbued with a rebellious spirit – these bold designs have infiltrated various areas of the design world. Initially seen on clothing and accessories, streetwear illustration now shapes graphic hoodies, jeans, and broader design trends, resonating strongly with younger audiences. 

The impact extends beyond aesthetics; streetwear illustration functions as a powerful visual language communicating cultural values, attitudes, and emotions. Designers are drawing inspiration from the bold typography, layering techniques, and symbolic representations commonly found in street art. This influence is evident in posters, album covers, branding initiatives, and digital content, enabling brands to connect with younger demographics by cultivating a sense of creativity, communit]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rising-influence-of-streetwear-illustration-on-contemporary-design</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rising-influence-of-streetwear-illustration-on-contemporary-design</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Office Depot and OfficeMax Offer $15 Instant Discount on $300+ Mastercard Gift Card Purchases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Frequent Miler reports that Office Depot and OfficeMax have relaunched a recurring limited-time promotion offering customers a $15 instant discount when purchasing $300 or more in Mastercard gift cards. The deal runs from January 18 to January 24, 2026, and is limited to ten transactions per household or business, though local stores may apply their own restrictions. The promotion applies only to in-store purchases, as online orders are processed by a third party that does not qualify for office supply credit card rewards.

This offer has long been a favorite among points and miles enthusiasts. By purchasing three $200 Mastercard gift cards, customers spend $600, receive a $30 discount, and pay $23.85 in activation fees. This results in a small net profit of about $6.15, not including the additional rewards from cards like the Chase Ink Cash, which earns 5x points at office supply stores.

He stated that this snub relieves him of prioritizing peace and allows him to focus on U.S. interests, including demanding 'Complete and Total Control' of Greenland from Denmark. Anne Applebaum criticizes the letter for its poor grammar, factual inaccuracies—such as Trump's false claim of ending wars and denial of historical documents supporting Danish sovereignty over Greenland—and its bizarre obsession with the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Committee, independent of the Norwegian government, awards the prize, yet Trump blames Norway and links it to territorial ambitions.

Minaj accused Lemon of disrespecting Christianity by covering an anti-ICE protest that interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota. The demonstration at Cities Church targeted Pastor David Easterwood, who also serves as an acting field office director for ICE in the region. Protesters disrupted the service to demand accountability for the recent fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier in January, amid heightened immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration.

Initially, Shenzhou 20 had carried astronauts Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie to the Chinese Space Station (CSS). When damage was detected during pre-return inspections, Chinese mission control decided to bring the crew back earlier aboard Shenzhou 21 on November 14, 2025, following a record 204-day stay in orbit — the longest so far for Chinese astronauts.

Such actions by states would constitute acts of war, unlike piracy by non-state actors. The piece highlights historical parallels, like British seizures contributing to the War of 1812, and stresses that Russia has threatened retaliation, potentially by escorting ships with warships or seizing Western vessels. Given the Russian navy's limitations and the even weaker state of the Royal Navy, any independent European action is unlikely without full U.S. backing, which the Trump administration should withhold to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation.

The advisory follows a recent U.S. campaign targeting Venezuelan ships under the guise of combating maritime drug trafficking and a military operation on January 3 aimed at the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife. The Mexican government clarified that the FAA warning is precautionary and does not affect domestic civil aviation operations, with authorities emphasizing that no operational changes or airspace restrictions will be imposed on Mexican carriers.

They publicly released names, profiles, and details of engineers and developers involved in creating the Iron Dome missile defense system—such as Ronen Miller, Shlomo Cohen, and Chen Sarig—labeling them as war criminals for enabling military actions in Gaza. Similar exposures targeted drone program designers like Dan Dayan Rahamim, Oriel Klein, and Michael Ptitsyn, accusing them of direct complicity in surveillance, targeted killings, and what the article terms 'algorithmic genocide.' Handala also claimed breaches involving former officials like Naftali Bennett's phone data, nuclear scientists, Unit 8200 personnel, and companies such as Rada Electronics and Zerto, stealing large amounts of data to undermine Israel's 'digital fortress' image.

Los poemas recogidos abarcan distintas etapas y registros de su obra, desde la denuncia directa de la violencia estructural y la explotación hasta la reflexión ética, el amor, la memoria y la duda.

En composiciones como “Muchas maneras de matar”, Brecht enumera las formas invisibles y normalizadas de la violencia ejercida por el Estado y el sistema económico, subrayando cómo muchas de ellas no están prohibidas pese a causar muerte y sufrimiento. Otros textos, como “Preguntas de un obrero ante un libro”, cuestionan la historia oficial y ponen el foco en los trabajadores anónimos que sostienen las grandes gestas atribuidas a reyes y héroes.

Esta tecnología supera las limitaciones de los filtros convencionales, que no retienen eficientemente partículas a escala nanométrica. El sistema combina un filtro metálico recubierto de óxido de magnesio y un polímero catiónico con un generador triboeléctrico que convierte energía mecánica en electricidad, eliminando la necesidad de energía externa. Además, el filtro es regenerable: al invertir el campo eléctrico, las partículas se desprenden y el filtro puede reutilizarse más de 20 veces sin pérdida de eficacia. Las pruebas con agua del grifo y de río confirmaron su efectividad en condiciones reales, cumpliendo los estándares de calidad de la OMS.

Desde el golpe de Estado en Brasil en 1964 que derrocó al presidente João Goulart hasta el golpe militar en Chile en 1973 contra Salvador Allende, la intervención estadounidense ha estado presente en diversos países de la región. La Operación Cóndor es un ejemplo de cooperación entre dictaduras latinoamericanas para perseguir a opositores políticos, mientras que episodios como el asesinato de un exministro de Allende en Washington muestran la complejidad de estas relaciones. A finales de los años 70 y principios de los 80, con presidentes como Jimmy Carter y Ronald Reagan, la política estadounidense osciló entre restablecer ciertos controles y apoyar regímenes autoritarios. Además de los aspectos políticos, el documental aborda la influencia económica de Estados Unidos en proyectos estratégicos como el Canal de Panamá y cómo la llegada de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Complutense aclara que no se requiere titulación para redactar contratos y cuestiona la acusación de intrusismo a Begoña Gómez]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Universidad Complutense de Madrid ha remitido un informe al juez Juan Carlos Peinado en el que aclara que, según la normativa vigente, no es necesario contar con una titulación específica para redactar pliegos de prescripciones técnicas en contratos universitarios.

Según el análisis, la primera semana, del 26 de enero al 1 de febrero, estará claramente marcada por el paso continuado de frentes asociados a sistemas de bajas presiones procedentes del Atlántico. Estas borrascas dejarán lluvias en la mayor parte de la Península y Baleares, con especial intensidad y persistencia en el oeste y el sur peninsular, y de forma muy destacada en Galicia.

El patrón atmosférico previsto favorecerá la entrada de vientos húmedos y relativamente templados, lo que tendrá un impacto directo en las temperaturas, que se situarán por encima de los valores normales para esta época del año.

Se trata de la undécima prórroga presupuestaria en la historia democrática de España y la tercera consecutiva con las cuentas de 2023, que ya rigieron en 2024 y 2025.

La investigación, centrada en la Cordillera Ibérica (provincia de Teruel), utiliza registros dendrocronológicos de Pinus sylvestris y Pinus nigra para reconstruir la precipitación acumulada en un periodo clave de crecimiento anual. Gracias a la combinación de nuevas muestras recogidas en 2024 y datos históricos previos, los autores han logrado una cronología robusta y bien replicada que permite ir mucho más allá del periodo cubierto por los registros meteorológicos instrumentales.

Los resultados muestran una fuerte variabilidad de la precipitación a lo largo de los siglos, con alternancia de periodos secos y húmedos.

La universidad ha emitido resoluciones de urgencia para evitar la pérdida de derechos por prescripción, pero carece de los recursos para efectuar los pagos. La UAL es la peor financiada de Andalucía, recibiendo 7.803 euros por estudiante frente a la media andaluza de 8.708 y la media nacional de 9.397 euros, lo que supone un déficit anual de entre 12 y 21 millones de euros.

Entre los partidos que votarán a favor se encuentran VVD, CDA, JA21, BBB, PVV, D66 y GroenLinks-PvdA.

Se destaca la erosión de seis pilares fundamentales del poder estadounidense desde la posguerra: inmigración abierta, apoyo a la educación e investigación, comercio libre, estado de derecho, alianzas internacionales sólidas (como la OTAN) y una política monetaria independiente que respalda al dólar como moneda de reserva.

Según relataron los testigos, la mujer salió a la terraza del local con el animal y, cuando este se acercó a una mesa, lo levantó bruscamente tirando de la correa. A continuación, lo mantuvo suspendido en el aire mientras lo zarandeaba y le gritaba. Ante esta situación, varias personas le recriminaron su comportamiento, lo que provocó una reacción aún más violenta: la mujer comenzó a golpear al cachorro con patadas y puñetazos por distintas partes del cuerpo.

En los años sesenta, el auge del automóvil y el desarrollismo impulsaron esta solución ambiciosa para un nudo viario clave donde confluían importantes avenidas y la estación de tren. Aunque inicialmente cumplió su objetivo de agilizar la circulación, pronto se convirtió en un elemento muy polémico por su impacto negativo: oscurecía la plaza, ocultaba edificios históricos, generaba ruido y contaminación, y convertía el espacio en hostil para los peatones, relegando la Fuente de la Alcachofa a un segundo plano.

La llegada de los efectivos se produjo en un contexto de fuerte tensión social, agravada por la difusión de un nuevo vídeo que muestra el desarrollo completo del encuentro entre Pretti y agentes federales del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.

Las imágenes contradicen de forma significativa la versión inicial ofrecida por responsables de la administración Trump, que calificaron a Pretti como un terrorista doméstico con intención de causar el máximo daño a las fuerzas del orden.

El ave, cedida por el Gobierno de Aragón y equipada con un emisor satelital, fue localizada sin vida el domingo 18 de enero de 2026 en el límite entre los municipios cántabros de Peñarrubia y Cillorigo de Liébana, tras detectar los técnicos de la FCQ localizaciones anómalas.

A través de una experiencia directa, Jedeed logró ser reclutada en apenas seis minutos durante un acto de captación en Texas, lo que ilustra la drástica rebaja de los controles de acceso y de los estándares profesionales.

ICE ha pasado de contar con unos 10.000 agentes a sumar aproximadamente 12.000 más en un corto periodo de tiempo. Para lograrlo, la agencia ha eliminado límites de edad, reducido la formación a solo 48 días —casi la mitad de lo habitual— y suprimido cursos clave, como el aprendizaje de castellano. Además, se han introducido incentivos económicos de hasta 50.000 dólares para atraer candidatos.

El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, desmintió públicamente esta información y aclaró que los carriles fueron fabricados por ArcelorMittal, una compañía siderúrgica con presencia internacional pero con producción en España, concretamente en su planta de Gijón.

Puente explicó que los raíles cuentan con trazabilidad completa, incluyendo la identificación de la colada de acero empleada —de unas 200 toneladas— y de los profesionales responsables de las soldaduras. Estas uniones, según detalló, fueron sometidas a controles exhaustivos mediante ultrasonidos y fluidos, superando todas las inspecciones reglamentarias previas al accidente.

En 2007, la empresa Wakayama Electric Railway tomó una decisión inusual: nombrar a una gata tricolor llamada Tama como jefa de estación honoraria en la estación de Kishi. Esta iniciativa, que comenzó como una medida simbólica, se convirtió en un fenómeno turístico inesperado. Tama, vestida con un uniforme diminuto y con su propio despacho, atrajo a miles de visitantes, generó cobertura mediática internacional, trenes decorados con su imagen y una gran cantidad de merchandising. El impacto económico se estima en cientos de millones de yenes, logrando revertir la crisis y salvar la línea.

Sin embargo, Abad insistió en obtener respuestas concretas sobre la inversión en infraestructuras y la gestión de las incidencias en la red ferroviaria.

El debate se centra en los derechos constitucionales del detenido y en los límites de la actuación policial durante el arresto. La defensa de Mangione sostiene que el registro de la mochila vulneró la Cuarta Enmienda de la Constitución de Estados Unidos, que protege frente a registros e incautaciones indebidas, al no existir una orden ni concurrir circunstancias excepcionales que lo justificaran.

El verdadero potencial disruptivo radica en los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, ya que los inversores europeos poseen alrededor de ocho billones de dólares en bonos y otros valores de EE.UU., financiando así gran parte de la enorme deuda americana. Una reestructuración coordinada de estas inversiones, retirando capital de la zona del dólar, podría generar graves problemas a un país altamente endeudado como Estados Unidos.

Su obra y pensamiento cuestionaron los límites de la tecnología, la libertad humana y lo que realmente nos hace humanos. A través de su escritura, anticipó avances científicos como la fecundación artificial y criticó la búsqueda de una felicidad impuesta por la sociedad, mostrando cómo esta puede derivar en desdicha y deshumanización. Además de su faceta literaria, Huxley estudió psicología, se interesó por experiencias visionarias con drogas y exploró la espiritualidad en obras como 'La filosofía perenne', donde identifica verdades compartidas por distintas tradiciones místicas. Su enseñanza más sencilla y revolucionaria, expresada al final de su vida, es que la amabilidad es clave para una existencia plena.

La intervención, que se llevó a cabo en apenas nueve horas durante la noche, permitió integrar tres líneas ferroviarias existentes —Ganlong, Ganruilong y Zhanglong— con una nueva vía de alta velocidad, minimizando el impacto sobre el tráfico ferroviario habitual.

El operativo movilizó a unos 1.500 trabajadores organizados bajo una planificación extremadamente precisa. Los ingenieros responsables dividieron al personal en siete unidades operativas que trabajaron de forma simultánea en tareas muy distintas: desde el movimiento de tierras y la pavimentación con asfalto y hormigón, hasta la instalación de sistemas de señalización, control y monitorización digital del tráfico ferroviario. Para ello se emplearon siete trenes de trabajo especializados y 23 excavadoras, coordinadas al ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-culmina-en-una-noche-la-remodelacion-y-conexion-de-una-estacion-ferroviaria-clave-en-longyan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-culmina-en-una-noche-la-remodelacion-y-conexion-de-una-estacion-ferroviaria-clave-en-longyan</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España encabeza los descarrilamientos en Europa por insuficiente mantenimiento ferroviario]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante 2024, España registró 12 descarrilamientos, muy por encima de la media europea de 2,3 por país, lo que supone el 21% de los incidentes de este tipo en Europa en los últimos dos años, según Eurostat. Esta cifra convierte a España en el país con más descarrilamientos en el continente, superando a Francia y Alemania. Expertos en ingeniería ferroviaria señalan que la causa principal no es la mala suerte, sino fallos estructurales acumulativos en el mantenimiento de la infraestructura, especialmente en vías de alta afluencia de pasajeros como las líneas Madrid-Andalucía. La fatiga de los carriles, causada por el uso constante y la falta de mantenimiento adecuado, genera microgrietas que pueden derivar en accidentes graves, como el trágico descarrilamiento del tren Iryo en Adamuz que causó 45 muertos. Además, se destaca que España dedica solo un 16% del gasto anual al mantenimiento ferroviario, mientras que la media europea se sitúa en torno al 50%.

Siguiendo el consejo habitual, decidió no informar de su embarazo hasta el cuarto mes, momento en el que empezó a sentir molestias al levantar peso. Tras comunicarlo a su encargada, fue cambiada exclusivamente a la caja, una adaptación parcial a su situación. Poco después, notificó también a la central de la empresa. Horas más tarde, recibió una llamada informándole de que no había superado el periodo de prueba por 'valoraciones negativas' y 'rendimiento insuficiente', pese a no haber recibido ninguna queja previa.

Ante la gravedad, el conseller de Sanidad, Marciano Gómez, prometió medidas contundentes si se confirman irregularidades, aunque no aclaró si incluirían la rescisión del contrato. PSPV, Compromís y la Plataforma por la Reversión del Vinalopó exigen terminar la concesión y han anunciado acciones judiciales ante la Fiscalía, junto con protestas frente al hospital.

El contrato, prorrogado en mayo de 2025 hasta mayo de 2030, compromete a la Generalitat a pagar 826,7 millones de euros en total. Restando lo previsto para 2025, quedan pendientes 744,1 millones por los cuatro años restantes.

Uclés, conocido por obras como 'La Península de las casas vacías', que aborda la Guerra Civil española desde el realismo mágico, argumentó en un vídeo en redes sociales que no desea aparecer en el mismo cartel que el expresidente del Gobierno José María Aznar y el exdirigente de Vox Iván Espinosa de los Monteros.

En sus declaraciones, el autor aclaró que no se trata solo del título del evento —que considera inexacto al afirmar que 'todos perdimos' la guerra, cuando los republicanos fueron los derrotados y los franquistas se beneficiaron durante décadas—, sino principalmente por la presencia de estos dos políticos.

Una vecina lo halló muy delgado y débil en su jardín, y al llevarlo al veterinario, el microchip que llevaba desde 2018 permitió identificarlo inmediatamente. Los expertos destacan que los gatos poseen un extraordinario sentido de orientación, utilizando su olfato y memoria espacial, a veces siguiendo ríos o líneas eléctricas, lo que habría permitido a Filou recorrer carreteras peligrosas y zonas urbanas durante meses, a pesar de la deshidratación y las heridas.

Las grabaciones revelan que Pretti actuó en defensa de dos personas durante un operativo contra migrantes, contradiciendo las afirmaciones de que atacó a los funcionarios con un arma. En las imágenes, se observa a Pretti grabando la escena con su teléfono móvil mientras se enfrenta pacíficamente a los agentes. En un primer vídeo, retrocede tras ser empujado por un oficial. En otro, dirige el tráfico para permitir el paso de un vehículo, mientras otros ciudadanos protestan tocando silbatos, una práctica común en la zona para alertar sobre redadas migratorias ordenadas por la administración Trump.

La historia, difundida por el programa “Andalucía Directo” de Canal Sur, pone el foco en un caso concreto que refleja problemas estructurales relacionados con la vivienda y la actuación de los fondos de inversión.

La casa en cuestión no es solo el lugar donde Fran ha vivido siempre, sino también el espacio donde nació y un inmueble adaptado específicamente a sus necesidades de movilidad reducida. El origen del conflicto se remonta a años atrás, cuando su padre utilizó la vivienda como aval para una finca, lo que acabó derivando en la pérdida de la propiedad y su posterior adquisición por un fondo de inversión. Desde entonces, Fran se enfrentaba a la posibilidad real de tener que abandonar su hogar.

Lejos de apartarla de la primera línea política, ese relato sirvió para reforzar su perfil de dirigente dura y sin escrúpulos a la hora de ejecutar decisiones impopulares.

El autor, Ángel L.

La trama arranca con un escritor especializado en lo paranormal que ayuda a un amigo a investigar una casa aparentemente ideal pero con un plano extraño que esconde algo perturbador. Junto a un delineante, descubren que no se trata de errores de diseño, sino de estructuras deliberadas para ocultar secretos oscuros, posiblemente violentos.

El país dispone de unas 3.352 toneladas de oro, las segundas mayores reservas del mundo tras las de Estados Unidos, con un valor aproximado de 450.000 millones de euros. De ese total, alrededor de 1.236 toneladas —casi la mitad del valor— se encuentran en suelo estadounidense.

La controversia surge en un contexto de creciente desconfianza hacia la política exterior y económica de Donald Trump. Sus recientes decisiones militares y presiones diplomáticas han llevado a expertos, economistas y responsables políticos alemanes a plantear si el oro podría convertirse en un instrumento de presión geopolítica.

Según la investigación en curso, la causa más probable fue la rotura del carril derecho precisamente en el punto donde se une material renovado recientemente con carriles antiguos fabricados en 1989, en la época de inauguración de la línea en 1992. La renovación del tramo Guadalmez-Córdoba, adjudicada en 2022 por 60 millones de euros y terminada en gran parte en mayo de 2025, se realizó de forma parcial: solo se renovó el desvío de agujas, dejando intacto el tramo recto donde ocurrió el siniestro.

Niccolò Fontana, conocido como Tartaglia, desarrolló un método secreto para resolver ecuaciones cúbicas y lo mantuvo oculto tras vencer en duelos matemáticos públicos. Gerolamo Cardano, ambicioso autor de Ars Magna, convenció a Tartaglia para que le revelara la fórmula bajo juramento solemne de secreto, prometiendo no publicarla. Sin embargo, Cardano la incluyó en su obra de 1545, rompiendo el juramento y atribuyéndola principalmente a sí mismo, aunque mencionó a Tartaglia y a Scipione del Ferro.

Al aplicar la fórmula, surgió el 'casus irreducibilis': ecuaciones con tres raíces reales evidentes producían expresiones con raíces cuadradas de números negativos, consideradas absurdas por Cardano. Rafael Bombelli, en 1572, aceptó estas cantidades 'imposibles' como legítimas y manipuló algebraicamente expresiones como la raíz cúbica de (2 + √(-121))]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump anuncia que no asistirá al Super Bowl y critica la elección de Bad Bunny y Green Day como artistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha declarado en una entrevista con The New York Times que no asistirá al Super Bowl del próximo 8 de febrero de 2026, que se celebrará en el Levi's Stadium de Santa Clara, California. Aunque expresó que le gustaría ir y que en ediciones anteriores ha sido bien recibido, justificó su ausencia principalmente por la distancia del evento. Sin embargo, aprovechó para criticar duramente la selección de los artistas: el puertorriqueño Bad Bunny, encargado del espectáculo del medio tiempo, y el grupo Green Day, que participará en la ceremonia de apertura. Trump afirmó estar 'en contra' de ambos, calificando su elección como 'pésima' y acusándolos de 'sembrar odio'. Bad Bunny ha sido un crítico abierto de las políticas antimigratorias de Trump, mientras que Billie Joe Armstrong, vocalista de Green Day, ha apoyado recientemente las protestas en Minneapolis contra las redadas del ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas).

En 2024, el Gobierno groenlandés vetó el uso de Starlink, la constelación de satélites de órbita baja de Elon Musk, debido a sus vínculos con el Gobierno estadounidense y el Pentágono, considerándola un riesgo para la soberanía y la seguridad nacional en un contexto de posibles guerras híbridas. En su lugar, el operador nacional Tusass ha reforzado acuerdos con infraestructuras europeas. Desde 2023, varios asentamientos remotos del norte y este de Groenlandia acceden a internet mediante el satélite geoestacionario Amazonas Nexus, operado por la española Hispasat.

El autor argumenta que Abascal no merece ser calificado de 'extrema derecha' en el sentido ideológico clásico, sino que lo tacha de 'extremo comepollas' por su supuesto servilismo y apoyo entusiasta a las políticas del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y a lo que describe como 'masacre sionista'. En concreto, señala que Abascal aplaude las redadas migratorias ('la migra') en EE.UU. y las toma como inspiración para aplicarlas en España. El texto contextualiza este posicionamiento en el supuesto miedo anglosajón a la creciente hispanización del sur de Estados Unidos, donde la población hispana demográficamente empuja con fuerza y el uso del español se extiende.

El anuncio fue realizado por la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, quien subrayó el valor científico del hallazgo al tratarse de un contexto funerario prácticamente intacto, capaz de aportar información directa sobre la organización social, los rituales y la cosmovisión zapoteca durante el periodo Clásico.

La tumba presenta una arquitectura compleja, con antecámara y cámara funeraria, en la que cada elemento escultórico y pictórico posee un significado simbólico preciso.

El trabajo contextualiza el uso de las sanciones como una herramienta recurrente de presión política y económica sobre países del denominado Sur Global, especialmente aquellos que han intentado desarrollar políticas soberanas al margen de los intereses occidentales.

El neurocientífico Michel Desmurget, en su conferencia 'La lectura en 2050' del Instituto Diderot, afirma que mientras los cómics tienen un efecto cognitivo casi nulo, los medios digitales como redes sociales o mensajes cortos tienen incluso un impacto negativo en el cerebro. Leer libros desarrolla el coeficiente intelectual, la concentración, la síntesis y la creatividad, e incluso mejora el rendimiento matemático, algo que la exposición constante a pantallas fragmenta gravemente.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las 9:30 de la mañana en la intersección de East 34th Street y Portland Avenue. Según testigos, varios agentes intentaron acceder al vehículo de Good (un Honda Pilot rojo) y uno de ellos abrió fuego a través de la ventanilla del conductor tras un forcejeo con la puerta.

Los hechos, según quedó acreditado en la vista judicial, describen un patrón prolongado de violencia sexual ejercida en el ámbito doméstico, en el que la víctima fue drogada de manera reiterada para facilitar las agresiones.

Según fuentes citadas por el medio Politico, una de las opciones que se barajan en Washington es la imposición de un bloqueo naval destinado a impedir la llegada de cargamentos de petróleo, como parte de una estrategia más amplia orientada a forzar un cambio político en el país caribeño.

La posible medida contaría con el respaldo de sectores críticos con el Gobierno cubano dentro de la propia Administración y del secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, aunque no existe todavía una decisión definitiva. El debate interno gira en torno a si es necesario llegar a ese extremo, dado que el corte del petróleo venezolano —tras el endurecimiento de sanciones y restricciones a buques— ya ha tenido un impacto significativo en la economía cubana, que lleva años en una situación de semiparálisis.

Según un audio filtrado y divulgado por el periodista Orlando Avendaño, Rodríguez relató que ella, junto a Diosdado Cabello y Jorge Rodríguez, recibieron un ultimátum de solo 15 minutos para responder a demandas estadounidenses y 'recuperar el control de la narrativa' tras la eliminación de Maduro como figura central del régimen, bajo amenaza de ser neutralizados o asesinados. El audio, que data de los días posteriores al operativo, revela que el régimen chavista no anticipaba la escala del ataque militar estadounidense en Caracas, descrito por Rodríguez como una intervención 'impecable y devastadora' que incluyó bombardeos en la capital venezolana. Afirmó que Venezuela contemplaba posibles acciones desde Washington, pero no de tal magnitud, llegando a calificar el asalto c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-denuncia-en-audio-filtrado-amenazas-de-estados-unidos-tras-la-captura-de-nicolas-maduro-en-caracas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-denuncia-en-audio-filtrado-amenazas-de-estados-unidos-tras-la-captura-de-nicolas-maduro-en-caracas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno aprueba el anteproyecto de Ley de Crédito al Consumo que prohíbe conceder créditos no solicitados y limita costes en revolving y microcréditos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de España ha aprobado el anteproyecto de Ley sobre Crédito al Consumo, que transpone directivas europeas y refuerza la protección de los consumidores frente al sobreendeudamiento. La norma prohíbe expresamente a los bancos y entidades conceder créditos, emitir tarjetas de crédito o ampliar límites de financiación sin solicitud previa y consentimiento expreso del cliente. Esta medida aborda prácticas habituales en el sector, como el envío de tarjetas no pedidas o el incremento unilateral de líneas de crédito, que ya estaban parcialmente limitadas por la Ley de Servicios de Pagos, pero ahora se endurecen.

La regulación abarca un amplio espectro de productos: préstamos personales, microcréditos, créditos rápidos, pagos fraccionados tipo 'buy now, pay later' y tarjetas revolving. Se establecen límites al coste del crédito para evitar la usura, con especial énfasis en los productos más caros, como las revolving y los descubiertos en cuenta.

Los Chromebooks, portátiles económicos basados en ChromeOS, han sido distribuidos en centros educativos no solo por su bajo coste y facilidad de uso, sino también como parte de una estrategia para que los niños se acostumbren a su ecosistema tecnológico. El informe de Google indica que si un usuario empieza a usar un sistema operativo o plataformas como YouTube desde temprana edad, es más probable que continúe utilizándolos en la vida adulta, generando así fidelidad a la marca. Aunque ChromeOS representa actualmente solo el 1,24% del mercado de ordenadores, la compañía considera que su presencia en escuelas puede influir en futuras decisiones de compra.

Sin embargo, al llegar la noche, quedaron atrapadas al no haber asegurado ningún medio de transporte para el regreso. La línea de autobús 692 (la principal conexión pública) ya había finalizado su servicio, recortado además por la borrasca, y ninguno de los excursionistas disponía de vehículo propio ni de cadenas u otros medios para descender por sus propios medios.

Las condiciones meteorológicas eran extremas: temperaturas bajo cero, visibilidad muy reducida y fuerte temporal de nieve. Ante el riesgo inminente de hipotermia por exposición prolongada al frío, se activó un dispositivo de rescate coordinado por Emergencias 112 de la Comunidad de Madrid.

En 2025, al menos 30 personas fallecieron bajo custodia, la cifra más alta desde 2004 y superior al total registrado durante los cuatro años de la administración de Joe Biden, que sumó 26 muertes. A finales de 2025, más de 68 mil adultos estaban detenidos por el ICE, frente a 36 mil en 2023. En los primeros días de 2026, ya se registraron seis muertes adicionales, incluyendo casos de suicidio y problemas de salud relacionados con el corazón. Observadores externos, como la ACLU, han denunciado que hasta el 95% de estas muertes podrían haberse prevenido con atención médica adecuada, revelando retrasos y tratamientos inapropiados en los centros de detención.

Sus padres, Ernesto Alonso y Marbella Carranza, intentaron buscar apoyo médico y económico para su hospitalización mediante una campaña en GoFundMe, pero el estado de salud de la niña se deterioró rápidamente y no sobrevivió. La familia denunció que las autoridades escolares no actuaron ante las reiteradas denuncias de acoso, dejando a Jocelynn sin protección.

A raíz de recientes descarrilamientos en Córdoba, el recuerdo de aquella tragedia vuelve a primer plano tras conocerse una sentencia que exculpa al exjefe de seguridad de Adif y atribuye toda la responsabilidad al maquinista.

La información detalla cómo, pese a la rápida llegada de vecinos y servicios de emergencia, el rescate estuvo marcado por fallos de coordinación: retrasos de más de dos horas en declarar el nivel de alerta adecuado, ausencia de un puesto de mando avanzado durante casi dos horas, falta de medios técnicos y dependencia de teléfonos móviles para dirigir el operativo.

En ese contexto, los agentes encontraron al guardia civil conversando con una mujer y este se identificó mostrando su placa.

Para justificar su presencia, el agente afirmó estar interrogando a una confidente dentro de una operación confidencial contra el narcotráfico. Llegó incluso a asegurar que pertenecía a la unidad OCON-Sur, especializada en la lucha contra el narcotráfico en el Campo de Gibraltar.

Desde 2024, la partida para cooperación ha pasado de unos 450.000 euros anuales a quedarse en 220.000 euros, una reducción cercana al 50% que ya está afectando de forma directa a proyectos humanitarios y al funcionamiento de entidades con décadas de trayectoria. Según la Coordinadora Granadina de ONGs (CONGRA), estas ayudas no son complementarias, sino estructurales, y su desaparición pone en riesgo iniciativas esenciales.

El recorte se produce en un contexto económico que, según las asociaciones, no lo justifica. El presupuesto de la Diputación para 2026 asciende a 418,5 millones de euros, con superávit previsto y deuda cero.

Según el artículo, la presión asistencial ha aumentado un 30% respecto a picos históricos previos, afectando a hospitales de prácticamente todas las comunidades autónomas. Las urgencias se han convertido en la puerta de entrada al sistema sanitario debido al progresivo desmantelamiento de la Atención Primaria, incapaz de absorber la demanda por falta de financiación, personal y recursos.

Esta saturación impacta especialmente en la población sin seguros privados, que representa alrededor del 60%, y que ve deteriorada la calidad y seguridad de la atención recibida. Pacientes son atendidos en pasillos, sillas o camillas improvisadas, mientras el personal sanitario soporta sobrecargas laborales que generan un grave desgaste físico y emocional.

Trump sugirió en una entrevista que los aliados enviaron tropas pero «se quedaron un poco atrás, un poco fuera de las líneas del frente», lo que ha generado indignación en Reino Unido. Starmer rindió homenaje a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en la misión y subrayó que nunca olvidará su valentía y sacrificio. El príncipe Harry también intervino, afirmando que los sacrificios de los soldados británicos merecen «ser hablados con verdad y respeto».

La víctima, que se encontraba en proceso de separación de su expareja, salió a la calle pidiendo auxilio antes de desplomarse. Un vecino o familiar accedió al domicilio y la encontró en el suelo en un charco de sangre junto a un cuchillo de cocina, que fue intervenido como arma del crimen.

Los servicios sanitarios del 112-Andalucía confirmaron el fallecimiento en el lugar.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las cinco de la tarde en el lugar de O Castro, en la parroquia de Seixo, cuando el afectado se encontraba realizando trabajos de soldadura en un galpón anexo a su vivienda.

Según informaron fuentes sanitarias, el hombre procedió a cortar una bombona que creía vacía por motivos que no han trascendido. Sin embargo, el cilindro aún contenía gas en su interior y, al entrar en contacto con la herramienta eléctrica, se produjo una fuerte explosión que destrozó por completo el galpón. Como consecuencia del estallido, el hombre sufrió heridas de gravedad, entre ellas una profunda brecha en la frente, por lo que fue evacuado de urgencia en una UVI móvil al Hospital de Montecelo, en Pontevedra.

Lejos de investigarse los hechos, la Administración Trump ha calificado a la víctima de “terrorista” sin aportar pruebas y ha mantenido la impunidad del agente implicado, lo que ha actuado como detonante de una respuesta social masiva.

El Congreso andorrano dio luz verde a un proyecto de ley que introduce cambios en la normativa migratoria, fiscal y de vivienda, con especial impacto sobre grandes fortunas, inversores extranjeros y trabajadores por cuenta propia como youtubers e influencers.

El objetivo principal de la reforma es contener la especulación inmobiliaria en un territorio con una superficie muy limitada y un mercado de vivienda tensionado. Según expertos legales, el auge descontrolado de la inversión en inmuebles había elevado de forma significativa los precios, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda para la población residente. Para corregir esta situación, la nueva normativa incrementa el impuesto por la compra de vivienda del 3% al 6% sobre el valor de adquisición.

Junto a su esposa Marcolina Argüelles, también luchadora por la libertad, formó una familia pese a las dificultades y recibió homenaje por su trayectoria en 2022 en La Felguera.

El programa utiliza fondos públicos del American Rescue Plan Act para comprar deudas médicas a hospitales y agencias de cobro por una fracción de su valor y, posteriormente, anularlas por completo. No existe un proceso de solicitud: las personas beneficiarias reciben una carta en su domicilio informándoles de que parte o la totalidad de su deuda ha sido eliminada.

Madrid, sostiene, se ha vuelto previsible, convertida en un producto que responde a una estrategia de marketing urbano basada en atraer talento, turistas e inversiones, más que en cuidar la vida cotidiana de quienes la habitan.

Bravo critica la transformación de la ciudad en una marca que prioriza restaurantes de moda, grandes eventos y campañas publicitarias, fomentando la segmentación social y el individualismo.

La historia sigue a una mujer embarazada que se refugia en una choza abandonada en una montaña nevada, huyendo de una situación de opresión y violencia. Dirigiéndose en segunda persona a su hija nonata, la protagonista mantiene un diálogo íntimo y esperanzador mientras enfrenta el aislamiento, el frío y la precariedad. El narrador, dubitativo e impersonal, adopta un tono cíclico y letánico, centrado en los elementos naturales (montaña, nieve, animales) y en la sonoridad del lenguaje.

A diferencia de relatos de supervivencia épicos o históricos, esta obra prescinde casi por completo de anclajes temporales y geográficos concretos —salvo sutiles evocaciones rifeñas—, lo que le confiere una dimensión universal.

Al incluir el impacto sobre ecosistemas marinos, pesca, infraestructuras costeras, arrecifes de coral y manglares —el llamado “capital azul”—, el coste por tonelada de CO₂ emitida pasa de unos 51 dólares a cerca de 97 dólares, lo que supone un incremento de aproximadamente el 91%.

Este dato es crucial porque el coste social del carbono es la base sobre la que se diseñan políticas públicas como los impuestos al carbono o los sistemas de comercio de emisiones.

Estos pertenecen a la llamada 'quinta gama': alimentos cocinados de forma industrial, envasados al vacío o en atmósfera controlada, y listos para calentar y servir mediante horno o microondas. Según la Federación Española de Hostelería y Restauración (FEHR), la mayoría de los locales incorporan en mayor o menor medida este tipo de productos, motivados por el ahorro en personal, tiempo y equipamiento, ya que no requieren fogones ni cocineros especializados.

A diferencia de los precocinados ultraprocesados de supermercado, cargados de aditivos, grasas y azúcares, la quinta gama busca mantener sabor, textura y apariencia similares a lo casero, minimizando conservantes artificiales. Sin embargo, la Confederación de Consumidores y Usuarios (CECU) denuncia la falta de transparencia: los clientes pagan precios de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cocina-de-quinta-gama-se-extiende-en-los-restaurantes-espanoles-por-ahorro-de-costes-pero-falta-transparencia-hacia-el-cliente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cocina-de-quinta-gama-se-extiende-en-los-restaurantes-espanoles-por-ahorro-de-costes-pero-falta-transparencia-hacia-el-cliente</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El declive de la vida comunitaria y el papel del capitalismo frente al discurso xenófobo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo reflexiona sobre la nostalgia, compartida por distintas generaciones, hacia una comunidad vecinal hoy prácticamente desaparecida: barrios y pueblos donde existían relaciones cotidianas de apoyo mutuo, conocimiento personal entre vecinos y una sociabilidad intensa que generaba vínculos afectivos estables. El autor sostiene que esta añoranza es comprensible, ya que los seres humanos necesitamos lazos sociales, incluso de baja intensidad, para nuestro bienestar.

Sin embargo, el texto desmonta el argumento habitual de la extrema derecha que atribuye la desaparición de esa comunidad a la inmigración. El razonamiento es simple pero erróneo: si la comunidad se diluye al mismo tiempo que llegan nuevos vecinos de otros países, se concluye que estos son los responsables. Para refutarlo, el autor pone como ejemplo las urbanizaciones de clase media en las periferias urbanas, formadas casi exclusivamente por población nativa y homogénea, donde no existe una vida comunitaria fuerte y, d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-de-la-vida-comunitaria-y-el-papel-del-capitalismo-frente-al-discurso-xenofobo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-de-la-vida-comunitaria-y-el-papel-del-capitalismo-frente-al-discurso-xenofobo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Audiencia Nacional procesa a Claudio Rivas por un fraude de IVA en hidrocarburos de más de 70 millones]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Audiencia Nacional ha acordado procesar al empresario Claudio Rivas, presunto socio de Víctor de Aldama, por su supuesta implicación en un fraude millonario en el sector de los hidrocarburos cometido entre los años 2016 y 2018. El magistrado Antonio Piña considera que existen indicios suficientes para sentar en el banquillo a Rivas y a otras 21 personas por delitos contra la Hacienda Pública, falsedad documental, blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, relacionados con un fraude de más de 70 millones de euros en el pago del IVA.

Esta causa es independiente del conocido como ‘caso Hidrocarburos’, en el que Rivas y Aldama llegaron a ingresar en prisión preventiva por una presunta defraudación de 182,5 millones de euros en IVA entre 2022 y 2024 a través de la empresa Villafuel, investigada por el juez Santiago Pedraz.

Según los datos oficiales de Adif, la inversión ha experimentado un fuerte incremento en los últimos años: de aproximadamente 1.700 millones de euros en 2017 se ha pasado a cerca de 5.000 millones en 2025, con 4.700 millones ya ejecutados hasta noviembre de ese año. Este crecimiento supone una triplicación de la cifra respecto al periodo anterior.

El análisis compara diferentes etapas políticas. Durante el mandato de Mariano Rajoy (2012-2018), las inversiones se redujeron significativamente (hasta un 16% en algunos periodos y un 60% en comparación con los años previos a la crisis), alcanzando mínimos en 2016 con 1.657 millones.

Un vehículo que participaba en dicha concentración se salió de la vía por el margen derecho en un cruce, arrollando a varios peatones que se encontraban en un paso de cebra y en la acera contigua. El suceso dejó un balance de nueve personas heridas: tres de ellas en estado grave y seis con lesiones leves, según el comunicado oficial de la Guardia Civil (aunque algunas fuentes mencionan variaciones en la gravedad). Todos los peatones afectados fueron trasladados al Hospital de Cabueñes para recibir atención médica.

Esta omisión estuvo vinculada al racismo y la esclavitud, permitiendo que los estados sureños excluyeran sistemáticamente a la población negra del sistema electoral. La XV enmienda, tras la Guerra Civil, introdujo el derecho a voto para ciudadanos sin distinción de raza, color o condición de exesclavo, pero dejó otras posibles restricciones intactas. Los tribunales y legisladores sureños aprovecharon estas lagunas mediante exámenes de alfabetización, impuestos y cláusulas de abuelo, que limitaron de facto el voto de los afroamericanos durante décadas, dando lugar a las leyes de segregación Jim Crow.

El estudio subraya que en 2025 el número de milmillonarios superó los 3.000, mientras que figuras como Elon Musk acumulan fortunas de cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Este fenómeno contrasta con una realidad global marcada por la pobreza: la mitad de la población mundial vive con menos de 8,3 dólares al día y más de una cuarta parte sufre inseguridad alimentaria.

Inicialmente, la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, compartió una foto donde Armstrong aparecía con rostro sereno. Media hora después, la Casa Blanca publicó la misma imagen pero digitalmente alterada para mostrarla llorando, con la boca abierta y la frente arrugada. La publicación añadía un texto que la calificaba como 'agitadora de extrema izquierda' y no especificaba que la imagen había sido modificada. No quedó claro si se utilizó inteligencia artificial o software de edición tradicional para la alteración.

Se menciona como ejemplo la obra de William Gayley Simpson, un ex pastor que se convirtió en un influyente ideólogo neonazi en Estados Unidos, autor de un libro racista que buscaba radicalizar a la población blanca contra judíos e inmigrantes.

La gobernadora, Kathy Hochul, anunció la medida como parte de una estrategia preventiva para facilitar la movilización de recursos y garantizar la seguridad de la población frente a un fenómeno meteorológico que podría tener un impacto significativo. Según los servicios meteorológicos, se esperan intensas nevadas, temperaturas extremadamente bajas, acumulaciones de hielo, fuertes rachas de viento y una ola de frío que podría provocar cortes de electricidad y la caída de árboles.

Se trata de la fase theta del nitruro de tantalio, capaz de transportar el calor a una velocidad cercana a los 1.100 W/m·K, casi tres veces superior a la del cobre, que hasta ahora era el estándar en sistemas de disipación térmica.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista Science, supone un cambio relevante en la comprensión de cómo se transporta el calor en los metales. Durante décadas, se asumía que la interacción entre electrones y fonones imponía un límite difícil de superar. Sin embargo, la estructura atómica del nitruro de tantalio en fase theta —con átomos de tantalio dispuestos en un patrón hexagonal y nitrógeno intercalado— reduce de forma drástica la fricción térmica interna, permitiendo un flujo de calor mucho más eficiente.

Según el medio, los reservistas finlandeses obtuvieron resultados tan superiores frente a las tropas estadounidenses que la dirección del ejercicio llegó a pedirles que redujeran la presión para evitar una sensación de humillación y desmoralización en las fuerzas de EE. UU.

En el ejercicio, diseñado para probar la capacidad operativa de la OTAN en condiciones árticas extremas, los soldados finlandeses actuaron como fuerza atacante, mientras que las unidades estadounidenses, incluidas tropas del Cuerpo de Marines y del Ejército de Tierra, asumieron el papel defensivo. De acuerdo con fuentes militares citadas por The Times, los finlandeses demostraron una notable ventaja táctica y operativa, especialmente en combate y maniobras en clima frío.

Cameron destacó que Nueva Zelanda logró eliminar el virus en dos ocasiones y que, cuando reapareció en una variante mutada, el país ya contaba con una tasa de vacunación cercana al 98%. Frente a esto, contrastó la situación estadounidense, donde la vacunación se quedó en torno al 62% y, según él, siguió una tendencia descendente. Para el director, esta diferencia refleja una brecha más profunda: la capacidad de una sociedad para actuar de forma cohesionada y basar sus decisiones en el conocimiento científico.

La investigación, que analizó el comportamiento de un amplio número de perros, encontró que aproximadamente el 10% de los perros salchicha exhiben rasgos agresivos, una proporción significativamente mayor que la media de otras razas. Los investigadores atribuyen esta tendencia a una combinación de factores genéticos, históricos y de entrenamiento. Históricamente, los perros salchicha fueron criados para cazar tejones y otros animales subterráneos, lo que requería valentía y determinación, características que podrían haber contribuido a su predisposición a la agresividad. Si bien el estudio ofrece una perspectiva interesante sobre el comportamiento de esta raza, es crucial recordar que la genética no es el único factor determinante.

A partir de un estudio que señala que la mitad de la población española admite odiar a alguien o a algún colectivo, el autor cuestiona la mala reputación general del término y propone distinguir entre un odio destructivo y un odio dirigido contra quienes ejercen la opresión o la violencia.

Tecé argumenta que el odio, entendido como rechazo firme hacia determinadas actitudes o estructuras de poder, ha sido históricamente un motor de cambio social. Ejemplifica esta idea con el rechazo hacia el esclavismo, el nazismo, el machismo o la explotación laboral, señalando que sin una aversión clara hacia estas realidades no habría habido avances en derechos humanos.

Fanone, quien sufrió graves lesiones durante el ataque y posteriormente se jubiló de la policía, ha sido un crítico de la respuesta política a los eventos del 6 de enero y ha entrevistado previamente al líder de Dropkick Murphys, Ken Casey.

A pesar del riesgo inminente, el expresidente Donald Trump aprovechó la situación para minimizar la relevancia del cambio climático, publicando en Truth Social comentarios irónicos que cuestionan la existencia del calentamiento global y lo califican de 'estafa'. La postura de Trump y de muchos miembros del Partido Republicano ha sido históricamente escéptica frente a la ciencia climática, a pesar de que organismos como la NOAA explican que olas de frío extremo no contradicen el calentamiento global. De hecho, el cambio climático puede incluso aumentar la intensidad de algunas tormentas invernales al aportar más humedad y energía térmica a la atmósfera.

Sin embargo, esta estrategia no ha tenido el efecto deseado. Los datos muestran un crecimiento significativo en las ventas de coches chinos en Europa, destacando especialmente a marcas como MG y BYD. MG finalizó el año en el puesto 16 del mercado europeo, superando a marcas consolidadas como CUPRA, Nissan y Fiat. Por su parte, BYD ascendió al puesto 22, superando a Suzuki, MINI y Mazda. En total, los fabricantes chinos vendieron más de 810.000 unidades en 2025, lo que supone un incremento del 99% respecto a 2024, y representando aproximadamente uno de cada diez coches nuevos vendidos en Europa.

La nota recuerda que Trump aprendió de su abogado Roy Cohn una estrategia basada en la mentira sistemática, el ataque a las autoridades y la manipulación de la opinión pública. Tras los rumores de una posible intervención militar en Groenlandia y el anuncio de precios exorbitantes por el territorio, Trump ha creado una especie de versión personal de la ONU, denominada 'Junta de Paz', que preside él mismo y en la que ya ha puesto a la venta sillones de miembros permanentes por mil millones de dólares cada uno.

El tribunal argumentó que las tuberías son infraestructura civil, no militar, y que las acciones encubiertas no están cubiertas por el derecho internacional humanitario, ya que no hay pruebas de que actuara con uniforme o órdenes estatales explícitas. Por ello, el sospechoso será juzgado por violar la seguridad interna de Alemania y atentar contra su soberanía, e incluso podría investigarse como crimen de guerra por atacar instalaciones civiles.

El fuerte oleaje y la erosión marina provocados por el temporal dejaron al descubierto una serie de estructuras sumergidas frente a la actual ciudad de Nabeul que podrían corresponder a la antigua Neápolis, una ciudad de origen púnico que más tarde fue romanizada y cuya localización exacta llevaba siglos siendo objeto de debate.

Según los investigadores, las ruinas visibles incluyen muros, bloques de piedra y trazados urbanos que sugieren la existencia de un asentamiento costero de cierta entidad. Las fuentes clásicas ya mencionaban que Neápolis sufrió un devastador maremoto en el siglo IV d.C., un desastre natural que habría provocado el hundimiento parcial de la ciudad bajo el mar. Los nuevos restos observados encajan con esta descripción histórica y refuerzan la hipótesis de que una parte significativa del núcleo urbano quedó sumergida de forma permanente.

La decisión, tomada por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), ha causado sorpresa e indignación entre los fiscales federales, que tenían previsto llevar al acusado a juicio y solicitar una pena de hasta 15 años de prisión.

Presilla Flores estaba acusado, junto a otras seis personas, de vigilar un camión blindado de la empresa Brinks en 2022 y aprovechar una parada en un área de descanso rural al norte de Los Ángeles para sustraer diamantes, esmeraldas, rubíes, oro y relojes de lujo.

Según la experta Profesora Helen Roy, del UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology y la Universidad de Exeter, este fenómeno se debe a varios factores favorables: un invierno benigno que permitió una buena emergencia de mariquitas tras la hibernación, una abundancia temprana de pulgones (su principal alimento) gracias a una primavera seca, y periodos de calor y humedad en verano que aceleraron su ciclo vital y reproducción.

Muchas de las mariquitas avistadas podrían ser de la especie arlequín, invasora y propensa a agruparse en grandes números, especialmente en paredes soleadas o en interiores buscando refugio. A pesar de las apariencias, las mariquitas son completamente inofensivas para humanos y mascotas: no pican, no son venenosas y no transmiten enfermedades.

El caso, que involucra una importante cantidad de cocaína, ha generado controversia por la fragilidad de las pruebas presentadas por la acusación. Los abogados defensores argumentaron que la investigación carecía de solidez y que no existían pruebas concluyentes que ligaran a sus clientes con el alijo. La sentencia, dictada tras un juicio celebrado entre noviembre y diciembre de 2025, no es firme y puede ser recurrida ante el Tribunal Supremo.

Según el documento, las muestras de la vía fueron retiradas bajo supervisión de la Policía Judicial y trasladadas a Madrid para su análisis, junto con los registradores de datos tanto del tren accidentado como de un tren Alvia que circulaba por la misma línea. Este primer informe refuerza la hipótesis de que la fractura en el raíl pudo existir antes del paso del tren, aunque la investigación sigue abierta y se esperan más conclusiones.

La presidenta madrileña reivindicó la figura de Gregorio Ordóñez en un acto del PP por el 31 aniversario de su asesinato, para criticar al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez por supuestamente 'blanquear' a ETA y plantear si un nuevo político como él tendría que vivir escoltado hoy en día. Ordóñez acusó al PP de practicar un odio más cruel que el recibido en su día de la izquierda abertzale, denominando al partido de 'derecha abertzale'. Afirmó que su hermano sería considerado un 'hereje' por el PP actual, ya que defendía los derechos ciudadanos sin exaltar patrias ni banderas (salvo la de Donostia), trataba a los adversarios con respeto y confiaba en la rebelión ciudadana contra ETA, no en discursos altisonantes.

La colisión ocurrió en un tramo gestionado por un consorcio de empresas privadas que construyen, mantienen y supervisan sus propios trabajos, lo que según los sindicatos de maquinistas ha reducido significativamente el control público sobre la seguridad. A pesar de la histórica inversión estatal de 4.500 millones de euros en 2024, la mayor parte se destinó a nuevas infraestructuras de alta velocidad, mientras que el mantenimiento de la red convencional quedó insuficientemente financiado. En Catalunya, por ejemplo, entre 2015 y 2022 solo se ejecutó un tercio del presupuesto previsto, reflejando un deterioro en los servicios y un aumento de averías.

El tribunal confirma la pena de dos años y seis meses de prisión impuesta al maquinista Francisco Garzón Amo como autor de 79 delitos de homicidio y 143 de lesiones por imprudencia grave. Los magistrados concluyen que el descarrilamiento se debió exclusivamente a la distracción del conductor, quien circulaba a casi 200 km/h en una curva limitada a 80 km/h mientras mantenía una conversación telefónica innecesaria con el interventor, ignorando señales visuales y acústicas. Se descarta la falta de formación o desconocimiento del tramo por parte del maquinista.

Durante la inspección del material rodante se han detectado muescas en las ruedas del lado derecho de varios coches del Iryo, compatibles con el impacto contra un carril previamente roto.

Esta medida, vigente desde 2021 pero demorada por el Ayuntamiento debido a la pandemia de covid-19, busca mejorar la accesibilidad para personas invidentes y con movilidad reducida, garantizando un paso más amplio en las aceras.

Muchos propietarios reconocen que la intención es positiva, pero denuncian el impacto económico y práctico.

Esta acción se enmarca dentro del cumplimiento del real decreto ley de medidas urgentes contra el genocidio en Gaza y de apoyo a la población palestina, aprobado en septiembre de 2025, que prohíbe la publicidad de bienes y servicios procedentes de territorios ocupados. Según el ministerio, los indicios apuntan a que varias empresas israelíes podrían estar ofreciendo viajes a localidades como Jericó, en la Cisjordania palestina ocupada, aprovechando la relevancia de Fitur y la afluencia de miles de visitantes. Esta medida se suma a la iniciativa del pasado diciembre, cuando el ministerio exigió a siete multinacionales la retirada de 138 anuncios de alojamientos en asentamientos israelíes dentro del territorio palestino ocu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-consumo-abre-investigacion-sobre-viajes-a-territorios-palestinos-ocupados-presentados-en-fitur</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-consumo-abre-investigacion-sobre-viajes-a-territorios-palestinos-ocupados-presentados-en-fitur</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo diseñar sistemas de diálogo escalables mediante arquitecturas basadas en grafos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo reflexiona sobre los retos arquitectónicos que plantean los sistemas de diálogo en software, desde chatbots sencillos hasta videojuegos complejos, y defiende la necesidad de diseñarlos pensando en su crecimiento futuro. El autor parte de una idea clave: los requisitos rara vez permanecen estables, y la diferencia entre un sistema sostenible y una pesadilla técnica está en anticipar cómo y por dónde va a evolucionar.

Tradicionalmente, los diálogos se modelan como árboles de decisión, una estructura válida para casos triviales pero que se vuelve rígida y difícil de mantener cuando la complejidad aumenta. Frente a este enfoque, el texto propone entender el diálogo como un grafo dirigido y débilmente conexo, lo que permite reutilizar fragmentos, retroceder, introducir nuevas rutas y crecer de forma orgánica sin reescribir todo el sistema.

Este cambio conceptual abre la puerta a una validación estructural del diálogo: antes de desplegarlo, es posible comprobar automáticamente ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-disenar-sistemas-de-dialogo-escalables-mediante-arquitecturas-basadas-en-grafos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-disenar-sistemas-de-dialogo-escalables-mediante-arquitecturas-basadas-en-grafos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El desafío científico de entender la conciencia humana]]></title><description><![CDATA[La conciencia sigue siendo uno de los grandes enigmas de la ciencia. Aunque los seres vivos empezaron a desarrollar sistemas nerviosos complejos hace cientos de millones de años, aún no se sabe cómo surge la experiencia subjetiva. La neurociencia ha avanzado en identificar correlatos neuronales de la conciencia, como redes cerebrales cuya actividad refleja estados conscientes o inconscientes, y herramientas como la estimulación magnética transcraneal (TMS) combinada con electroencefalografía (EEG) permiten medir la complejidad cerebral asociada a la conciencia. Sin embargo, estas técnicas solo describen cómo el cerebro alcanza la conciencia, no por qué se siente de determinada manera. Existen múltiples teorías para explicar este fenómeno: la teoría del espacio de trabajo neuronal global (GNWT), que ve la conciencia como un escenario donde la información se proyecta y se integra; las teorías de orden superior, que dependen de representaciones meta-cognitivas; las teorías de reentrada y ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Víctimas de residencias critican la propuesta de Ayuso de un funeral en Madrid por el accidente de Adamuz como un intento de protagonismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha anunciado su intención de organizar una misa funeral en la catedral de La Almudena por las víctimas del grave accidente ferroviario ocurrido en Adamuz (Córdoba) el 18 de enero de 2026, donde un tren Iryo descarriló e invadió la vía contraria, colisionando con un Alvia de Renfe y dejando 45 fallecidos y más de un centenar de heridos. Este anuncio llega tras días de silencio político por parte de Ayuso, rompiendo la unidad mostrada inicialmente entre administraciones. El funeral oficial de Estado se celebrará en Huelva el 31 de enero, dado que la mayoría de víctimas eran andaluzas, especialmente de esa provincia. La propuesta de Ayuso ha generado polémica por su carácter religioso (cuando los funerales de Estado suelen ser laicos) y por realizarse en Madrid, lejos del lugar del suceso.

Esta oferta premium promete mayor confort, serenidad y servicios personalizados (acceso a salones, cambios sin coste, espacio dedicado para trabajar o descansar), pero incluye una restricción: el espacio tranquilo está reservado a viajeros a partir de 12 años, por lo que no se pueden reservar plazas allí para niños menores de esa edad. La medida afecta solo a un porcentaje reducido de plazas (alrededor del 8% entre semana), y la SNCF defiende que responde a demandas de clientes que buscan tranquilidad, recordando que ya existía una limitación similar en la oferta anterior sin apenas críticas.

El personaje encarna una concepción nómada de la vida, tanto en lo geográfico como en lo ideológico, y funciona como un alter ego idealizado de su autor. A lo largo de los trece álbumes publicados entre 1967 y 1988, Pratt construyó un universo marcado por el viaje constante, la falta de arraigo y una profunda melancolía que se expresa tanto en los silencios como en su característico blanco y negro de trazo impresionista.

La biografía de Pratt resulta clave para entender la obra. Hijo de un funcionario destinado en la Etiopía colonial, pasó su infancia entre Venecia, África y más tarde Argentina, donde su contacto con Héctor Germán Oesterheld fue decisivo para su madurez artística. De esa etapa surgieron trabajos fundamentales como Ernie Pike o Sargento Kirk, que asentaron una forma de narrar basada en la sugerencia, el ritmo pausado y la primacía ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Filtración masiva de datos personales de 47 políticos autonómicos de 15 comunidades, incluyendo varios presidentes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un atacante conocido como 'Eurogosth' ha publicado en un portal especializado en doxxing datos personales de 47 políticos de alto nivel pertenecientes a 15 comunidades autónomas españolas.

A diferencia de muchos materiales etiquetados como biodegradables o compostables, que solo se degradan en condiciones industriales muy concretas, este plástico se comporta como uno convencional durante su uso cotidiano y se descompone cuando entra en contacto con el agua de mar.

El material está formado por componentes iónicos sencillos que se autoensamblan en una red tridimensional resistente mediante enlaces conocidos como puentes salinos. En presencia de sal marina, estos enlaces se rompen porque los iones compiten entre sí, provocando que el plástico se disuelva en cuestión de horas en moléculas que pueden ser metabolizadas por bacterias.

El proyecto contempla una transformación radical del territorio con torres residenciales y hoteles de lujo en primera línea de playa, un gran puerto en el Mediterráneo, un aeropuerto en la frontera con Egipto y nuevas ciudades que se desarrollarían por fases, empezando por el sur (como Rafah y Khan Yunis) y avanzando hacia el norte hasta la Ciudad de Gaza. Se inspira en modelos como Dubái o zonas vacacionales de Florida, promoviendo una economía basada en el libre mercado y atrayendo inversión privada. Trump defendió la idea destacando la 'ubicación espectacular' junto al mar y prometió una reconstrucción 'cuidadosamente diseñada' con respaldo internacional.

Tras comentarios sobre una posible anexión de Canadá y la imposición de aranceles, los canadienses lanzaron una campaña bajo el lema 'codos arriba', que provocó caídas significativas en las importaciones de bebidas alcohólicas estadounidenses (hasta un 60% en bourbon y whisky), zumo de naranja de Florida y una reducción notable en viajes a EE.UU., con impactos económicos millonarios para el país vecino.

En paralelo, Europa enfrenta una situación similar tras el anuncio de Trump de aranceles del 10-25% a varios países europeos (incluyendo Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega, Francia, Alemania, Países Bajos, Finlandia y Reino Unido) por oponerse a la anexión de Groenlandia a partir de febrero de 2026.

La víctima sufrió una pérdida del 84% de visión en el ojo izquierdo debido a una rotura coroidea y una hemorragia subretiniana, según los informes médicos. La agresión comenzó dentro de la discoteca por un conflicto verbal que involucraba a uno de los amigos de la víctima y continuó en el exterior, donde el joven fue rodeado y golpeado con puñetazos y patadas por varios miembros del grupo agresor. Las cámaras de seguridad permitieron reconstruir los hechos y confirmar que hubo una actuación coordinada entre los agresores.

Estas acciones han sido criticadas por organizaciones como el Movimiento Boicot, Desinversiones y Sanciones a Israel (BDS), que denuncian la utilización del turismo como herramienta de propaganda para mejorar la imagen del Estado israelí mientras persiste la ocupación ilegal según resoluciones de la ONU. A pesar de estas denuncias y de las demandas de colectivos sociales y parlamentarios, Ifema mantiene la participación de Israel, recordando que este país ha estado presente en todas las ediciones de Fitur desde 1981.

El gobierno estadounidense justifica esta decisión citando deficiencias de la OMS en la gestión de crisis sanitarias y la influencia política de otros estados miembros, especialmente China. Washington aportaba hasta el 25% del presupuesto de la agencia y consideraba que otros países, como China, no pagaban cuotas equivalentes, generando un trato que consideran injusto. Además, destacan que la OMS nunca tuvo un director general estadounidense y que el organismo no asumió responsabilidad por fallos pasados. La administración Trump ha confirmado que no abonará los compromisos correspondientes al periodo 2024-2025, que ascienden a entre 260 y 280 millones de dólares.

Esta ley exige prueba documental de ciudadanía (como certificado de nacimiento o pasaporte) para registrarse o actualizar el voto en elecciones federales, lo que podría afectar a unos 69 millones de mujeres estadounidenses que cambiaron su apellido al casarse, ya que sus certificados de nacimiento no coinciden con sus documentos actuales. El autor predice que los republicanos aprobarán la norma en el Senado a última hora antes de las midterm de 2026, generando una crisis de documentación masiva cuando ya no sea posible corregir discrepancias a tiempo.

A nivel global, el grupo francés vendió 1.628.030 vehículos, sumando turismos y vehículos comerciales ligeros, lo que supone un crecimiento del 3,2 % respecto a 2024. El mayor impulso provino de los turismos, con 1.292.000 unidades matriculadas y un aumento del 10 %, encadenando así tres años consecutivos de crecimiento.

Europa ha sido el principal motor de estos resultados. En el continente, Renault alcanzó el segundo puesto entre los fabricantes, con 1.004.000 vehículos vendidos. Las ventas de turismos crecieron un 7,4 %, muy por encima del crecimiento medio del mercado europeo, situado en el 2,3 %, lo que permitió a la marca alcanzar una cuota del 5,7 %.

El ministro colombiano de Minas y Energía, Edwin Palma, defendió la suspensión como una decisión política orientada a proteger la soberanía energética y la dignidad nacional, subrayando que no se trata de una acción contra el pueblo ecuatoriano. Colombia recuerda que, incluso durante periodos de sequía y crisis energética, ha mantenido el suministro eléctrico a Ecuador, que en el último año obtuvo de Colombia cerca del 8% de la energía que importó.

En solo dos meses y medio, la lista de espera pasó de 2.100 pacientes a 15 de octubre a tan solo 222 el 31 de diciembre de 2025, lo que supone una reducción del 90 %. La demora media también bajó de más de un año a 37 días. DORIA realiza más de 20 pruebas oftalmológicas en 6-8 minutos, mide más de 100 parámetros y genera un informe detallado con imágenes y valoraciones que el oftalmólogo revisa y valida posteriormente. No requiere dilatar la pupila, mejora el confort del paciente y permite cribar patologías leves (el 41,6 % de los casos se resolvieron sin necesidad de atención adicional, principalmente defectos de refracción).

Estas afirmaciones se produjeron en el contexto de sus dudas sobre la lealtad de la alianza atlántica, asegurando que Estados Unidos 'nunca ha necesitado' a la OTAN y que los aliados europeos no han respondido adecuadamente cuando se les ha requerido ayuda.

Políticos británicos de distintos partidos reaccionaron con dureza. La diputada laborista Emily Thornberry, presidenta del comité de asuntos exteriores, lo calificó de 'insulto absoluto' a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en el conflicto, destacando que el Reino Unido siempre ha respondido a las peticiones estadounidenses.

Defendió que Europa debe fortalecerse internamente, invertir mejor y de forma unida en defensa y seguridad, y mostrarse como un bloque sólido ante cualquier amenaza o coacción.

Al recriminar a un grupo de jóvenes por su comportamiento incívico, que incluía romper botellas y causar molestias, fue rodeado y agredido físicamente con patadas, puñetazos y el uso de cinturones. A pesar de la agresión, la víctima logró huir, aunque se percató de que le habían sustraído el teléfono móvil. Gracias a la rápida actuación de varias patrullas de Seguridad Ciudadana, se localizaron y detuvieron a los presuntos agresores.

La incautación de barcos en alta mar por parte de un Estado se considera un acto de guerra, con el riesgo de desencadenar represalias rusas, incluyendo el uso potencial de armas nucleares. Se examinan las capacidades navales de Rusia y del Reino Unido, destacando las limitaciones de ambos bandos para realizar operaciones a gran escala sin apoyo de aliados, principalmente Estados Unidos. También se analiza el riesgo de conflicto en el Báltico y la vulnerabilidad del enclave ruso de Kaliningrado, subrayando que cualquier confrontación directa con la OTAN podría obligar a Rusia a recurrir a medidas extremas.

La operación se desarrolló alrededor de las diez de la mañana en un edificio situado en la aldea de Meicende, donde el fugitivo llevaba varios meses residiendo con la intención de pasar desapercibido.

Durante el dispositivo policial, Vázquez Patiño ofreció una resistencia especialmente peligrosa. Según fuentes policiales citadas por ABC, intentó apuñalar a uno de los agentes del Grupo de Operaciones Especiales (GOE), una unidad de élite, y trató de huir escapando por el tejado del inmueble. Finalmente fue reducido y detenido en el propio edificio, sin que se produjeran heridos graves entre los agentes.

El uso de esta imagen ha provocado numerosas críticas entre usuarios y comentaristas, que consideran inapropiado recurrir a una ilustración artificial cuando existen fotografías reales del accidente. Varios comentarios destacados subrayan que una cosa es emplear infografías para explicar aspectos técnicos o perspectivas imposibles de captar con una cámara —como vistas cenitales o esquemas— y otra muy distinta es sustituir imágenes reales por recreaciones que pueden inducir a error.

Gracias a ejemplares capturados antes del colapso y trasladados a cautiverio (principalmente descendientes de aves llevadas a EE.UU. en 1925), la especie sobrevive exclusivamente en programas de cría coordinados por zoológicos de Europa y Norteamérica. Actualmente, hay alrededor de 200 individuos en estas instalaciones, que actúan como una población de seguridad para preservar la diversidad genética y evitar la endogamia. En 2025, el Zoológico de Chester (Reino Unido) logró un hito importante con el nacimiento de ocho polluelos sanos de dos parejas reproductoras, lo que refuerza la base genética, mejora la capacidad reproductiva y aumenta las posibilidades de futuro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nacen-ocho-polluelos-de-paloma-de-socorro-en-el-zoologico-de-chester-un-avance-clave-para-la-especie-extinta-en-libertad-desde-1972</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nacen-ocho-polluelos-de-paloma-de-socorro-en-el-zoologico-de-chester-un-avance-clave-para-la-especie-extinta-en-libertad-desde-1972</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump critica a España en Davos por no aumentar el gasto en defensa al 5% del PIB y el Gobierno defiende su compromiso con la OTAN]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante su intervención en el Foro Económico Mundial de Davos (Suiza) el 22 de enero de 2026, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, presentó la llamada 'Junta de Paz', un nuevo organismo internacional que busca resolver conflictos al margen de la ONU. En el acto, Trump volvió a criticar duramente a España por ser, según él, el único aliado de la OTAN que no ha aceptado elevar el gasto en defensa al 5% del PIB, frente al objetivo previo del 2%. Acusó al país de querer 'aprovecharse' y advirtió: 'Vamos a tener que hablar con España'. Esta no es la primera vez que Trump presiona al Gobierno español por esta cuestión, ya que Pedro Sánchez ha rechazado en reiteradas ocasiones subir el gasto militar a esa cifra, argumentando que supondría recortes en servicios públicos y el Estado de bienestar.

Según los científicos, el magma sigue una 'memoria' que permanece estable mientras se encuentra estancado; cuando se produce un cambio en esa sismicidad, la erupción es inminente. Este sistema no solo avisa del inicio de la erupción, sino que también puede identificar cuándo el volcán comienza a perder fuerza, facilitando la planificación del retorno de la población evacuada y la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas. La erupción del volcán Tajogaite en La Palma en 2021 sirvió como base para desarrollar el modelo, gracias a la recopilación de datos hora a hora durante los 86 días de activ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-espanoles-desarrollan-metodo-para-anticipar-erupciones-volcanicas-hasta-48-horas-antes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-espanoles-desarrollan-metodo-para-anticipar-erupciones-volcanicas-hasta-48-horas-antes</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ucrania utiliza drones aéreos para transportar y desplegar robots terrestres de combate cerca del frente]]></title><description><![CDATA[La guerra en Ucrania ha evolucionado rápidamente hacia un modelo donde drones y robots protagonizan el combate, reduciendo al mínimo la exposición de soldados humanos. Una táctica reciente y sorprendente consiste en emplear drones aéreos grandes como medio de transporte improvisado para llevar robots terrestres (UGV) pequeños hasta posiciones cercanas al enemigo, soltándolos en el lugar idóneo. De este modo se evitan los trayectos terrestres más peligrosos, plagados de minas, artillería, barro y detección enemiga, que causan numerosas bajas.

Esta innovación, descrita por mandos ucranianos y confirmada por la empresa Ark Robotics (que suministra robots a más de 20 brigadas), ha sorprendido incluso a sus propios fabricantes. El CEO de Ark, bajo seudónimo por seguridad, reconoció que la idea es simple pero extremadamente lógica: los drones aéreos superan con rapidez zonas de alto riesgo, mientras que los robots terrestres destacan una vez desplegados, ya que pueden infiltrarse en trinche]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ucrania-utiliza-drones-aereos-para-transportar-y-desplegar-robots-terrestres-de-combate-cerca-del-frente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ucrania-utiliza-drones-aereos-para-transportar-y-desplegar-robots-terrestres-de-combate-cerca-del-frente</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno español propone acabar con el anonimato en redes sociales para reforzar la responsabilidad online]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro de España ha expresado su intención de eliminar las cuentas anónimas en las redes sociales, argumentando que esta medida contribuiría a reducir el acoso, las amenazas y la difusión de desinformación en línea.

La iniciativa ha generado un debate intenso sobre privacidad, libertad de expresión y seguridad digital.

A través del personaje de Enrique, elevado a héroe por una sociedad hedonista y decadente, la obra retrata el ascenso y la caída de unos valores colectivos basados en la competición, la idolatría y la obediencia acrítica. El deporte aparece simbolizado como una “cucaña” que promete éxito y gloria, pero que acaba revelando el vacío moral y humano que sostiene ese ideal.

La reseña subraya el carácter despiadado de la crítica social que recorre toda la pieza. García Calvo ridiculiza las pasiones de un pueblo entendido como masa, capaz de emocionarse con gestas deportivas mientras acepta sin cuestionamiento una estructura social grotesca, estatista y deshumanizada. En este contexto destaca la figura del “Padredelpueblo”, un personaje esperpéntico que encarna el adoctr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pasion-la-farsa-tragica-de-agustin-garcia-calvo-como-critica-radical-a-la-sociedad-contemporanea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pasion-la-farsa-tragica-de-agustin-garcia-calvo-como-critica-radical-a-la-sociedad-contemporanea</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Víctima de Jeffrey Epstein denuncia ante tribunal la demora del Departamento de Justicia en publicar los archivos completos del caso]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una de las sobrevivientes de la red de explotación sexual de Jeffrey Epstein, Haley Robson, ha enviado una carta a un tribunal del distrito sureste de Nueva York en la que critica duramente al Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos por no haber publicado de forma íntegra los archivos relacionados con el caso, tal como obliga la ley aprobada por el Congreso y firmada por el presidente Donald Trump a finales de 2025 (Epstein Files Transparency Act). En la misiva, Robson califica esta omisión como un «secretismo» que no es solo un problema burocrático, sino algo profundamente personal para las víctimas, ya que perpetúa el mismo encubrimiento que permitió que los abusos continuaran durante años sin ser controlados.

NonUSA ha alcanzado el primer puesto en la App Store danesa, tras partir del puesto 441. Estas herramientas permiten escanear códigos de barras o fotos de productos para determinar su país de origen, alertando si son fabricados en Estados Unidos y sugiriendo alternativas locales o europeas.

El fenómeno responde directamente a las repetidas declaraciones del presidente Donald Trump sobre la posible adquisición o mayor control estadounidense de Groenlandia, territorio autónomo bajo soberanía danesa.

La acusación principal es que el banco canceló unilateralmente varias cuentas bancarias de Trump por motivos políticos, tras el asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, cuando Trump alentó a sus seguidores a impedir la certificación de la victoria electoral de Joe Biden. La demanda, interpuesta en un tribunal estatal del condado de Miami-Dade (Florida), alega violación de los códigos éticos del banco, difamación comercial, incumplimiento del pacto de buena fe y trato justo, así como infracción de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales y Engañosas de Florida.

En concreto, criticó la encuesta conjunta del New York Times y el Siena College Research Institute, afirmando que estaba inclinada a favor de los demócratas y anunciando acciones legales para exigir que se conserven los registros internos de la encuesta. Según estas encuestas recientes, su aprobación se encuentra en torno al 35-40%, con un desaprobación superior al 60%, reflejando un debilitamiento notable incluso en áreas donde Trump solía mostrar fortaleza, como economía, inmigración y seguridad fronteriza.

Durante su visita a Washington y reuniones con legisladores estadounidenses, Machado defendió que la liberación de Venezuela era solo el primer paso hacia la eliminación del comunismo y la dictadura en América Latina. Sus comentarios provocaron críticas inmediatas en redes sociales, donde muchos usuarios la calificaron de hipócrita y cuestionaron su idoneidad para recibir el Nobel de la Paz.

En una entrevista con el editor jefe de Bloomberg News, Milei subrayó que el peso de China en la economía global hace inevitable el comercio con Pekín, incluso mientras su Gobierno busca avanzar hacia un acuerdo de libre comercio con Washington.

Las declaraciones se produjeron minutos después de que Milei participara en un evento junto al presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, reforzando la imagen de equilibrio que intenta proyectar entre ambas potencias.

El acto tuvo lugar en el Kennedy Center durante una fiesta organizada por Republicans for National Renewal, un grupo de derecha que promueve la posibilidad de que Donald Trump aspire a un tercer mandato presidencial, algo que actualmente sería inconstitucional. El pastel fue presentado de forma irónica como el “estado número 51”, en clara alusión a la reiterada propuesta de Trump de adquirir la isla ártica.

Al encuentro asistieron varios legisladores republicanos, entre ellos Anna Paulina Luna, Abe Hamadeh y Andy Ogles. Luna fue quien cortó la primera porción del pastel, mientras algunos asistentes advertían en tono jocoso de que el gesto podía provocar un escándalo internacional.

El autor descarta excusas indulgentes y apunta a una ejecución deficiente de la soldadura o problemas en el proceso de laminado del raíl. Sin embargo, enfatiza que este incidente no es aislado, sino que revela un problema más profundo y estructural en la red de alta velocidad española.

Según cuatro fuentes citadas por The Guardian, estas negociaciones comenzaron en otoño de 2025, tras una conversación entre Trump y Maduro en noviembre, en la que el presidente estadounidense exigió la salida de Maduro, que fue rechazada. Delcy Rodríguez habría asegurado a los estadounidenses estar dispuesta a asumir las consecuencias y colaborar con la transición, aunque sin actuar activamente para derrocar a Maduro. La familia Rodríguez mantuvo además vínculos con Qatar, lo que facilitó la mediación y el acceso a la Casa Blanca. El objetivo principal de Estados Unidos era asegurar estabilidad y evitar un posible Estado fallido tras la salida]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-mantuvo-contactos-secretos-con-estados-unidos-antes-del-intento-de-captura-de-maduro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-mantuvo-contactos-secretos-con-estados-unidos-antes-del-intento-de-captura-de-maduro</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homenaje a Inmaculada Ramos Tapia: un libro de memorias compartidas tras su fallecimiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, escrito por Antonio Jiménez-Blanco Carrillo de Albornoz y publicado el 19 de enero de 2026 en Global Politics and Law, es una sentida necrológica en homenaje a María Inmaculada Ramos Tapia, profesora de Derecho Penal de la Universidad de Granada, fallecida en agosto de 2024 con menos de 60 años. Destaca su destacada trayectoria académica, especialmente su doctorado en el año 2000 sobre el delito de prevaricación judicial (publicado tras la sentencia del caso Gómez de Liaño-Prisa), así como su intensa labor en gestión universitaria y, desde 2023, en la Fundación Euroárabe de Altos Estudios en Granada. El texto resalta no solo su perfil profesional, sino también su personalidad vital, empática y llena de joie de vivre. Lo más novedoso es la iniciativa de su familia (marido e hijos) de publicar un libro titulado 'Memorias compartidas. Inmaculada Ramos en nuestro corazón', presentado en septiembre de 2025.

Durante la entrevista, Roma repasó algunos de los hitos más importantes de su carrera deportiva, entre ellos el haber ganado el Rally Dakar tanto en motos como en coches, un logro reservado a muy pocos. Sin embargo, el momento más emotivo de su intervención llegó cuando habló de su experiencia personal con la enfermedad.

En 2022, a Nani Roma le diagnosticaron un cáncer de vejiga, del que consiguió recuperarse tras un duro proceso médico que culminó con éxito en 2023, permitiéndole incluso volver a la competición profesional.

La advertencia se produjo durante una entrevista en Fox Business en el Foro Económico Mundial en Davos. Trump afirmó que 'tenemos todas las cartas', aunque no especificó qué medidas concretas podrían adoptarse. La especulación surgió tras la planificación de un aumento de aranceles a productos de ocho países europeos, lo que podría haber llevado a Europa a vender billones en bonos y acciones estadounidenses. Esto podría afectar a los mercados financieros, ya tensionados por las intenciones de Trump sobre la isla ártica. El acuerdo marco que evitó la escalada incluye la promesa estadounidense de no imponer nuevos aranceles, la instalación de misiles en el territorio danés semi-autónomo y la regulación de derechos minerales para limitar la influencia china, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-sobre-posibles-represalias-si-europa-vende-activos-de-eeuu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-sobre-posibles-represalias-si-europa-vende-activos-de-eeuu</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Siete hombres condenados a 97 años por violar a una joven en Zaragoza durante dos días]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Audiencia Provincial de Zaragoza ha condenado a siete hombres a un total de 97 años de prisión por la agresión sexual continuada de una joven durante dos días en junio de 2020 en un piso del barrio de San José. Los acusados estaban vinculados a la banda juvenil Dominican's Don’t Play. Según la sentencia, la víctima fue llevada al piso tras pasar la tarde bebiendo alcohol y consumiendo marihuana, donde se le obligó a mantener relaciones sexuales mientras se encontraba en estado de confusión y aturdimiento. Para justificar estas agresiones, los condenados alegaron un supuesto ritual de curación para “sacar el demonio” que la joven llevaba dentro. Varios de los actos fueron grabados con el móvil de uno de los agresores y descubiertos por la Policía Nacional durante la desarticulación de la banda en 2021. Los vídeos mostraban a la víctima quejándose y exhausta, mientras los agresores se reían de ella.

Teo Moreno, coordinador de comunicación de SEMAF, ha explicado que los profesionales reportan incidencias diarias por vibraciones en las vías, pero hasta ahora no se imponían límites de velocidad para no afectar la operativa de la alta velocidad, considerada la 'joya de la corona'. Afirma que fuera de España no se entiende que un aviso por vibraciones no conlleve restricciones inmediatas, y que estas vibraciones aceleran el desgaste de vías y trenes, creando un ciclo vicioso que puede llevar al colapso de materiales.

El club mantuvo una línea de defensa de la libertad de expresión y del derecho a un referéndum pactado, sin apoyar explícitamente la independencia. Comunicados oficiales, declaraciones de dirigentes y jugadores, y decisiones como la presencia en actos de la Diada o el Concert per la Llibertat muestran una estrategia clara basada en valores democráticos y diálogo.

El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea (TJUE) condenó a España por incumplir la Directiva de aguas residuales urbanas, señalando 12 puntos críticos en Tenerife de un total de 29 a nivel nacional, con deficiencias en colectores, tratamiento y control. Aunque la sentencia de diciembre de 2025 no impone sanción inmediata, abre la posibilidad de multas si no se corrigen los problemas de forma urgente. Datos del Gobierno de Canarias de 2025 registran 403 puntos de vertidos, más del 50% sin autorización, concentrándose principalmente en Tenerife. Algunos episodios recientes, como el cierre casi un año de Playa Jardín por altos niveles de E. coli, reflejan la magnitud del problema.

El banco se pregunta si este gasto masivo llegará a compensarse con beneficios reales en productividad y rentabilidad.

El informe destaca que la euforia actual en torno a la IA está impulsando subidas en bolsa de empresas como Nvidia y otras del S&P 500, pero estas alzas ya incorporan expectativas muy optimistas de aumento de productividad (lo que implicaría automatización, despidos y reducción de costes laborales).

Hubo un 47 % más de vendedores que de compradores activos, lo que equivale a aproximadamente 631.000 vendedores adicionales sin demanda suficiente. El número de compradores activos cayó hasta un mínimo histórico de 1,34 millones, el nivel más bajo desde abril de 2020, al inicio de la pandemia.

Este cambio drástico se debe a varios factores: los precios de las viviendas siguen siendo muy elevados, las tasas hipotecarias continúan altas (alrededor del 6 %), despidos laborales, e incertidumbre económica y política. Esto contrasta con el mercado de 2021, cuando los compradores superaban ampliamente a los vendedores y se producían guerras de ofertas. El mercado se equilibró en febrero de 2024, pero desde entonces los vendedores han dominado claramente.

Según Fesser, Trump actúa como un 'gángster internacional' y solo llega hasta donde Europa esté dispuesta a permitirlo. Considera que la mejor respuesta es tratar a Estados Unidos como un adversario y plantarle cara de forma unida.

Explica que históricamente EE.UU. ha sido el garante de la seguridad para el libre comercio mundial, a cambio de que otros países invirtieran en su economía.

Esta decisión ha generado una gran polémica dentro del país, ya que muchos ciudadanos y partidos políticos consideran que la elección de estas personas podría agravar las tensiones sociales y políticas, especialmente en lo relacionado con la memoria histórica y los derechos humanos. En la actualidad, Kast enfrenta la presión de demostrar que su gobierno es inclusivo y respetuoso con la democracia y los derechos fundamentales.

El acuerdo previo establecía aranceles estadounidenses del 15% sobre productos europeos (frente al 30% amenazado inicialmente) a cambio de inversiones europeas en EE.UU.

Sin mencionar directamente a Donald Trump, Carney criticó cómo las grandes potencias utilizan la integración económica como arma de coerción, aranceles y control de cadenas de suministro para imponer sus intereses, dejando a las potencias medianas en posición de debilidad si negocian por separado.

Inspirándose en un ensayo de Václav Havel sobre vivir en la mentira, Carney afirmó que ya no se debe fingir que el viejo sistema funciona y que la nostalgia no es estrategia.

En apenas dos décadas, el país ha pasado de un sistema ferroviario saturado y precario a la red de alta velocidad más extensa del mundo, con más de 50.000 kilómetros en servicio y planes para alcanzar los 70.000 en 2035, conectando todas las ciudades de más de medio millón de habitantes. Este despliegue ha transformado la movilidad interna, reducido distancias y reforzado la cohesión social entre regiones muy dispares.

El único episodio grave que puso en cuestión este modelo fue el accidente de Wenzhou en 2011, cuando un tren detenido por un fallo eléctrico fue embestido por otro en un viaducto, provocando la caída de varios vagones, 40 muertos y más de 200 heridos. El suceso supuso un duro golpe para la confianza ciudadana en el medio de transporte más utilizado del país y obligó al Gobierno a reaccionar con medidas inmediatas y excepcionales.

El sistema electoral estadounidense está fuertemente descentralizado debido al federalismo: cada estado organiza, administra y certifica sus propias elecciones de forma autónoma, sin que exista un organismo electoral federal centralizado ni un Ministerio del Interior que controle los resultados. Ni el presidente ni ninguna agencia federal tienen autoridad directa sobre los miles de funcionarios y cargos electos locales y estatales que gestionan el proceso.

Aunque la Casa Blanca podría intentar tácticas de intimidación (despliegue de ICE, Guardia Nacional, etc.), el tamaño del país y la escasa plantilla federal hacen que estas acciones sean muy limitadas en impacto real.

Junto a un grupo de unas doce mujeres, realizaba entrevistas en la calle (micro-trottoir) a viandantes que consentían participar, preguntando sobre el auge del islamismo y su impacto percibido en los derechos de las mujeres en Francia. Según el diario local Le Progrès, una entrevistada cambió de opinión tras haber respondido parcialmente, solicitó borrar las grabaciones y denunció el hecho a la policía. Los agentes intervinieron y detuvieron a Faedda argumentando que la acción no había sido declarada previamente en la prefectura, tratándola como una manifestación no autorizada en lugar de una actividad periodística o de recogida de opiniones.

En este contexto, el ministro de Exteriores, José Manuel Albares, visitó India para proponer elevar la relación bilateral a 'asociación estratégica', equiparándola a la que España mantiene con países como China o Brasil. Sánchez tiene previsto viajar a India en febrero de 2026, coincidiendo con el 'Año Dual' entre ambos países, y planea otra visita a China durante el año. Estas acciones se enmarcan en la defensa del multilateralismo, la unidad europea y la búsqueda de alternativas ante el proteccionismo de Trump, quien en Davos criticó a Europa y lanzó advertencias sobre Groenlandia, aunque posteriormente moderó su postura sobre el uso de la fuerza o aranceles.

La estrategia, aún en una fase inicial, se inspiraría en el esquema aplicado previamente contra Venezuela, donde Washington intentó presionar al entorno del poder político y militar para forzar un desenlace favorable a sus intereses sin asumir costes directos.

Trump ha endurecido en las últimas semanas su retórica contra La Habana, amenazando con cortar totalmente el suministro de petróleo y emplazando al Gobierno cubano a negociar “antes de que sea demasiado tarde”.

Según el texto, Rutte habría mostrado una sumisión extrema hacia Donald Trump, calificándolo de 'líder del mundo libre' y afirmando que la OTAN no puede concebirse sin él. Además, defiende las pretensiones estadounidenses sobre Groenlandia al argumentar que es necesario proteger el Ártico de la influencia de Rusia y China, lo que el artículo interpreta como una aceptación implícita del dominio sobre el territorio danés. Rutte critica a países como España, Italia o Bélgica por no alcanzar el 2% del PIB en gasto en defensa sin la presión de Trump, obviando que dicho compromiso se estableció en 2014 bajo Obama.

Según el informe European Electricity Review 2026, elaborado por el think tank británico Ember, ambas fuentes renovables alcanzaron el 30,1% de la generación eléctrica en la UE, frente al 29% procedente de carbón, gas y derivados del petróleo.

Este avance se explica principalmente por el fuerte crecimiento de la energía solar, que aumentó un 20,1% respecto a 2024, encadenando cuatro años consecutivos de incrementos similares. La solar aportó el 13,2% del total de electricidad generada en la UE, mientras que la eólica alcanzó el 16,9%. Desde 2020, la contribución conjunta de ambas tecnologías ha pasado del 19,7% al 30,1%, lo que para Ember refleja un cambio estructural en el modelo energético europeo.

La superintendenta del distrito explicó que, cuando llegó al lugar, el coche del padre seguía en marcha y agentes federales ya habían sacado al menor del vehículo.

Según el testimonio de la responsable escolar, un agente llevó al niño hasta la puerta de su casa y le indicó que llamara para comprobar si había más personas dentro, una actuación que calificó de utilización del menor como “cebo”.

Las llamas fueron detectadas alrededor de las 20:30 horas en una zona próxima a la localidad nijareña de Rodalquilar, conocida por su pasado minero ligado a las antiguas explotaciones de oro.

Desde el primer momento, el fuego movilizó un importante dispositivo del Servicio de Extinción de Incendios Forestales de Andalucía (INFOCA). En las labores de extinción participaron tres grupos de bomberos forestales, un técnico de operaciones, un agente de Medio Ambiente y dos autobombas. Las tareas se desarrollaron en condiciones complicadas, especialmente por las fuertes rachas de viento que han azotado la comarca, un factor que dificulta notablemente el control del perímetro y aumenta el riesgo de propagación.

El problema es especialmente grave en los centros de gran tamaño gestionados por la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS), donde se dan situaciones extremas como la presencia de una sola enfermera para atender a hasta 600 residentes durante turnos nocturnos.

El informe de la Cámara de Cuentas correspondiente a 2024 ha revelado que el Gobierno autonómico autorizó el traspaso de más de 61 millones de euros del presupuesto de la AMAS para financiar actividad sanitaria prestada en 2021 por la Fundación Jiménez Díaz, perteneciente al grupo privado Quirón.

Según la resolución, Ceuta y Canarias llevan meses alertando de un desbordamiento grave de sus sistemas de acogida, con una ocupación que triplica su capacidad ordinaria. Mantener a los menores en esas condiciones, señala el tribunal, sería “gravemente perjudicial” para su bienestar, por lo que frenar los traslados solo serviría para prolongar una situación ya calificada como dañina.

A partir de su libro de relatos ‘Mari contra la pobreza’, Montalbán utiliza la ficción como herramienta para visibilizar situaciones cotidianas de precariedad que suelen permanecer ocultas o normalizadas.

El autor explica que la sociedad identifica con facilidad la pobreza severa, pero tiende a ignorar la pobreza “a secas”, pese a que una parte muy significativa de la población murciana vive en riesgo de exclusión. Esta invisibilización se debe, según él, a la persistente idea de que la pobreza es culpa de quien la padece y al rechazo colectivo a asumir que sus causas son sociales y políticas. Reconocerla implicaría cuestionar el modelo económico y social existente.

Se trata de una plantilla de mano con una antigüedad mínima de 67.800 años, lo que la sitúa unos 15.000 años por delante del anterior registro más antiguo, también localizado en esta misma isla. El hallazgo ha sido publicado en la revista científica Nature y refuerza la idea de que el arte y el pensamiento simbólico surgieron muy pronto en la historia del ser humano.

La investigación ha sido liderada por científicos de las universidades australianas de Griffith y Southern Cross, en colaboración con expertos de la Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación de Indonesia (BRIN). Tras décadas con escasa exploración arqueológica en esta zona desde los primeros hallazgos en 1977, el equipo ha logrado identificar 44 yacimientos, de los cuales 14 eran completamente desconocidos hasta ahora.

El alemán destaca la diferencia entre picos puntuales de alto nivel y la consistencia prolongada, admitiendo que en su caso alcanzó su mejor momento alrededor de 2010-2011, con años fuertes posteriores como 2015, 2017 y 2018, antes de notar un declive en 2019-2020 que no reconoció en su momento. Contrasta su percepción con la de Fernando Alonso, afirmando que el asturiano probablemente diría que siempre ha estado en su mejor nivel debido a su gran seguridad en sí mismo. Vettel explica cómo la familia, especialmente sus hijos, influyó en su deseo de reducir viajes y priorizar la vida personal, lo que marcó un punto de inflexión en 2019.

En un monólogo cargado de humor y reflexión, criticó la presión social que muchas personas ejercen para que todo el mundo consuma alcohol en celebraciones, cumpleaños, bodas o reuniones. Explicó que, para alguien con alcoholismo, una simple 'copita' para brindar puede desencadenar una recaída, ya que detrás de esa primera copa visualizan muchas más hasta llegar a un consumo descontrolado. Giró utilizó ejemplos cotidianos, como rechazar alcohol en la boda de su prima Covadonga, y pidió empatía: no tachar de aburrido o de mala suerte a quien opta por agua o refrescos sin alcohol. Recordó que en Alcohólicos Anónimos se considera el alcoholismo una condición permanente que se controla día a día, no algo que se cura.

El establecimiento bajará la persiana a mediados de febrero.

Fundada por tres socios —Alfonso, Curro y Gonzalo—, Tipos Infames nació como un proyecto independiente con la ambición de crear una librería de referencia en el centro de Madrid.

Además, se ha aprobado un donativo de 60.000 toneladas de arroz como ayuda alimentaria. Esta información fue transmitida por el embajador de China en La Habana, Hua Xin, durante una reunión con el presidente cubano, Miguel Díaz-Canel, en el Palacio de la Revolución.

Díaz-Canel destacó la intensa actividad del diplomático chino en la isla, especialmente el acto de entrega del lunes de la primera parte de un donativo anterior de 30.000 toneladas de arroz. Esta nueva ayuda llega en un momento crítico para Cuba, que enfrenta una grave crisis económica y energética. La isla sufre escasez crónica de productos básicos, frecuentes apagones debido a averías en centrales eléctricas obsoletas y falta de combustibles.

En el tercer trimestre de 2025, el 1% más rico de los hogares controlaba el 31,7% de toda la riqueza del país, la mayor proporción registrada desde que existen estadísticas comparables. En términos absolutos, este grupo acumula unos 55 billones de dólares en activos, una cifra similar a la riqueza total del 90% inferior de la población estadounidense.

Los economistas advierten de que esta concentración no es un fenómeno puntual, sino una tendencia que se ha intensificado especialmente desde la pandemia. Mientras que el crecimiento del patrimonio de las clases medias y bajas se ha estancado o ralentizado, las grandes fortunas han seguido aumentando a gran velocidad. Un informe reciente de Oxfam señala que la riqueza de los multimillonarios creció en 2025 a un ritmo tres veces superior al promedio anual de los cinco años anteriores.

Inicialmente, sus operadores afirmaron que la suspensión no estaba relacionada con su reciente scraping masivo de datos de Spotify (incluyendo metadatos y canciones de las pistas más reproducidas, con un total estimado de 300 TB). Sin embargo, documentos judiciales desclasificados revelan que sí fue consecuencia directa de una demanda presentada por Spotify junto a las grandes discográficas Sony, Warner y Universal Music Group (UMG) en el Tribunal de Distrito del Sur de Nueva York.

La demanda se presentó sellada a finales de diciembre de 2025 y el 2 de enero de 2026 se concedió una orden de restricción temporal (TRO) de manera ex parte, sin notificar a Anna’s Archive para evitar que publicaran inmediatamente los archivos de audio scrapeados.

Según el calendario original, la infraestructura debía estar en funcionamiento en 2010. Posteriormente, una revisión del plan realizada en 2020 fijó 2023 como nueva fecha objetivo. Ninguna de ellas se cumplió. En 2024, la Comisión Europea situó la posible finalización en 2030, pero el propio informe recoge que los promotores del proyecto ya apuntan a 2035 como horizonte más realista, lo que supondría un retraso superior a dos décadas.

Buffett compró unos grandes almacenes en Baltimore durante el auge de los centros comerciales y se encontró con que la competencia instalaba escaleras mecánicas para atraer clientes. Él replicó la acción, pero pronto se dio cuenta de que la inversión no aumentaba las ventas ni atraía más clientes; simplemente mantenía a los que ya tenía, generando costes innecesarios. El economista Michael Burry utiliza esta analogía para advertir que empresas como Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Palantir o Meta podrían estar repitiendo el mismo patrón con la IA: gastando grandes cantidades de dinero para mantener una ventaja percibida, pero sin un retorno real proporcional a la inversión.

Tras sufrir un grave accidente de tráfico, Princio presentaba una lesión muy severa en la pierna izquierda. En su país, la única opción médica planteada era la amputación, una intervención que, además, suponía un alto riesgo vital debido a la infección y a la falta de recursos sanitarios.

Su destino cambió cuando un grupo de médicos asturianos, voluntarios de la ONG HASHTG (Asociación Humanitaria para la Formación Sanitaria), conocieron su caso durante una campaña médica en la leprosería de Farafangana, una de las zonas más pobres de Madagascar.

Según el afectado y vídeos revisados por Associated Press, los agentes enmascarados forzaron la puerta, apuntaron con armas a la familia y detuvieron a Thao a punta de pistola mientras dormía la siesta. Lo sacaron esposado a la calle en pleno invierno, con temperaturas bajo cero, vestido solo con ropa interior, sandalias y una manta sobre los hombros, ante la mirada de su nieto de cuatro años que lloraba. La familia asegura que los agentes no mostraron ninguna orden ni permitieron inicialmente que Thao mostrara su identificación.

Los hechos investigados se remontan al periodo comprendido entre 2016 y 2021 y están relacionados con la tributación del combustible importado y distribuido en las islas a través de su filial Petrocan. Según el Ministerio Público, la empresa habría declarado como fuelóleo un producto que en realidad era gasóleo, lo que supuso una notable reducción del impuesto autonómico sobre combustibles.

La diferencia fiscal entre ambos productos es considerable: mientras el fuelóleo tributa a 0,56 euros por tonelada métrica, el gasóleo lo hace a 222 euros por cada mil litros. Para la Fiscalía, esta práctica fue deliberada y sistemática, con el objetivo de defraudar a la Hacienda pública canaria.

El mandatario repitió varias veces que no se pueden tolerar elecciones amañadas.

A lo largo de su historia ha documentado la evolución del vuelo, desde los aviones de hélice hasta los modernos jets de negocios y las aeronaves eléctricas emergentes. Es conocida por sus detallados 'Pilot Reports', realizados por aviadores expertos que evalúan nuevas aeronaves, así como por sus columnas técnicas sobre seguridad, navegación y meteorología. Más allá de los aspectos mecánicos, la revista transmite la pasión por volar mediante impresionantes fotografías aéreas y relatos que celebran la libertad del cielo.

Según el mandatario, este entendimiento preliminar sería beneficioso tanto para Estados Unidos como para el conjunto de países aliados.

Rutte confirmó posteriormente que la descripción de Trump era correcta, aunque evitó ofrecer detalles concretos sobre el contenido del acuerdo, subrayando que las conversaciones continuarán.

Tras el abandono de unos inquilinos en 2021, Alberto, que atravesaba graves problemas de adicciones, se instaló en el piso y permitió que otras personas lo usaran, presuntamente como narcopiso. Ante esta situación, la familia de Elisa contrató a una empresa privada de desocupación para recuperar el inmueble.

El encargado de esa empresa, Richard Dantas, logró que las personas que ocupaban la vivienda se marcharan y cambió la cerradura. Sin embargo, según la versión de la familia, acabó quedándose a vivir en el piso desde 2023, pese a no existir un contrato formal de alquiler ni una compraventa cerrada. La familia sostiene que el pago del servicio se hizo sin recibos y que Dantas fue retrasando su salida con promesas incumplidas de compra del inmueble.

El sistema permite simular en laboratorio condiciones extremas que en la naturaleza tardarían siglos o milenios en desarrollarse, acelerando procesos físicos mediante la aplicación de hipergravedad a modelos a escala reducida. De esta forma, se 'comprime' el tiempo y el espacio experimentalmente: por ejemplo, se ha probado la estabilidad de una presa de casi 300 metros utilizando un modelo de solo tres metros sometido a unas 100 veces la gravedad terrestre, reproduciendo tensiones reales en poco tiempo.

Los primeros vuelos, realizados el 21 de enero de 1976, fueron simultáneos: British Airways conectó Londres-Heathrow con Baréin, mientras que Air France unió París-Charles de Gaulle con Río de Janeiro, con escala en Dakar. Este avión supersónico, fruto de la colaboración entre la británica British Aircraft Corporation y la francesa Aérospatiale tras un tratado de 1962, alcanzaba velocidades de Mach 2 y altitudes de hasta 18.300 metros gracias a sus motores Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 y sus alas en delta. A pesar de sus logros, sólo se construyeron 20 unidades, siendo operadas comercialmente únicamente por British Airways y Air France debido a los altos costos, la crisis del petróleo de 1973, el ruido, el impacto ambiental y la limitada demanda internacional.

Estos centros, construidos por empresas privadas que reciben un canon anual de la Administración y explotan zonas comerciales, facturaron 563.894.273,65 euros entre 2021 y 2023.

El análisis, que abarca desde enero de 2021 hasta agosto de 2024, señala incumplimientos graves como la falta de trámites esenciales en los reequilibrios financieros concedidos a los concesionarios (sin expediente previo de modificación contractual, audiencia o informes jurídicos), errores en la imputación presupuestaria del canon y de gastos no contemplados en el contrato (incluidos servicios por]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/informe-de-intervencion-detecta-deficiencias-y-errores-en-la-gestion-economica-de-siete-hospitales-publico-privados-de-la-comunidad-de-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/informe-de-intervencion-detecta-deficiencias-y-errores-en-la-gestion-economica-de-siete-hospitales-publico-privados-de-la-comunidad-de-madrid</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Hospital Costa del Sol sufre grave falta de médicos especialistas: 28 de 30 plazas desiertas por precariedad laboral]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Sindicato Médico de Málaga ha alertado de la grave situación que atraviesa el Hospital Universitario Costa del Sol, en Marbella, debido a la precariedad laboral y la infradotación crónica que sufre el centro. Este hospital atiende a una población censada de 460.000 habitantes (aunque en la práctica es superior), pero solo dispone de 394 camas, lo que equivale a 0,86 camas por cada 1.000 habitantes. Esta cifra está muy por debajo de la media andaluza (1,9 camas por 1.000) y de la media nacional del Sistema Nacional de Salud (2,4 camas por 1.000), según datos del Ministerio de Sanidad.

Además, la financiación es insuficiente en comparación con otros hospitales: por ejemplo, el Hospital Comarcal de Osuna, que atiende al 35% de la población del Costa del Sol, invierte cantidades similares en radiólogos, mientras que el Hospital Valme, con un censo parecido, recibe un 37% más de inversión en este apartado.

Según Powell, el rey emérito ejerció una influencia directa y pragmática en momentos clave, amparado por un amplio consenso político interno y por una relación fluida con los presidentes del Gobierno, especialmente con los de izquierdas.

Uno de los aspectos más relevantes abordados es la cuestión de Gibraltar. Powell sostiene que, en conversaciones privadas con responsables británicos a comienzos de los años ochenta, Juan Carlos I llegó a admitir que el objetivo real de España no era recuperar el Peñón, sino garantizar el ingreso en la Comunidad Económica Europea. La reivindicación de Gibraltar, explica, servía sobre todo para gestionar la opinión pública, sin poner en riesgo la priorid]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-juan-carlos-i-en-la-politica-exterior-espanola-y-la-realpolitik-sobre-gibraltar-y-europa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-juan-carlos-i-en-la-politica-exterior-espanola-y-la-realpolitik-sobre-gibraltar-y-europa</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crítica historiográfica al libro de Josep M.

Solé Sabaté, titulado 'La Cerdanya republicana i antifranquista, Joan Solé Cristòfol'. El texto denuncia el carácter apologético y poco riguroso de la obra, que presenta una biografía elogiosa del alcalde de Bellver durante la Guerra Civil, Joan Solé Cristòfol, omitiendo evidencias documentales que cuestionan la versión oficial de los 'Hechos de Bellver' del 27 de abril de 1937. Según el autor de la recensión, estos hechos no fueron un combate defensivo contra un asalto anarquista liderado por Antonio Martín Escudero ('El Cojo de Málaga'), sino una emboscada y asesinato premeditado en el que participó el hermano del alcalde, Emili Solé, con implicación de milicianos del PSUC, ERC y otros grupos.

La imagen, descontextualizada deliberadamente, fue utilizada para generar indignación y alimentar una narrativa de desprestigio contra la comunicadora.

Tal y como ha explicado el activista contra la desinformación Julián Macías, la escena difundida corresponde en realidad a un momento en el que Maldonado y su interlocutor estaban hablando de la solidaridad mostrada por el pueblo de Adamuz tras la tragedia. La sonrisa de la periodista no tenía relación alguna con el accidente en sí, sino que respondía a un gesto de complicidad durante la conversación. Basta con ver el vídeo completo para comprobar que la acusación carece de fundamento.

La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha activado la alerta naranja por fenómenos costeros en todo el litoral asturiano a partir de las 16:00 horas. Emergencias del 112 ha emitido un aviso especial recomendando evitar playas, paseos marítimos, espigones, muelles y zonas cercanas a la costa, no estacionar en áreas vulnerables a la pleamar y aplazar actividades náuticas o deportivas en el mar, además de asegurar bien las embarcaciones.

Paralelamente, se registran rachas de viento muy intensas, siendo la más alta del país 124 km/h en Vega de Ario (Picos de Europa), con aviso amarillo por vendaval en el suroeste, la cordillera y los Picos.

La tragedia se produjo cuando un tren Iryo descarriló en una recta, impactando posteriormente con un tren Alvia que circulaba en dirección contraria. Según las investigaciones iniciales de la Guardia Civil y la Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF), la clave del siniestro parece estar en un trozo de vía que faltaba y que provocó el descarrilamiento del sexto vagón del Iryo. Todas las ruedas del tren muestran muescas compatibles con la rotura de la vía, aunque se investiga si otros trenes que pasaron previamente también presentan daños. No se superó la velocidad permitida y se descarta un fallo humano, ya que los sistemas de seguridad y frenado automático (ERTMS nivel 2) habrían activado el frenado de encontrarse con un obstáculo.

Rutte subrayó que, sin la presión de Trump, este aumento de inversión probablemente no se habría producido. Además, respaldó los argumentos de Trump sobre la necesidad de proteger el Ártico de la influencia de Rusia y China, aunque señaló que el asunto de Groenlandia, objeto de la atención internacional por las declaraciones de Trump sobre la isla, debía resolverse por vías diplomáticas y no era la prioridad principal de la OTAN.

Las movilizaciones se han producido en Washington DC, Houston, Atlanta, Miami, Los Ángeles y otras localidades, en una semana de protestas que comenzó tras la celebración del Día de Martin Luther King y que culminará con una huelga convocada en Minneapolis.

El detonante de esta oleada de manifestaciones ha sido el asesinato de Renée Nicole Good, una mujer de 37 años y madre de tres hijos, que murió tiroteada por un agente del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en Minneapolis. En lugar de centrar la atención en la actuación del agente implicado, el Gobierno federal ha optado por abrir una investigación contra las autoridades del estado de Minnesota, a las que acusa de obstaculizar la labor de los agentes federales de inmigración.

El Patronato de Protección a la Mujer', analiza en una entrevista con elDiario.es una de las instituciones represivas menos conocidas del franquismo. Este organismo, creado en 1941 y gestionado en gran parte por congregaciones religiosas femeninas, se dedicó a internar a adolescentes y jóvenes mujeres consideradas 'inmorales' o 'en riesgo de caer', sin haber cometido delitos penales. Las causas de ingreso eran vagas y subjetivas: desde salir tarde de casa, tener amigos varones o mostrar interés por los hombres, hasta disidencias políticas en etapas posteriores. El Patronato sobrevivió al fin de la dictadura y continuó operativo hasta 1985, ya en democracia, con financiación estatal y métodos prácticamente idénticos: reclusión, trabajo forzado para empresas, adoctrinamiento religioso intenso, silencio impuesto, control de correspondencia y malas condiciones de vida con frío y hambre.

Los principales puntos cuestionados son el mecanismo de reequilibrio incluido en el pacto, que algunos eurodiputados consideran que podría limitar la autonomía regulatoria de la UE en materia ambiental y de estándares, y la base legal elegida para su aprobación, que permite ratificar los capítulos comerciales sin necesidad del visto bueno de todos los parlamentos nacionales.

Las primeras conclusiones técnicas descartan tanto el exceso de velocidad como el error humano y apuntan a una holgura mínima en la vía que habría ido aumentando con el paso del tiempo y el tránsito continuado de trenes de alta velocidad.

Según las hipótesis que manejan los investigadores, este defecto no habría sido una rotura súbita ni un fallo puntual, sino un problema localizado en un punto sensible de la vía, posiblemente en una soldadura o en el entorno de un cambio de agujas próximo a una estación técnica. Con el paso de numerosos convoyes, la combinación de peso, fricción y vibraciones habría agrandado progresivamente esa holgura hasta alcanzar un umbral crítico de apenas unos milímetros, suficiente para provocar que una rueda dejara de encajar co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-investigacion-del-accidente-de-adamuz-apunta-a-un-deterioro-progresivo-de-la-via-como-posible-causa-del-descarrilamiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-investigacion-del-accidente-de-adamuz-apunta-a-un-deterioro-progresivo-de-la-via-como-posible-causa-del-descarrilamiento</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Organizaciones vinculadas a Vox solicitan personarse como acusación popular tras el accidente ferroviario de Adamuz]]></title><description><![CDATA[La tragedia ferroviaria ocurrida en Adamuz (Córdoba), en la que han fallecido al menos 42 personas, ha entrado de lleno en el terreno político y judicial apenas dos días después del accidente.

Según este organismo, se trata de la tormenta geomagnética más potente registrada en los últimos 20 años, lo que explica su amplio impacto visual más allá de las regiones polares.

Las tormentas solares se producen cuando el Sol emite grandes cantidades de partículas cargadas, principalmente electrones y protones, que viajan por el espacio e interactúan con el campo magnético terrestre. Al llegar a la Tierra, la magnetosfera actúa como un escudo que canaliza estas partículas hacia las zonas cercanas a los polos. Allí, al chocar con los gases de la atmósfera en la exosfera, se genera la emisión de luz que conocemos como auroras boreales.

Inicialmente usaban un cartucho especial de 6 mm Velo-Dog, cargado con proyectiles de pimienta para ahuyentar o de plomo para mayor efectividad. Con el tiempo, ganaron popularidad como armas de defensa personal y se produjeron en calibres más comunes como 6,35 mm y 7,65 mm.

El coordinador de Seguridad Dinámica de Presidencia de la Generalitat ha cumplimentado la petición realizada el 11 de diciembre, y la diligencia ya se ha incorporado a la causa. Se trata de un avance clave para citar a declarar como testigos a estos policías y al chófer del vehículo oficial, medida acordada por la magistrada el 21 de noviembre. El objetivo es esclarecer si escucharon conversaciones mantenidas por Mazón con la exconsellera Salomé Pradas durante el trayecto al CECOPI, en relación con la gestión de la emergencia.

Basulto denuncia el creciente analfabetismo nutricional, que afecta tanto a la población general como a algunos profesionales de la salud, y critica a los 'cuñadietistas': influencers, famosos y personas que opinan sin base científica, contribuyendo a difundir información errónea. Además, subraya el papel de la industria alimentaria y los medios de comunicación en perpetuar mitos y mensajes confusos sobre alimentación.

La carta, titulada 'Es hora de ganar', advierte que la desigualdad económica amenaza la democracia y solicita políticas que reduzcan la influencia de los superricos en la política.

Honecker promovió también la paz internacional, el diálogo con Occidente y el apoyo a movimientos de liberación anticoloniales, manteniendo una alianza estrecha con la Unión Soviética.

Tradicionalmente, tipos más altos fortalecían la moneda al atraer capital, pero ahora los inversores interpretan estas subidas como señal de estrés fiscal en un país con deuda pública cercana al 230 % del PIB, penalizando el riesgo soberano en lugar de premiar la rentabilidad.

Este fenómeno se acelera con la política de la primera ministra Sanae Takaichi, quien asumió en octubre de 2025 y enfrenta elecciones anticipadas. Medidas como la posible rebaja de impuestos a los alimentos han provocado ventas masivas de deuda, con alzas bruscas en rendimientos a 20, 30 y 40 años.

La protesta derivó en enfrentamientos con la policía, que utilizó cañones de agua, gases irritantes y balas de goma tras recibir lanzamiento de piedras y petardos, aunque no se reportaron heridos. Además, activistas proyectaron una caricatura de Trump en una pista de esquí con la leyenda «Spirit of plutocracy».

El malestar se centra en las reiteradas amenazas de Trump de tomar el control de Groenlandia por motivos de seguridad nacional, sin descartar acciones militares, y sus advertencias de imponer aranceles a países que comercien con el territorio danés.

Técnicos de mantenimiento de Adif, desplazados horas después del suceso, detectaron varias traviesas de hormigón completamente destrozadas a unos 100 metros del punto de descarrilamiento, lo que sugiere el impacto fuerte de un elemento contundente desprendido del tren antes del accidente.

Aquella interfaz, con sus grandes bloques de colores y menú de inicio a pantalla completa, fue muy criticada y rechazada por los usuarios de ordenadores de escritorio tradicionales, ya que estaba pensada principalmente para dispositivos táctiles y móviles como tablets y teléfonos.

Anthony Scaramucci, exdirector de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca y fundador de SkyBridge Capital, señala que aunque las cifras nominales de dinero, propiedades o inversiones parezcan crecer con los años, el valor real puede disminuir significativamente. Scaramucci pone el ejemplo de la casa que sus padres compraron en 1962 por 16.000 dólares, lo que equivalía a 457 onzas de oro. Hoy, esa misma casa se valora en 750.000 dólares, pero en términos de oro, su valor se ha reducido a 227 onzas. De esta forma, aunque en papel se vea un aumento enorme, el poder adquisitivo real ha caído. También subraya que un millón de dólares actuales equivaldría aproximadamente a 122.819 dólares de 1970 según el cálculo del CPI de EE. UU., demostrando que el dólar ha perdido valor con el tiempo. La noticia recalca que este fenómeno afecta a todos, no solo a los ingresos fijos, y que muchas personas confunden números]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-inflacion-reduce-drasticamente-el-valor-real-del-dinero-un-millon-de-dolares-hoy-equivale-a-80-000-en-1970</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-inflacion-reduce-drasticamente-el-valor-real-del-dinero-un-millon-de-dolares-hoy-equivale-a-80-000-en-1970</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Policía Local investiga un caso de abandono y maltrato animal en El Ejido tras rescatar a un perro de un contenedor]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Local de El Ejido investiga a un hombre como presunto autor de un delito de abandono y maltrato animal tras arrojar a su perro a un contenedor de basura durante la madrugada. La actuación policial fue posible gracias a la colaboración ciudadana, después de que una mujer alertara al Centro de Coordinación Operativa Municipal (CECOv) al escuchar o detectar la presencia de un animal atrapado en el interior de un contenedor.

Los agentes de la patrulla de prevención 092 se desplazaron rápidamente al lugar y comprobaron que se trataba de un perro de pequeño tamaño que se encontraba en el interior del contenedor, en una situación de evidente riesgo para su vida. Tras rescatarlo, iniciaron las gestiones necesarias para identificar al animal y localizar a su propietario. Poco después, los policías localizaron al dueño, que en un primer momento aseguró que el perro se había extraviado de forma accidental.

La información, adelantada por el diario The Globe and Mail y confirmada por dos altos funcionarios del Gobierno canadiense, no constituye un plan militar operativo, sino una modelización conceptual que evalúa escenarios extremos derivados del deterioro político entre ambos países.

Según el análisis, las fuerzas armadas canadienses, con unos 100.000 efectivos entre personal activo y reservas, no podrían resistir más de una semana frente a la superioridad militar estadounidense. Ante ese escenario, la respuesta canadiense pasaría por adoptar tácticas de guerra de guerrillas, similares a las empleadas históricamente por los afganos frente a potencias militares muy superiores, basadas en emboscadas, sabotajes y acciones de pequeñas unidades paramilitares o civiles armados.

Lejos de la imagen habitual del estado asociada a las Montañas Rocosas, las estaciones de esquí y el imaginario del Lejano Oeste, esta región árida y aislada conserva una profunda herencia histórica y cultural vinculada a España y México. Durante siglos perteneció a la Corona española y, tras la independencia, pasó a manos de Estados Unidos con el Tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo, que teóricamente garantizaba el respeto al idioma, la religión y las propiedades de sus habitantes hispanos.

El aislamiento geográfico del valle ha permitido la conservación de tradiciones comunitarias, sistemas de gestión del agua basados en acequias y, de forma especialmente llamativa, una variedad arcaica del castellano conocida como español nuevo mexicano.

El partido estuvo marcado por una gran controversia arbitral: en el minuto 92 se anuló un gol a Senegal por una supuesta falta sobre Achraf Hakimi, y poco después el árbitro congoleño Jean-Jacques Ngambo Ndala señaló un penalti a favor de Marruecos por un leve contacto sobre Brahim Díaz, tras revisar el VAR. Esto provocó que el seleccionador senegalés ordenara a sus jugadores abandonar el campo durante más de veinte minutos en señal de protesta, con intentos de invasión del césped por parte de aficionados. Sadio Mané convenció a sus compañeros para regresar, y Brahim Díaz falló el penalti con un lanzamiento a lo Panenka que Édouard Mendy detuvo fácilmente.

Según los datos de la Corporación de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petrolíferos (CORES), el país ha pasado de no importar crudo estadounidense hasta 2016 a convertir a Estados Unidos en su primer proveedor de petróleo en la actualidad. Desde hace cuatro años, el crudo procedente de EEUU lidera el volumen de importaciones, con cifras que alcanzaron los 10,2 millones de toneladas en 2024 y 9,13 millones en 2025.

Este giro se explica por varios factores. En primer lugar, la liberalización de las exportaciones de crudo por parte de EEUU a partir de 2016 abrió la puerta a nuevos mercados como el español. Posteriormente, la pandemia no frenó esta tendencia y la guerra de Ucrania, junto al veto europeo al petróleo ruso y las restricciones al crudo venezolano, reforzaron aún más la apuesta por el suministro estadounidense.

Tras la suspensión del tráfico ferroviario en las líneas afectadas, se registraron subidas excepcionales en los precios de transportes alternativos, como coches de alquiler y vuelos. La nueva regulación, incluida en la versión de diciembre de 2025 del anteproyecto que se prepara para su aprobación en el Consejo de Ministros, obliga a las empresas que usan precios dinámicos a informar previamente del precio que mantendrán durante el periodo de venta, prohibiéndoles superarlo mientras el producto o servicio esté disponible.

Describe cómo una clienta de clase media-alta, acompañada de su madre, exige a una empleada bancaria realizar una operación no permitida por la normativa interna. Ante la negativa cortés de la trabajadora, la clienta reacciona con indignación no solo por el rechazo, sino por el hecho de que una persona situada más abajo en la jerarquía social se atreva a negarle algo.

Esta anécdota sirve para mostrar cómo las estructuras de clase se manifiestan en interacciones aparentemente banales. La clienta ha interiorizado que las reglas son flexibles cuando se cuenta con capital económico, cultural o simbólico, y percibe como natural su derecho a exigir excepciones. Por su parte, la empleada encarna la contradicción del trabajador en el capitalismo actua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-marxista-de-una-interaccion-de-clase-en-una-sucursal-bancaria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-marxista-de-una-interaccion-de-clase-en-una-sucursal-bancaria</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Estudio indica que la vacuna contra el herpes zóster podría ralentizar el envejecimiento biológico]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio realizado por la Escuela de Gerontología Leonard Davis de la Universidad del Sur de California sugiere que la vacuna contra el herpes zóster no solo previene la enfermedad, sino que podría influir positivamente en el envejecimiento biológico de los adultos mayores. Analizando datos de más de 3 800 participantes de 70 años o más, los investigadores observaron que aquellos vacunados presentaban niveles más bajos de inflamación crónica y perfiles genéticos más jóvenes en comparación con los no vacunados. Este efecto parece persistente incluso años después de la inmunización. La inflamación sistémica de bajo nivel, conocida como 'inflammaging', está asociada al desarrollo de enfermedades cardiovasculares, deterioro cognitivo y fragilidad, por lo que su reducción puede contribuir a un envejecimiento más saludable. En España, la vacuna recombinante frente al herpes zóster se incorporó de manera sistemática en 2021 para la cohorte de personas que cumplen 65 años, con captación prog]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estudio-indica-que-la-vacuna-contra-el-herpes-zoster-podria-ralentizar-el-envejecimiento-biologico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estudio-indica-que-la-vacuna-contra-el-herpes-zoster-podria-ralentizar-el-envejecimiento-biologico</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fuerte temporal en la Comunitat Valenciana provoca cierres de playas y paseos marítimos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Comunitat Valenciana se encuentra bajo alerta naranja debido a la borrasca Harry, que ha generado un fuerte temporal marítimo con olas que superan los seis metros de altura y rachas de viento de hasta 70 km/h. Este fenómeno ha causado graves daños en varias playas, obligando a los ayuntamientos a cerrar accesos, paseos marítimos y reforzar protecciones en zonas expuestas. Municipios como Sagunt, Cullera, Sueca, Tavernes de la Valldigna, Vinaròs, Almassora y Peñíscola han tomado medidas preventivas para evitar riesgos a la población, incluyendo la instalación de sacos de arena y muros de contención. La situación exige máxima precaución, ya que las olas pueden alcanzar hasta cinco metros en algunas localidades y el viento aumenta el riesgo en acantilados y espigones.

En kibbutzim como Givat Haim Ichud y Ein Hahoresh, agricultores describen cómo los pedidos se cancelan y la fruta queda sin vender, forzando la venta a mercados locales a precios más bajos o incluso a su desperdicio. Las dificultades logísticas en Asia, agravadas por el bloqueo de los hutíes en el Mar Rojo, aumentan los costes y retrasos, limitando las exportaciones a Rusia como último recurso.

Algunos usuarios bromean y muestran sorpresa al pensar que Little Saint James, más conocida como Epstein Island, formaba parte de la compra original de 1917. En realidad, en 1917 EE. UU. compró las Islas Vírgenes Danesas, que incluyen Saint Thomas, Saint John y Saint Croix, por 25 millones de dólares en oro. Little Saint James fue adquirida de manera privada por Jeffrey Epstein en 1998, mucho después de la cesión estadounidense. La isla se hizo tristemente famosa por los presuntos delitos sexuales de Epstein y por las investigaciones y demandas legales posteriores. Esta confusión ha generado memes y comentarios sobre la relación entre la compra histórica de tierras y la notoriedad de Epstein.

Este sistema de vacío, diseñado para mover residuos a través de cientos de kilómetros de tuberías hasta tanques de tratamiento, no soporta la carga de más de 4.000 tripulantes y se ve agravado por objetos inapropiados que se arrojan a los inodoros, así como por la complejidad añadida de los baños neutrales sin urinarios. Los fallos generan situaciones de insalubridad y obligan a reparaciones constantes que requieren costosos lavados con ácido, imposibles de realizar en alta mar, lo que limita la autonomía logística que caracteriza a este tipo de buques.

Europa posee entre ocho y doce billones de dólares en bonos del Tesoro, acciones y otros activos de EE.UU., representando cerca del 40% de la deuda pública estadounidense en manos extranjeras. Países como Bélgica, Luxemburgo, Francia e Irlanda destacan como grandes tenedores, junto al Reino Unido (fuera de la UE).

Este cambio se refleja en la bolsa: Adobe ha perdido un 32% de su valor en el último año, y las caídas son similares para otras plataformas SaaS como Salesforce. Aunque Adobe ha lanzado Firefly, su IA para generar imágenes, la tecnología aún no es competitiva frente a otras alternativas del mercado, mostrando problemas en la calidad y legibilidad de los textos generados. Las suscripciones mensuales de Adobe, antes una ventaja empresarial, ahora se perciben como un obstáculo frente a opciones más baratas o gratuitas.

En una entrevista concedida a la BBC, Broglio se refirió a escenarios como una hipotética ocupación de Groenlandia —territorio soberano de Dinamarca— o el uso de tropas contra inmigrantes dentro del propio país, iniciativas vinculadas a la agenda del presidente Donald Trump. El prelado subrayó que, aunque para un soldado resulte extremadamente difícil desobedecer una orden, hacerlo es moralmente legítimo si entra en conflicto con la conciencia individual.

La tensión ha aumentado debido a las amenazas del expresidente Donald Trump de imponer aranceles masivos a productos británicos en caso de que no se apoye su pretensión de incorporar Groenlandia a Estados Unidos. El exgeneral Shirreff, en un artículo para el Daily Mail, considera que Europa ha fallado al adoptar una política de apaciguamiento y que Estados Unidos se comporta como un actor hostil, calificándolo incluso de “depredador”. Esta situación podría desencadenar un conflicto en territorio groenlandés, lo que supondría el fin de la OTAN. Mientras el primer ministro británico, Sir Keir Starmer, aboga por una solución diplomática, las declaraciones de Shirreff han generado un debate político y estratégico en Europa sobre la posibilidad de un enfrentamiento directo entre aliados históricos.

El pasado 14 de enero, tras una discusión en la que la mujer le pidió que buscara otra vivienda, la joven presuntamente prendió fuego al sofá de la casa y salió a la calle con la excusa de tirar la basura, tardando mucho en regresar.

Los motivos son el mal estado de la vía, incluyendo baches detectados, problemas en un túnel y en aparatos de vía, lo que ha llevado a adoptar esta restricción por motivos de seguridad tras los reportes de varios maquinistas.

Encerradas tras murallas defensivas, las urbes no podían crecer hacia el exterior, lo que llevó a aprovechar cualquier espacio disponible. El puente ofrecía suelo ‘nuevo’, sin necesidad de ampliar murallas, y además permitía a los ayuntamientos recaudar rentas.

Estos puentes-calle eran el centro neurálgico del comercio, ya que todo el tránsito de personas y mercancías pasaba por ellos. Artesanos y mercaderes instalaban sus tiendas en la planta baja y vivían encima, beneficiándose en muchos casos de exenciones fiscales. Desde el punto de vista técnico, sostener edificios de varias plantas sobre pilares de piedra exigió soluciones ingeniosas, como voladizos de madera y sistemas de distribución de cargas propios del gótico.

Las comunidades locales, ante la escasa respuesta estatal, se organizaron en brigadas autoconvocadas con herramientas básicas para combatir las llamas, salvando casas y chacras en condiciones extremas agravadas por el cambio climático: reducción del 30-40 % de precipitaciones, inviernos con poca nieve y sequía prolongada, según informes del INTA. El artículo critica duramente las políticas del gobierno de Javier Milei, quien en mayo de 2025 eliminó la prohibición de cambiar el uso productivo de tierras incendiadas durante décadas y liberalizó la compra de terrenos rurales por extranjeros, creando condiciones que, según el autor, favorecen negocios inmobiliarios en áreas codiciadas por magnates como Luciano Benetto]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/incendios-intencionados-arrasan-14-000-hectareas-en-la-patagonia-argentina-tras-cambios-legislativos-de-milei-que-facilitan-la-explotacion-de-tierras-quemadas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/incendios-intencionados-arrasan-14-000-hectareas-en-la-patagonia-argentina-tras-cambios-legislativos-de-milei-que-facilitan-la-explotacion-de-tierras-quemadas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Demandas en EE.

Este cambio se produjo tras la invasión rusa de Ucrania en 2022 y la reducción drástica de las importaciones rusas (de 50% en 2021 a 12% actual), con un veto total al gas ruso en marcha. Sin embargo, el deterioro de las relaciones transatlánticas bajo la presidencia de Donald Trump genera alarma: amenazas de aranceles a países europeos (incluidos Francia, Alemania, Dinamarca y Reino Unido) para forzar la venta de Groenlandia (territorio danés) podrían poner en riesgo el suministro energético. Expertos y diplomáticos europeos advierten de una nueva vulnerabilidad geopolítica, ya que EE.UU. podría usar esta dependencia como herramienta de presión en política exterior.

El autor, Patrick Wintour, describe cómo Trump y su administración, representada por figuras como Marco Rubio y JD Vance, rechazan el orden liberal posguerra por considerarlo obsoleto y perjudicial para los intereses estadounidenses. Se critica la imprevisibilidad y el carácter personal de su diplomacia, que combina no intervencionismo con acciones coercitivas, extorsiones y desprecio explícito por el derecho internacional, limitando su poder solo a su 'propia moralidad'. Ejemplos incluyen la preferencia por acuerdos con Putin en detrimento de Ucrania, la intervención armada en Venezuela para deponer a Maduro, amenazas a Groenlandia, Canadá y México, y el apoyo tácito a acciones en Gaza que violan normas humanitarias.

La noticia recuerda este suceso en su 45º aniversario, destacando las tensiones internacionales que rodearon el gobierno de Whitlam.

Whitlam incomodaba tanto a Estados Unidos (durante la presidencia de Nixon y Ford) como al Reino Unido, principalmente por su intención de revisar el funcionamiento de la base militar conjunta Pine Gap, una instalación clave de inteligencia estadounidense en el desierto australiano utilizada para espionaje y seguimiento de misiles. Cartas desclasificadas revelan la intervención de la CIA y del MI6 británico en los acontecimientos previos al despido.

El suceso ocurrió en medio de intensas protestas contra las operaciones masivas de inmigración de ICE en Minnesota, que incluyen redadas y detenciones. El contexto se agrava por la muerte de Renée Nicole Good, una mujer de 37 años abatida a tiros por un agente de ICE a principios de enero de 2026 durante un incidente en su vehículo, lo que ha incrementado las tensiones y las acusaciones de uso excesivo de fuerza.

Macron subrayó que Europa dispone de mecanismos como la 'bazuca comercial' o el Mecanismo Anticoerción, y que debe utilizarlos para proteger sus empresas y mercados frente a la competencia desleal. En su discurso, destacó la importancia de la soberanía nacional y la independencia europea, así como de mantener un multilateralismo eficaz para evitar el proteccionismo y la inestabilidad global.

Aunque rechaza una comparación directa de personalidades entre Trump y Hitler, el autor examina el proceso histórico mediante el cual los nazis consolidaron el poder absoluto en Alemania en 1933: tras unas elecciones controvertidas, obtuvieron una mayoría parlamentaria que aprobó la ley habilitante (Ermächtigungsgesetz), entregando todos los poderes legislativos al Gobierno y eliminando la separación de poderes, para después prohibir el resto de partidos.

El texto advierte de paralelismos en las declaraciones de Trump, quien ha afirmado que su poder como comandante en jefe solo está limitado por su conciencia, y menciona eventos recientes como el secuestro del dictador venezolano Nicolás Maduro por parte de EE UU, visto como una violación flagrante del Derecho internacional que podría servir para desviar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-historico-como-se-podria-llegar-a-un-cambio-autoritario-en-ee-uu-segun-el-ejemplo-nazi</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-historico-como-se-podria-llegar-a-un-cambio-autoritario-en-ee-uu-segun-el-ejemplo-nazi</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lecciones pendientes tras el accidente de Angrois: atención y justicia para las víctimas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El accidente del tren Alvia en Angrois, Santiago de Compostela, ocurrido el 24 de julio de 2013, causó la muerte de 80 personas y heridas a 145. Los afectados y sus familias sufrieron durante años la desatención, mentiras y retrasos por parte de las administraciones, teniendo que esperar más de once años para una sentencia judicial. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) determinó inicialmente que la causa del siniestro fue exceso de velocidad y un despiste del maquinista, sin considerar los fallos en la infraestructura denunciados por las víctimas. Gracias a la intervención de la eurodiputada Ana Miranda y la Comisión Europea, se cuestionó la independencia de la investigación y se impulsaron mejoras en la normativa de seguridad ferroviaria. A pesar de ello, las víctimas enfrentaron un proceso judicial largo y complejo, con irregularidades denunciadas como ocultación de documentos y condicionamiento de testigos a favor de Adif.

En la primera votación no logró la mayoría absoluta necesaria, pero finalmente salió adelante gracias a los 29 escaños del grupo popular. El resto de formaciones votaron a sus propios candidatos: PSOE, Vox y Unidas por Extremadura, evidenciando la falta de acuerdos entre los bloques parlamentarios.

La elección de Naharro se produce en un contexto de fuerte controversia política y mediática debido a informaciones publicadas en meses anteriores sobre mensajes privados que habría enviado a un exmilitante del PP. En dichos mensajes, según la información contrastada judicialmente, el dirigente popular ofrecía un puesto de chófer con un salario de 1.800 euros mensuales en 14 pagas, acompañado de insinuaciones sexuales explícitas.

El presupuesto total de la obra asciende a más de 858 millones de euros, a los que se aplicaría un tipo del 4% en concepto de ICIO. Sin embargo, la normativa municipal permite bonificaciones de hasta el 50% por fomento del empleo, lo que reduciría drásticamente la recaudación prevista.

El tren Iryo, compuesto por ocho coches, sufrió el descarrilamiento de sus tres últimos vagones cuando circulaba por la línea de alta velocidad Madrid-Andalucía.

La defensa argumenta que existe una jurisprudencia pacífica consolidada en España que impide exigir a un investigado la aportación de documentación probatoria en su contra, pues ello vulneraría su derecho constitucional a no declarar contra sí mismo y a guardar silencio.

Estos trenes podrán circular a velocidades de hasta 350 km/h en la red española, lo que permitiría reducir el tiempo de viaje entre Madrid y Barcelona a menos de dos horas, mejorando así la eficiencia operativa y la experiencia de los pasajeros en los corredores más demandados. El contrato adjudicado incluirá no solo la compra, sino también el mantenimiento integral de las unidades durante un periodo de 15 años, siendo el plazo de entrega un criterio clave en la puntuación de las ofertas. La financiación se cubrirá con recursos propios de la empresa, préstamos procedentes de fondos europeos y posibles ayudas del Pacto Verde Europeo.

La Fiscalía atribuyó a los acusados la liberación de casi 21.000 toneladas de CO₂ durante cinco años, lo que equivale a aproximadamente 30.200 vuelos entre Madrid y Nueva York o a las emisiones anuales de 3.750 españoles. Esta es una de las pocas condenas penales que se han dictado en España por emisiones de este tipo desde desguaces, aunque la sentencia ha sido recurrida. Los investigadores de la Guardia Civil y de la Comunidad de Madrid detectaron que los coches no habían sido descontaminados correctamente, a pesar de tener certificados de destrucción.

Según Ismael Rodrigo, presidente de la Federación Española de Naturismo, los jóvenes muestran interés por el cuerpo natural, pero evitan implicarse en el activismo y la gestión de asociaciones debido a la moral puritana impuesta por las redes sociales. Estas plataformas censuran la desnudez no sexual (como pezones femeninos) y promueven cuerpos perfectos e irreales mediante filtros y algoritmos, lo que desplaza la aceptación social del desnudo natural.

Expertos como el psicólogo Roberto Sanz señalan que la ausencia de educación sexual adecuada asocia la desnudez solo al sexo o a la pornografía, aumentando la presión estética sobre cuerpos reales, especialmente en hombres por la influencia de la 'machosfera'. Los vestuarios o gimnasios, donde antes había desnudez casual, se han convertido en espacios de comparación y juicio.

La motivación real detrás de este impulso no es ideológica, ya que Groenlandia no representa un enemigo político; el interés principal es económico: las empresas estadounidenses buscan explotar los recursos minerales del territorio y algunos multimillonarios consideran a Groenlandia como un espacio de inversión desregulado.

El objetivo principal es reducir las quejas vecinales por suciedad en las calles y alrededor de los contenedores, un problema cada vez más frecuente a pesar del aumento del presupuesto en limpieza.

Entre las novedades destacan varias prohibiciones explícitas. Se prohíbe depositar o abandonar residuos domiciliarios fuera de los contenedores adecuados o en lugares no autorizados, con multas de hasta 3.000 €.

De ese total, 951 procedimientos terminaron con resultado de muerte, 153 más que el año anterior, lo que refleja un agravamiento de las consecuencias en los casos denunciados.

Las causas más habituales de las reclamaciones están relacionadas con la mala praxis médica, incluyendo intervenciones quirúrgicas mal realizadas, altas hospitalarias precipitadas, atención sanitaria deficiente, infecciones hospitalarias y retrasos en la asistencia de ambulancias.

Según el informe, los exportadores extranjeros no redujeron significativamente sus precios ante las subidas arancelarias, lo que resulta en un traslado casi completo del 96% del coste a los compradores estadounidenses, mientras que solo el 4% recae en las empresas extranjeras.

El análisis destaca que el aumento de 200.000 millones de dólares en la recaudación aduanera equivale a una extracción similar de recursos de hogares y empresas de EE.UU., funcionando los aranceles más como un impuesto al consumo interno que como una carga para los productores extranjeros.

Senegal se proclamó campeón al vencer por 1-0 con un gol en la prórroga de Pape Gueye (jugador del Villarreal), después de un desenlace caótico en el tiempo reglamentario. En el minuto 97, el árbitro señaló un penalti polémico a favor de Marruecos por una falta sobre Brahim Díaz, lo que provocó que los jugadores senegaleses abandonaran temporalmente el terreno de juego por orden de su entrenador, Pape Thiaw, en señal de protesta. El partido estuvo interrumpido más de diez minutos, con intentos de invasión del césped por parte de aficionados senegaleses.

Sin embargo, fuentes ministeriales han precisado que todavía no se ha establecido una relación causal clara, es decir, si esa rotura fue la causa del descarrilamiento o una consecuencia del mismo. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) se encuentra en fase inicial de recopilación de datos, inspecciones en el lugar y extracción de registradores de ambos trenes (un Iryo Málaga-Madrid y un Alvia Madrid-Huelva).

Los restos, localizados bajo la Plaza Andrea Costa y alrededores durante excavaciones financiadas por el PNRR, incluyen muros de hasta dos metros de altura, suelos de mármol verde y columnas monumentales cuyo diámetro (1,47 metros, equivalente a cinco pies romanos) coincide exactamente con las descripciones detalladas por Vitruvio.

En 1959 regresó a Italia y fundó su propio taller, contando con el apoyo económico de su padre y de Giancarlo Giammetti, quien fue también su pareja durante muchos años.

Este sello era obligatorio para la distribución masiva, lo que provocó el cierre de numerosas editoriales y la salida de cientos de profesionales.

A finales de los años 60 y principios de los 70, el código empezó a quedar obsoleto. Marvel, con Stan Lee a la cabeza, ya había desafiado sus normas con historias sobre drogas sin sello. En febrero de 1971 se revisó el código, permitiendo criaturas de terror siempre que se trataran en la tradición clásica literaria (como Drácula o Frankenstein).

Aprovechando esta relajación, Roy Thomas y Gil Kane crearon a Morbius, el vampiro viviente, que debutó en The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (otoño de 1971).

La disputa se intensificó durante el fin de semana, cuando Trump anunció la imposición de aranceles del 10 % a partir del 1 de febrero —que podrían elevarse hasta el 25 % en junio— a productos procedentes de ocho países aliados, entre ellos varios europeos.

El informe subraya que en solo un año los multimillonarios aumentaron su riqueza en 2,5 billones de dólares, una cifra prácticamente equivalente a la riqueza total de la mitad más pobre de la humanidad.

El texto de la misiva, difundido oficialmente por el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca, destaca por su tono infantil, errores históricos y una visión distorsionada de la realidad internacional.

Applebaum subraya que Trump afirma falsamente haber detenido ocho guerras, desconoce la soberanía histórica y jurídicamente documentada de Dinamarca sobre Groenlandia —reconocida incluso por Estados Unidos— y se atribuye méritos inexistentes dentro de la OTAN. La autora insiste en que lo relevante no es solo la inexactitud de los argumentos, sino el mensaje de fondo: un presidente que parece operar en una realidad paralela, ajeno a las nor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-carta-de-trump-a-noruega-reabre-el-debate-sobre-los-limites-institucionales-en-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-carta-de-trump-a-noruega-reabre-el-debate-sobre-los-limites-institucionales-en-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El grupo ultraderechista Betar cesa su actividad en Nueva York tras un acuerdo con la fiscalía por acoso y violencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El grupo proisraelí de extrema derecha Betar US pondrá fin a sus operaciones en el estado de Nueva York tras un acuerdo alcanzado con la fiscal general del estado, Letitia James, como resultado de una investigación oficial por conductas violentas, amenazas y acoso motivados por prejuicios. La investigación concluyó que la organización llevó a cabo ataques, intimidaciones y campañas de hostigamiento dirigidas contra personas musulmanas, árabes, palestinas y también judías, vulnerando las leyes de derechos civiles de Nueva York.

El acuerdo obliga a Betar a cesar de inmediato cualquier incitación a la violencia, las amenazas contra manifestantes y el acoso a personas que ejercen sus derechos civiles. Además, establece una sanción económica de 50.000 dólares que queda suspendida, pero que se aplicará si la organización incumple los términos pactados.

Según los hechos acreditados, el agente se acercó con actitud agresiva, elevando la voz, y llegó a gritar a la empleada de la aerolínea frases como «¿quién cojones eres tú para pedirme datos médicos?

Aunque la hipótesis vasco-iberista fue descartada en gran medida durante el siglo XX tras el desciframiento del alfabeto ibérico, recientes análisis internos de inscripciones han revitalizado un enfoque moderado.

El trabajo destaca el sistema numeral ibérico, prácticamente idéntico al vasco (vigésimo, con formas como ban/bat para 'uno', bi para 'dos', laur/lau para 'cuatro', etc.), lo que sugiere un origen común o contacto estrecho. Orduña extiende el análisis a nombres de parentesco y denominaciones personales, identificando elementos recurrentes en contextos no onomásticos típicos (como aur, uni(n), aste, be(i), -kidei), que presentan paralelos con términos vascos o aquitanos: aita (padre), seme (hijo), unide (nodriza), -(k)ide (compañero), etc.

El jugador escribió bajo los ojos, en la franja negra que se utiliza habitualmente para reducir el brillo, el mensaje “Stop the genocide” (“Detened el genocidio”), en referencia a la situación en Gaza. Según la liga, esta acción vulnera el reglamento interno, que prohíbe expresamente la exhibición de mensajes personales, políticos o sociales en el equipamiento o la indumentaria durante los días de partido.

Al-Shaair mostró el mensaje por primera vez en el encuentro de la ronda de Wild Card frente a los Pittsburgh Steelers, partido que los Texans ganaron. Posteriormente, apareció con el mismo mensaje en una entrevista televisiva en ESPN, lo que amplificó su impacto mediático.

Las Fuerzas Armadas danesas han confirmado el inicio de prácticas de tiro y entrenamiento de combate en condiciones extremas de frío, viento y nieve. Este refuerzo se produce tras amenazas reiteradas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump sobre la posible adquisición o control de la isla por motivos de seguridad nacional, lo que ha elevado las tensiones en el Ártico.

Algunos soldados de países aliados, como Alemania, que llegaron en contingentes previos de reconocimiento, ya han regresado, aunque se esperan nuevos envíos.

Comenzó su carrera cinematográfica en 1954 con Columbia Pictures y rápidamente destacó en películas como 'Picnic' (1955), 'The Man with the Golden Arm' (1955) y 'Pal Joey' (1957). Su fama se consolidó con 'Vértigo' (1958) de Alfred Hitchcock, considerada hoy una de las mejores películas de la historia. Antes de ser descubierta, trabajó como modelo promocional y fue conocida públicamente como 'Miss Deepfreeze'. A lo largo de su carrera, Novak se mostró determinada a mantener su identidad, evitando los estereotipos impuestos por los estudios, lo que llevó a la creación del nombre artístico Kim Novak. A pesar de su éxito en taquilla, Novak se retiró mayormente de la actuación en 1966, dedicándose a la pintura, los caballos y una vida más tranquila en Big Sur y Oregon.

El impacto fue devastador, provocando que varios vagones salieran despedidos y cayeran por un talud cercano.

Entre las víctimas mortales confirmadas por la Guardia Civil se encuentran el periodista onubense Óscar Toro y la fotoperiodista María Clauss, un matrimonio muy conocido en el ámbito cultural y comunicativo de Huelva. Toro, doctor cum laude en Comunicación por la Universidad de Huelva, era director de la Fundación Xul, impulsor de la editorial Voces del Sur y un referent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-de-periodistas-oscar-toro-y-maria-clauss-entre-las-39-victimas-mortales-del-accidente-ferroviario-de-adamuz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-de-periodistas-oscar-toro-y-maria-clauss-entre-las-39-victimas-mortales-del-accidente-ferroviario-de-adamuz</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adif mantuvo los 250 km/h en el tramo de Adamuz pese a las advertencias sindicales y los incidentes previos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El grave accidente ferroviario ocurrido en el tramo de alta velocidad entre Adamuz y Villanueva de Córdoba, con un balance provisional de 39 fallecidos y alrededor de 150 heridos, ha puesto el foco en las decisiones previas de Adif sobre la seguridad de la infraestructura. Meses antes del siniestro, el sindicato de maquinistas SEMAF había solicitado una reducción de la velocidad máxima, fijada en 250 km/h, en varios tramos de la línea Madrid-Sevilla, incluido el punto exacto donde se produjo el descarrilamiento y posterior colisión.

Los maquinistas alertaban de una 'degradación profunda y acelerada' tanto de los trenes como de la infraestructura, mencionando baches, garrotes, descompensaciones en la catenaria y averías frecuentes, especialmente agravadas por las altas temperaturas y las vibraciones del tráfico ferroviario. Estas advertencias se apoyaban en hechos concretos: en junio de 2025 se registraron dos incidencias en ese mismo tramo relacionadas con dilataciones de la vía y fal]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adif-mantuvo-los-250-km-h-en-el-tramo-de-adamuz-pese-a-las-advertencias-sindicales-y-los-incidentes-previos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adif-mantuvo-los-250-km-h-en-el-tramo-de-adamuz-pese-a-las-advertencias-sindicales-y-los-incidentes-previos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China desarrolla un método limpio para reciclar litio de baterías usadas y capturar CO₂]]></title><description><![CDATA[Investigadores de la Academia China de Ciencias y del Instituto de Tecnología de Pekín han desarrollado un proceso innovador para reciclar baterías de litio usando únicamente dióxido de carbono y agua, sin necesidad de químicos agresivos ni calor. Este método permite recuperar hasta el 95% del litio presente en las baterías, a niveles comparables con los procesos industriales tradicionales, pero con un impacto ambiental mucho menor. Además del litio, los metales del cátodo como cobalto, níquel y manganeso se transforman en catalizadores reutilizables, aportando valor añadido. El proceso también captura parte del CO₂, inmovilizándolo en subproductos sólidos, contribuyendo así al secuestro de carbono. Su principal ventaja es que se realiza a temperatura y presión ambiente, reduciendo riesgos laborales, consumo energético y generación de residuos peligrosos. Este enfoque ofrece una solución para la creciente gestión de residuos de baterías en China y podría facilitar el cumplimiento de re]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-desarrolla-un-metodo-limpio-para-reciclar-litio-de-baterias-usadas-y-capturar-co</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-desarrolla-un-metodo-limpio-para-reciclar-litio-de-baterias-usadas-y-capturar-co</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comparación del riesgo soberano entre economías desarrolladas y emergentes a partir de sus indicadores macroeconómicos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo plantea un ejercicio comparativo para reflexionar sobre el concepto de riesgo país desde una perspectiva puramente cuantitativa, alejándose de prejuicios habituales asociados al desarrollo económico o al peso geopolítico de los Estados. El autor propone imaginar una inversión en bonos soberanos emitidos por distintos países, eliminando variables como el riesgo de divisa o las diferencias de cupón, para centrarse exclusivamente en indicadores macroeconómicos clave. 

Se analizan cinco Estados anónimos, identificados como A, B, C, D y E, a partir de cuatro variables fundamentales: deuda pública en relación con el PIB, déficit público, balanza por cuenta corriente y crecimiento del PIB. El objetivo es que el lector valore cuál de ellos presenta un mayor riesgo de impago y cuáles ofrecen, sobre el papel, una situación fiscal y macroeconómica más sólida.

Tras exponer los datos, el autor desvela la identidad de los países: India, Francia, Indonesia, Estados Unidos y Uzbekistán. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/comparacion-del-riesgo-soberano-entre-economias-desarrolladas-y-emergentes-a-partir-de-sus-indicadores-macroeconomicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/comparacion-del-riesgo-soberano-entre-economias-desarrolladas-y-emergentes-a-partir-de-sus-indicadores-macroeconomicos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump presiona a Noruega por el Nobel de la Paz y reitera su intención de controlar Groenlandia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Donald Trump volvió a situarse en el centro de la polémica internacional tras enviar una carta al primer ministro de Noruega en la que expresó su malestar por no haber recibido el Premio Nobel de la Paz. En el texto, el presidente de Estados Unidos afirmó explícitamente que no siente “la obligación de pensar únicamente en la paz”, vinculando de forma directa su actuación internacional al reconocimiento que, a su juicio, merece. El mensaje ha sido interpretado como una forma de presión política hacia el país que alberga el comité encargado de conceder el galardón.

La misiva no se limita a una queja personal. Trump aprovechó la ocasión para insistir en una de sus posiciones más controvertidas en política exterior: la pretensión de ejercer un “control pleno y absoluto” sobre Groenlandia.

El partido ya venía cargado de tensión por las decisiones arbitrales, especialmente un penalti señalado a favor de Marruecos en el tiempo añadido antes de la prórroga, que Brahim no consiguió transformar. Esta acción provocó una fuerte protesta del combinado senegalés, que llegó a amenazar con abandonar el terreno de juego como muestra de desacuerdo.

Más allá de la polémica arbitral, una de las imágenes más comentadas fue el comportamiento de varios recogepelotas marroquíes y miembros de la organización, que intentaron retirar de forma reiterada la toalla del portero titular de Senegal, Édouard Mendy, situada detrás de la portería.

Mientras los equipos de emergencia trabajaban sobre el terreno y aún se confirmaban víctimas mortales, Quiles difundió un tuit criticando la suspensión de la circulación ferroviaria entre Madrid y Andalucía, calificando la situación como propia del “tercer mundo”.

En una entrevista recuperada de 2022 por El Español, Cintora describió cómo su familia vivía sin agua caliente, calefacción, lavadora, frigorífico ni ducha, y su madre calentaba agua en latas o en el fogón para bañar a los hijos en la misma pila donde fregaba los utensilios.

Ante los comentarios que cuestionaban la coherencia de su relato al haber accedido a estudios universitarios privados, el periodista publicó un mensaje en X el 17 de enero de 2026, en el que, por petición de su madre Mariluz, confirmó esos detalles de precariedad entre 1977 y 1986.

La magistrada Montserrat Fernández Cabezas considera que estos mensajes estigmatizaban al colectivo trans y a las personas intersexuales o no binarias, atentando contra su dignidad y constituyendo expresiones discriminatorias por motivos de sexo, género y orientación sexual.

Documentos internos de compañías como Exxon, Total, Shell, General Motors y Ford muestran que desde la década de 1950 hasta los años 1980 sus propios expertos confirmaban el calentamiento global derivado de la quema de combustibles fósiles, en contra del discurso público negacionista que estas empresas promovían a través de campañas mediáticas, pagos a científicos afines y desinformación generalizada. Esta práctica deliberada de ocultación y manipulación ha llevado a que actualmente existan múltiples demandas legales de gobiernos y organizaciones ambientales, aunque el proceso judicial se ve ralentizado por estrategias dilatorias aprendidas de la industria del tabaco.

Este edificio del siglo XII, catalogado como Bien de Interés Cultural, había mostrado signos de deterioro durante años, pero las autoridades eclesiásticas negaban indicios de peligro. Expertos señalan que la despoblación, la falta de mantenimiento y factores ambientales, como filtraciones y pequeños movimientos sísmicos recientes, han contribuido al colapso. La situación refleja un problema recurrente en Castilla y León, donde múltiples monumentos y construcciones históricas sufren deterioro por la dejadez institucional. Vecinos e historiadores del arte del pueblo habían observado el desgaste durante años y lamentan que las promesas de inversión en conservación, como la del presidente autonómico Alfonso Fernández Mañueco de dedicar un 1% del presupuesto a patrimonio, no se hayan]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derrumbe-del-abside-mudejar-de-muriel-pone-en-evidencia-la-falta-de-conservacion-del-patrimonio-en-castilla-y-leon</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derrumbe-del-abside-mudejar-de-muriel-pone-en-evidencia-la-falta-de-conservacion-del-patrimonio-en-castilla-y-leon</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Funcionarios de la FIFA expresan vergüenza interna por el premio de la paz otorgado a Donald Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[Existe una creciente sensación de vergüenza entre funcionarios de nivel medio y alto dentro de la FIFA tras la entrega del premio de la paz al presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump. El galardón, el primero de su categoría, fue otorgado por el presidente de la FIFA, Gianni Infantino, durante el sorteo del Mundial en Washington DC en diciembre de 2025. Infantino alabó a Trump destacando su papel como líder que representa 'esperanza, unidad y futuro'. Sin embargo, tras el premio, Estados Unidos ha llevado a cabo bombardeos en Venezuela, capturado y encarcelado al presidente Nicolás Maduro y a su esposa por cargos relacionados con narcoterrorismo, y Trump ha amenazado con invadir Groenlandia alegando necesidades estratégicas del país. Estas acciones han generado un profundo malestar interno en la organización, pasando de una inquietud inicial por la falta de transparencia en el proceso de selección a una 'vergüenza profunda', según fuentes internas.

Para 2026, eleva la estimación en 0,3 puntos hasta el 2,3 %, y para 2027 en 0,2 puntos hasta el 1,9 %. Estas son las mayores revisiones al alza entre las economías avanzadas. España se consolida como la locomotora del crecimiento en Europa, superando claramente a Alemania, Francia e Italia, y solo por detrás de Estados Unidos (2,4 % en 2026 y 2 % en 2027). El buen desempeño se explica por el fuerte aumento de la fuerza laboral gracias a la inmigración, los fondos europeos Next Generation y el dinamismo del sector servicios. Además, el efecto arrastre del sólido cierre de 2025 impulsa el crecimiento de 2026 en aproximadamente un punto porcentual. El FMI destaca que España encadenará siete años consecutivos creciendo por encima del 2 %, lo que permite reducir el déficit público (hasta el 2,2 % en 2026) y acercar la deuda por debajo del 100 % del PIB, i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fmi-revisa-al-alza-las-previsiones-de-crecimiento-de-espana-para-2026-y-2027-superando-a-las-principales-economias-europeas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fmi-revisa-al-alza-las-previsiones-de-crecimiento-de-espana-para-2026-y-2027-superando-a-las-principales-economias-europeas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE. UU. propone a Putin participar en la supervisión de la reconstrucción de Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El gobierno de Estados Unidos ha invitado al presidente ruso, Vladímir Putin, a formar parte de la Junta de la Paz destinada a supervisar la reconstrucción de la Franja de Gaza tras el conflicto entre Israel y Hamás.

Según el borrador del estatuto de la junta, su objetivo será restablecer una gobernanza sólida en Gaza, aunque la organización estará bajo la autoridad principal de Trump, quien podrá invitar o expulsar miembros y establecer límites temporales de participación, condicionados a contribuciones económicas.

En él denuncia un supuesto 'maltrato' hacia su delegación, destacando principalmente la falta de medidas de seguridad adecuadas durante el viaje en tren desde Tánger a Rabat, lo que provocó situaciones de hacinamiento y riesgos para jugadores y cuerpo técnico. Además, rechazan de forma categórica realizar el entrenamiento oficial en el Complejo Mohammed VI (sede habitual de la selección marroquí), argumentando que ello vulnera la equidad deportiva, y aún no habían recibido información alternativa sobre el lugar de entrenamiento.

Estas amenazas consisten en la imposición de aranceles del 10 % a partir del 1 de febrero de 2026 sobre productos de ocho países europeos que han enviado tropas a Groenlandia en el marco de misiones de reconocimiento de la OTAN, con una subida al 25 % en junio si no se llega a un acuerdo para la compra total de la isla por parte de Estados Unidos.

Prévot, en una entrevista en el medio belga VRT NWS, calificó la situación de paradójica, ya que Estados Unidos había pedido mayor atención a la seguridad en el Ártico, y la respuesta de varios aliados de la OTAN fue enviar soldados para misiones de reconocimiento. Sin embargo, Washington lo ha interpretado como una acción antiestadounidense, algo que el ministro belga considera falso.

Fernández Heredia ha subrayado que no era un caso de exceso de velocidad, pues el tramo es una recta, y que la vía había sido renovada en mayo, por lo que debería encontrarse en óptimas condiciones.

El principal argumento de la defensa, liderada por el penalista José Antonio Choclán, es la ausencia de jurisdicción de los tribunales españoles para conocer del caso, ya que los hechos se produjeron en el extranjero y, según su interpretación, el artículo 23.2 de la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial solo aplica de forma subsidiaria cuando el Estado local no puede ejercer su jurisdicción.

Según Manera, el origen de esta crisis no es accidental ni coyuntural, sino el resultado de décadas de aplicación de la nueva ortodoxia neoliberal, caracterizada por dar primacía al mercado, reducir el papel del Estado, liberalizar los movimientos de capital y privatizar empresas públicas. Este modelo ha favorecido una fuerte concentración empresarial y una restricción de la competencia, debilitando las bases productivas de muchas economías.

El texto sitúa el análisis en una perspectiva histórica amplia, dividiendo el último siglo en tres grandes etapas: de 1913 a 1950, de 1950 a 1973 y de 1973 a 2008.

Dos trenes de alta velocidad descarrilaron a las 19:45 horas, provocando la muerte de al menos 39 personas y dejando más de 150 heridos de diversa consideración. El suceso se produjo cuando un tren AV Iryo procedente de Málaga descarriló en los desvíos de entrada a la estación e invadió la vía contigua, por la que circulaba un tren Alvia con destino Huelva desde Madrid Puerta de Atocha. Como consecuencia del impacto, ambos convoyes descarrilaron.

La peor parte del choque la sufrieron los dos primeros vagones del tren Alvia, que cayeron por un terraplén de unos cuatro metros. En esas unidades viajaban 53 pasajeros de los aproximadamente 200 que iban a bordo. Los servicios de emergencia desplegaron un amplio operativo en la zona, instalando un hospital de campaña en el que se atendió a unos 170 heridos leves, mientras q]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/choque-y-descarrilamiento-de-dos-trenes-de-alta-velocidad-en-adamuz-deja-al-menos-39-fallecidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/choque-y-descarrilamiento-de-dos-trenes-de-alta-velocidad-en-adamuz-deja-al-menos-39-fallecidos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Osprey V, la banda de rock de Gaza, depende de la embajada española para participar en el concierto solidario por Palestina en Barcelona]]></title><description><![CDATA[La banda palestina Osprey V, considerada la primera banda de rock surgida en la Franja de Gaza, se encuentra a la espera de que la embajada de España active el artículo 38 de la Ley 12/2009 sobre asilo y protección subsidiaria. Este mecanismo permitiría su traslado seguro a territorio español para solicitar protección internacional y, de esta forma, poder actuar en el Concierto-Manifiesto x Palestina, que tendrá lugar el 29 de enero de 2026 en el Palau Sant Jordi de Barcelona.

El evento, organizado por la plataforma Act x Palestine, reúne a numerosos artistas de renombre como Oques Grasses, Amaia, Fermín Muguruza, Bad Gyal, Morad y otros, con el objetivo de visibilizar la grave situación humanitaria en Gaza, denunciar el conflicto y defender la cultura como forma de resistencia y memoria. La participación de Osprey V tiene un fuerte valor simbólico, ya que su música refleja la experiencia de vida bajo ocupación y bloqueo.

En una carta dirigida al Primer Ministro noruego, Trump ha justificado su postura argumentando que, al no recibir el galardón, ya no se siente obligado a mantener una política basada en la paz. Esta declaración viene acompañada de una reevaluación de la propiedad de Groenlandia, cuestionando la titularidad danesa y acusando a Dinamarca de no haber abordado las amenazas rusas en la isla. Trump también ha vinculado su frustración con expectativas para la OTAN, exigiendo más compromiso por parte de la alianza. La Unión Europea está considerando medidas económicas para contrarrestar la presión política ejercida por Trump, quien ha intensificado sus acusaciones a través de la plataforma Truth Social. A pesar de un gesto simbólico de la opositora venezolana María Machado, entregándole una réplica del Nobel, Trump parece ignorar la oferta.

A pesar de ello, desde el segundo día de baja comenzó a realizar intensas rutas de bicicleta de montaña, registradas en su perfil público de una aplicación tipo Strava, sumando más de 374 km y 5.432 metros de desnivel en varias salidas, algunas de hasta 75 km y 1.330 m de desnivel. Durante este periodo, la lesión empeoró inicialmente según las revisiones médicas, aunque posteriormente mejoró tras un ingreso hospitalario por síntomas cardíacos (descartados).

Durante homilías y comunicados, ha criticado al Gobierno español por su agenda social y cultural, atacando desde la Agenda 2030 hasta la Ley de Memoria Democrática, y cuestionando medidas como la resignificación del Valle de los Caídos o la reparación de víctimas de pederastia clerical. Sanz ha usado expresiones controvertidas para referirse a ecolojetas, al genocidio de Gaza y a figuras políticas, lo que le ha llevado a tensiones con autoridades regionales y con algunos miembros del episcopado. Su sintonía con Vox y la defensa de símbolos históricos como Covadonga refuerzan su imagen de líder religioso con un enfoque político marcado.

Esta fortuna conjunta supera la riqueza total poseída por cerca de 18,7 millones de personas, es decir, casi el 40% de la población española. De media, cada uno de estos 33 superricos ganó más de 77 millones de euros diarios durante 2025. El informe destaca que esta extrema concentración de riqueza no solo representa una brecha económica, sino también un aumento del poder político de estas élites, que tienen 4.000 veces más probabilidades de ocupar cargos políticos que la población media.

A pesar de contar con más de 800 millones de usuarios activos semanales, el 95% utiliza el servicio de manera gratuita, lo que limita los ingresos por suscripciones y dificulta cubrir las enormes inversiones. Se estima que OpenAI podría quedarse sin dinero a mediados de 2027 si continúa con el ritmo actual de gasto, que incluye inversiones masivas en hardware, como los 1,4 billones de dólares destinados a TPU para centros de datos. La situación refleja un desequilibrio entre el 'hype' de la IA y la rentabilidad real del sector, donde muchas empresas invierten grandes sumas esperando beneficios que todavía no se materializan.

Esta decisión se debe a que la ciudad no contaba con pisos ni albergues disponibles para activar 15 plazas de alojamiento temporal y 10 de urgencia. La devolución de fondos se produce después del desalojo del instituto B9, donde unas 400 personas fueron expulsadas y medio centenar sigue durmiendo en la calle. El consistorio sostiene que la falta de recursos es un problema histórico y que ningún gobierno previo ha garantizado servicios de acogida suficientes.

La serie explora la supervivencia y la individualidad en un entorno global unificado, planteando preguntas sobre la humanidad y la libertad, aunque lo hace con un tono ligero y pausado que evita la densidad excesiva de otras obras del género. 'Pluribus' se sostiene casi exclusivamente sobre la actuación de Seehorn, que da vida a un personaje complejo capaz de mantener la atención en cada escena.
