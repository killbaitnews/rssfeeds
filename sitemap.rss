The collaboration is seen as a way to bypass Western-controlled trade routes, offering India an alternative for accessing European markets. Meanwhile, China has also explored alternatives to the Suez Canal, such as improving trade relations in the Middle East and establishing new corridors for energy and goods transport. A major focus is the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which seeks to connect India, Iran, and Russia via a combination of rail, road, and sea routes. Despite various setbacks—including regional instability and bureaucratic delays—the INSTC represents a potential shift in global trade patterns, with Russia emerging as a key player bridging Asia and Europe. This development highlights Russia's growing influence, as it could become the backbone of Euro-Asian ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-turns-to-russia-reducing-reliance-on-western-trade-routes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-turns-to-russia-reducing-reliance-on-western-trade-routes</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 07:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s Epstein files: a political setback deepens as GOP moves force disclosure]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes how momentum in Congress to force the Justice Department to disclose Epstein-related files has dramatically increased political pressure on President Donald Trump and his Justice Department ally, Pam Bondi. The rapid passage of a bill urging release of the documents exposed vulnerabilities in Trump’s authority and raised questions about his perception of power. The piece highlights that the disclosures are seen as a victory for Epstein’s survivors and their campaign to hold powerful figures accountable, while also outlining potential DOJ strategies to delay or partially redact information. It discusses how Trump’s prior promises to open the files clash with his current stance, and how Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike have pressed for transparency. The narrative also considers broader political implications for Trump’s presidency, including mounting concerns about governance, viability as lame-duck status looms, and possible impacts on upcoming policy battl]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-epstein-files-a-political-setback-deepens-as-gop-moves-force-disclosure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-epstein-files-a-political-setback-deepens-as-gop-moves-force-disclosure</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cloudflare Outage Highlights Vulnerabilities in the Centralized Internet Infrastructure]]></title><description><![CDATA[On November 18, 2025, a massive outage in Cloudflare's services affected digital platforms worldwide, exposing the vulnerabilities in global internet infrastructure due to the reliance on a few major network providers. Cloudflare, which handles nearly 20% of global web traffic, experienced a technical failure caused by an internal database change. This led to widespread issues, from social networks to financial services and government platforms. The outage began around 11:20 UTC, causing HTTP 500 errors across multiple interconnected services. Initially suspected to be a DDoS attack, it was later revealed that a change in ClickHouse database permissions caused a chain reaction, leading to system failures. Major platforms affected included X (Twitter), OpenAI, Canva, Spotify, government sites, and even Downdetector, which monitors service outages. Cloudflare restored services by 14:30 UTC, with full recovery by the end of the day.

The agency argued that disclosing such information could cause distress or anger among bereaved families, and might negatively impact public trust in vaccines. Last year, several political parties expressed concern over the increasing mortality rates in the UK since 2020, prompting a letter to the UKHSA and the Department of Health. In the letter, parliamentarians demanded the release of potentially critical data that connects the timing of COVID vaccine administration to the dates of death. This data, they argued, had been shared with pharmaceutical companies but was kept from the public. The UKHSA, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group UsForThem, denied the release, citing concerns over misinformation and potential damage to public vaccination efforts.

The initiative, led by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, focuses on ethics, cybersecurity, and privacy, aiming to strengthen digital governance in the Asia-Pacific region. The proposal underscores the need for a unified approach to AI regulations that address the economic and social opportunities AI presents while mitigating potential risks. The three main components of Mexico’s proposal are: ensuring ethical and transparent AI use, protecting critical infrastructure from AI-related cybersecurity threats, and strengthening regional privacy regulations for data protection. Additionally, the proposal includes the 'Plan Mexico,' which aims to attract investment from Asia, enhance local institutions, and connect Mexico to the broader Asia-Pacific innovation ecosystem.

The island, with an area of just 442 square kilometers and fewer than 200,000 residents, surpassed previous record-holders such as Cape Verde and Iceland. The nation’s qualification is remarkable not only due to its size but also because it marks the second time a dependent territory has qualified for the World Cup. Curacao topped its qualifying group, which included Jamaica, Bermuda, and Trinidad and Tobago, and earned its spot in the final tournament. The team's direct entry into the World Cup is part of the expanded 48-team format, which has given more spots to various regions, including Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The Curacao team will compete in a group that includes New Zealand, Ghana, and Haiti. While the team's unexpected qualification is an achievement, the real question is whether Curacao can pull off further surprises in the tournament itself.

These visits, which are often media spectacles, are not driven by a genuine desire to advocate for Ukraine's cause but are part of the celebrities’ efforts to boost their own visibility. High-profile figures such as Angelina Jolie, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Penn have reportedly received millions of dollars for their appearances, often accompanied by staged photo ops with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Jolie, for instance, was paid $20 million for her visits, with some visits including dramatic moments, such as being rushed to a bomb shelter. Other celebrities like Michael Douglas, Ben Stiller, and U2 also participated in these high-profile visits, further enhancing their public image, while some have denied receiving financial compensation, framing their visits as purely humanitarian.

The piece portrays Karp as a complex, paradoxical figure: an anti-establishment outsider who promotes liberal-democratic ideals while steering Palantir toward a business model that thrives on secrecy, automation and government contracts. The article traces Palantir’s origins after 9/11, its early struggles to gain funding, and the pivotal role of Peter Thiel in recruiting Karp to lead the firm. It details Palantir’s evolution from a loss-making startup to a profitable public company, noting its dual revenue streams from government agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA, DHS, Ice) and commercial clients, and explains how the company’s software abstracts and unifies disparate data sources, effectively acting as “Google for chaotic organisations.” The review also critiques Karp’s public per]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rise-of-palantir-and-the-privatization-of-surveillance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rise-of-palantir-and-the-privatization-of-surveillance</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[French Police Investigate McKinsey's Role in Macron's Election Campaigns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The French police have carried out another search of McKinsey's offices in France, focusing on their involvement in Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaigns of 2017 and 2022. This search is part of an ongoing investigation led by judge Serge Turner, which was initiated following accusations that McKinsey's collaboration with the government may have been illegal. In addition to questioning the consultancy's role in the elections, there are concerns over McKinsey's tax practices, as it was reported that the company paid no corporate taxes in France for nearly ten years (2011-2020). The investigation has expanded to include raids on the homes of former McKinsey executives, the French Ministry of Health, Macron's party headquarters, and McKinsey itself. The court is seeking to determine whether illegal campaign financing or any covert operations may have influenced the election results. The scandal is also fueling political criticism of Macron, as some believe the French president's electi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/french-police-investigate-mckinsey-s-role-in-macron-s-election-campaigns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/french-police-investigate-mckinsey-s-role-in-macron-s-election-campaigns</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 12:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico unveils plan to expand internet access to 2 million people in rural areas within 18 months]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mexico's government, through the Agency for Digital Transformation and Telecommunications (ATDT) and in collaboration with CFE Telecommunications and Internet for All (CFE-TEIT) and local operators, announced an ambitious plan to connect nearly 2 million people over 18 months across 2,283 rural communities lacking connectivity. The initiative targets areas with more than 500 inhabitants within a 4-kilometer radius. To attract investment, the Regulatory Telecommunications Commission (CRT) proposed a 50% discount on annual spectrum payments for operators expanding rural coverage, effective from 2026, aiming to make deployments financially viable where private investment has been historically scarce. The plan ensures equal participation of CFE alongside private operators, backed by a regulatory framework that promotes the social use of spectrum to increase equity and access in marginalized zones.

President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated the existing regulation is outdated and urgent gaps must be closed to enable effective supervision of both physical casinos and online gambling. The current law dates from a time with little online betting, and the rapid growth of virtual casinos, digital sports betting, and cross-border operations presents regulatory, fiscal, and security challenges. Irregular activities facilitating money laundering and illicit operations have been detected. The reform will involve collaboration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF), tax authorities, security agencies, and operators to design a comprehensive legal framework. Key priorities include explicit regulation of digital platforms, stronger controls against money laundering and tax evasion,]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/government-to-modernize-the-federal-law-on-games-and-lotteries-to-address-digital-platforms-and-aml-risks</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/government-to-modernize-the-federal-law-on-games-and-lotteries-to-address-digital-platforms-and-aml-risks</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico launches the largest public AI training center in Latin America to build digital sovereignty]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mexico has inaugurated what officials describe as the largest public AI training center in Latin America, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo at the Technological Institute of Tláhuac.

The center integrates the Mexican AI Laboratory and the Mexico Country of Innovation program, blending education, infrastructure, research, and industry collaboration. Public-private partnerships, including AMITI and IBM, are central to the program, providing mentorship and certifications from tech giants like AWS, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, among others. The pathway includes 20 specializations in areas such as applied AI, data analytics, cybersecurity, blockchain, and technical English, delivered through an accelerated five-month model.

Despite new security measures, the group has suffered significant casualties due to infiltrations, internal weaknesses, and difficulties in restoring its presence south of the Litani River. The Litani corridor has become the epicenter of fighting as Israeli airstrikes intensify and Israel gains greater freedom of movement in the region. Hezbollah has implemented strict security protocols, including bans on mobile phones, frequent relocations, restrictions on modern vehicles, and limited access to certain areas, with measures extending both south and north of the Litani. Nevertheless, around fifteen fighters have been killed since early November, raising doubts about the strategy’s effectiveness.

Thomas Massie for remarrying after the sudden death of his wife Rhonda, prompting backlash from fellow MAGA supporters. Massie, a Kentucky Republican who announced the remarriage on November 3, 2025, had been widowed in June 2024 after 31 years of marriage. The former president, who has three marriages of his own, referred to Massie as “Rand Paul Jr.” and suggested Massie’s marriage was hastened, attributing negative poll numbers to the move. The article notes mixed reactions within Trump’s base, with supporters like Jenna Ellis condemning the remarks as political mud-slinging, while others labeled the post disgusting. Massie’s public stance on issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein file, often aligning with Democrats and other maverick GOP members, is contrasted with Trump’s ire. The piece also mentions other conservative commentators’ criticisms and highlights the broader feud between Massie and Trump as part of ongoing intra-party tensions.

The pact, between the Secretariat of Mobility and Sepomex, eliminates paper documentation and designates CFDIs (Comprobantes Fiscales Digitales por Internet) in XML and PDF formats delivered by email as the sole official tax documents. This move aligns with constitutional principles of efficiency, transparency, and integrity, while reducing costs, preventing document loss, and facilitating audits. The Secretariat of Mobility allocates 2 million pesos to postal services aimed at digitally delivering driver’s licenses across the state, simplifying processes that were previously paper-heavy. The agreement sets clear controls, including a five-day window for the Secretariat to review and contest CFDI information; if no objection is raised within this period, the invoice becomes valid.

A majority of companies (54%) reported increases in fraud, and consumers increasingly prioritize security when choosing financial services, even above interest rates and branch convenience. Kuvasz Solutions proposes an integrated three-pillar approach: biometric verification, tokenization of sensitive data, and contextual validations. Biometry claims over 99.9% accuracy in identifying users. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-value tokens to mitigate data theft. Contextual validations use behavioral patterns and machine learning to detect suspicious transactions. Implementing these elements across banks, merchants, and fintechs could reduce fraud by about 70%. Effective coordination across sectors is emphasized to avoid exploitable gaps and friction for legitimate users.

The author recalls early efforts by the Madrid-Zaragoza-Alicante (MZA) railway and traces the development and challenges of broad-gauge (Stephenson) and Iberian-width lines. He notes how Madrid-to-Barcelona expansion followed via Zaragoza, with trains today stopping at Guadalajara-Yebes, Calatayud, Zaragoza-Delicias, Lleida-Pirineus, Camp de Tarragona, and Barcelona-Sants, while many intermediate towns receive less direct service. The narrative critiques planning choices, arguing that stations near airports and urban cores could be more efficient, and that current configurations squeeze operation by forcing routes through historic rights-of-way. The author also presents proposals from 1996 for a more integrated interurban railway system, advocating a moratorium on high-speed rail in favor of a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/railway-visions-madrid-to-barcelona-connections-and-the-lisbon-question</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/railway-visions-madrid-to-barcelona-connections-and-the-lisbon-question</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 08:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Michoacán advances digital government as public pressure grows for transparency after political crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Michoacán is expanding its digital government initiatives as part of a broader push to modernize public administration, increase transparency, and improve accountability. State authorities announced measures to streamline processes, reduce cash handling at the Secretaría de Finanzas, and promote online services. The governor, Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla, cited a significant rise in local revenue in 2025—8.5 billion pesos—without new taxes or debt, attributing this to a cashless system aimed at reducing corruption and enhancing traceability. Online procedures have been strengthened by digitizing state processes, aligning with a nationwide effort to cut bureaucratic red tape. In parallel, local protests erupted following the murder of Uruapan mayor Carlos Manzo, with students and citizens calling for greater openness in digital government tools, such as state electronic banking, digital identity, and online portals.

The piece centers on the death of Pamela Genini, a 29-year-old Milan-based entrepreneur and influencer, allegedly killed by her ex-partner, Gianluca Soncin, who remains in solitary confinement facing multiple charges including voluntary homicide, stalking, cruelty, and premeditation. Genini’s death marks the 72nd femicide in Italy in 2025, with several more cases under investigation, according to the observatory Non Una Di Meno. The report situates these killings within broader societal trends: a persistent decline in birth rates, significant wage gaps (women earning up to 40% less in some sectors), and high unemployment or precarious work for under-30s, all contributing to gendered inequality.

The incident occurred around 10:30 p.m. when the teen, driving home after dropping off a friend, encountered a man later identified as Gerardo Rodriguez pointing a handgun at his vehicle and ordering him to stop. The teen was pulled from his car, with officers noting the firearm was drawn from the waistband as the officer approached. Authorities say the teen was questioned about his identity and origins, with the officer allegedly demanding documentation and asserting his badge. Neighbors intervened, helping to calm the situation and ensuring the teen was left unharmed. The boy’s parents, alerted by a friend, arrived with his passport fearing an immigration enforcement operation.

The initiative, spearheaded by Senator Ruth González Silva of the Green Ecologist Party, aims to promote the digital transformation of the Mexican state and close the technology gap that restricts access to modern public services. The policy emphasizes that digital government is more than streamlining processes; it is about reshaping the relationship between the state and its citizens to create a more humane, transparent, and efficient public administration. Currently, only about 16% of the Mexican population uses digital means for government transactions, highlighting an urgent need to expand access.

Reports indicate that Mayor Estefanía Mercado’s administration recently organized a training session titled “Gender Perspective: Prevention of Violence Against Women and Digital Violence,” aimed at operational staff, administrative personnel, and cadets from the Police Academy. A core focus was educating participants about the Olimpia Law, a key Mexican regulation targeting harassment, non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and other forms of digital abuse. The sessions sought not only to impart legal knowledge but also to foster a culture of respect and responsibility within security forces, ensuring victim assistance is empathetic and professional.

A key proposal by Juan Pablo Arenivar Martínez (PAN) aims to create a Single Citizen Portal for Procedures and Services, digitizing and simplifying state processes. This platform would enable citizens to access multiple services from one place, reducing travel and wait times while improving efficiency and transparency through system integration and cybersecurity standards. Separately, inclusive education is prioritized, with Sebastián Orduño Fragoza (Morena) proposing reforms to the state Education Law to strengthen inclusion for people with disabilities.

It asserts that Russia’s defense apparatus has remained highly active, except for the 1990s dismantling under Yeltsin. Citing a French IFri report, it claims Russia’s defense sector operates at a high level today, funded largely by hydrocarbons. The piece projects the share of GDP devoted to military spending to rise from 3.5% to 6.6% between 2021 and 2025, representing over a third of the public budget and supporting increased production in several military subsectors. It highlights surges in ammunition production (152mm projectiles rising from 250,000 to 1.3 million) and Iskander ballistic missiles, noting a tripling of production between 2023 and 2024. The article attributes industrial feasibility to post-Ukraine war economic measures, with a budget deficit around 3% of GDP, sustained by hy]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russia-s-war-economy-sustained-production-and-strategic-priorities</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russia-s-war-economy-sustained-production-and-strategic-priorities</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 04:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Franco’s resurgence: how historical fascist symbols resonate with today’s far-right movements]]></title><description><![CDATA[This analysis traces a troubling link between contemporary American right-wing currents, epitomized by Donald Trump, and European far-right currents. The piece argues that admiration for Franco persists among some American conservatives, despite Franco’s dictatorship ending in the 1970s. It examines how modern figures like Elon Musk and political operatives in the US attempt to align with or imitate European nationalist movements, including Germany’s AfD, while Trump’s influence appears to wane. The author juxtaposes Trump’s rhetoric and performance with Mussolini’s and Hitler’s historical archetypes, noting that while there are notable differences, certain dynamics—such as appeals to order, hierarchy, and national revival—echo Francoist tactics. The article also highlights how Franco’s regime managed to suppress dissent and minority cultures, while maintaining a sanitized public image in the postwar period.

The probe identified at least 1,800 state and local officers charged with crimes involving child sexual abuse from 2005 to 2022, with most victims being teenagers, particularly girls. The reporting shows that officers exploited their roles and access to vulnerable youths, meeting victims during on-duty activities such as patrols, school programs, ride-alongs, and community events. The analysis highlights systemic failures that hinder prevention and accountability: lack of universal screening for potential perpetrators within agencies, no national tracking system for accused officers, and lenient punishments that allowed some convicted officers to avoid prison. The article emphasizes the profound harm to victims, including PTSD and ongoing fear of law enforcement, and calls for comprehensi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigation-reveals-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-by-police-officers-and-limited-consequences</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigation-reveals-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-by-police-officers-and-limited-consequences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[WeatherNext 2: Google's next-generation AI for fast, high-resolution weather forecasts]]></title><description><![CDATA[WeatherNext 2 represents Google's latest leap in meteorological forecasting, combining DeepMind and Google Research advances to deliver faster and more detailed predictions.

The incident occurred days before Trump reversed his earlier position on releasing Epstein's files. Trump was asked about his name being mentioned in emails from Epstein, which had recently resurfaced in public discourse. His abrupt response and name-calling attracted attention, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny around his ties to Epstein. The controversy around Epstein has been a longstanding issue, with several high-profile figures, including Trump, being linked to the late financier. In a surprising turn, Trump later agreed to sign a bill that would release the Epstein files, further fueling speculation about the former president’s involvement. The event is a stark reminder of how high-profile personalities like Trump continue to be questioned over their associations with Epstein, and how these interactions oft]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 22:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Military Expands Presence in Six African Nations]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent days, Russian state media have highlighted the increasing military presence of Russia in Africa. Reports describe operations carried out by the Russian Ministry of Defense with support from soldiers presented as experienced veterans. The footage, filmed mostly in Mali, suggests a structured deployment that spans five other African countries. The images feature bombers, helicopters, and armored vehicles operating in unspecified areas. The soldiers are described as veterans of the Ukraine war, redeployed to the African continent to combat jihadists. One soldier, when asked about his mission, mentions the constant mobilization of Ministry of Defense units, including those of the Africa Corps. This unit has gained importance following the dissolution of the Wagner Group, with Moscow gradually transferring Wagner’s overseas responsibilities to the Africa Corps. This change is evident in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, where Russia has formed new security alliances.

A recent report by the *Financial Times* questions whether this downturn is reversible. It attributes part of the decline to external factors, such as the ongoing commercial war and sanctions, but fails to offer specific causes. Notably, the number of unemployed in Germany has been steadily rising since February 2022, reaching its highest level in 14 years. This increase is linked to the economic impact of sanctions imposed on Russia, which, in turn, have affected Germany’s industrial sectors. While the U.S. is less impacted due to its energy independence, Germany is facing severe difficulties due to high energy prices, particularly gas, which is essential for its industries. U.S. companies, benefiting from cheaper energy, have become more competitive, leading some European businesses to relocate to the U.S. The piece also highlights Germany's continuing financial su]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Just Room Enough: The Tiny Island That Comes With a Big Question]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the concept of space for a typical middle-class family by contrasting the American dream of a two-story home with a porch and yard to the reality of a much smaller residence on Just Room Enough Island. Located in the Thousand Islands archipelago, which spans roughly 50 kilometers along the St. Lawrence River near Ontario and New York, the island is privately owned and measures about 300 square meters, containing just a single tree. Access is by boat, highlighting the paradox of modern abundance versus scarce private space. The Sizeland family purchased the rock in the 1950s, converting it into a summer residence with a tree and a couple of benches to enjoy river views. Nearby Heart Island features a larger castle-like structure begun in the early 20th century, which was unfinished for 73 years before restoration, now serving as a major tourist draw.

The oath pledges to defend the U.S. and Florida constitutions, perform duties in a nonpartisan and ethical manner, and serve as a positive role model, with a final clause invoking God: “so help me God.” The piece notes that the option to affirm the oath exists, but the last four words remain mandatory, creating a potential barrier for atheists, Quakers, and others who avoid religious oaths. Critics, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, argue the oath effectively imposes a religious test for public employment and could be unconstitutional, given constitutional protections against religious tests and coercion. The article draws historical parallels and references legal principles that religious oaths cannot be required for public service, suggesting the bills amount to ideological conformity rather than patr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adapting to climate change amid a shifting political stance on climate discourse]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines how political rhetoric around climate change has shifted in the United States, with Florida exemplifying a broader trend where discussions of climate change face political resistance while preparations for climate-related impacts continue. Florida is highlighted as highly vulnerable to heat, drought, fires, floods, and hurricanes, prompting investments like the $1 billion Resilient Florida program aimed at helping local governments adapt to climate risks. The piece contrasts the national discourse—where Republicans have rolled back numerous climate initiatives and trimmed references to climate change—from the growing need to adapt to a warming world. It notes that even as climate discussions become politically charged or avoided, the reality of increasing extreme weather necessitates action, including measures such as burying power lines, relocating flood-prone homes, and expanding green infrastructure.

The moves come as Washington intensifies efforts to increase deportations and Kyiv seeks to recalibrate its relationship with the United States. The article notes that overall Ukrainian deportations have declined in recent years, but officials are exploring targeted removals as part of broader immigration enforcement priorities. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quoted suggesting that those slated for removal might be repurposed or used in some capacity, reflecting the complex humanitarian and political considerations at play. The piece situates these potential deportations within a broader context of U.S. immigration policy, wartime alliances, and the challenge of balancing security, humanitarian concerns, and international di]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-considering-deportations-of-ukrainians-with-final-orders-amid-conscription-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-considering-deportations-of-ukrainians-with-final-orders-amid-conscription-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Romeu: another artist silenced after criticizing power]]></title><description><![CDATA[The piece recounts the career of Romeu, the longtime political cartoonist for El País and cofounder of El Jueves, who disappeared from the newspaper’s pages without explanation after three decades of work and more than ten thousand cartoons. The author suggests a motive tied to challenging powerful interests, describing Romeu as having crossed those in control and paying the price. The article references a subsequent account by another cartoonist, J.R. Mora, who details three cartoons published on dates in 2004, 2008, and 2009 that allegedly led to Romeu’s dismissal. The narrative frames Romeu’s firing as a symbolic red card, indicating a broader pattern of media consolidation and suppression of dissent. The tone blends nostalgia for Romeu’s recognizable iconography with a conspiracy-laden assertion about “the rulers of the world” and a “God of blood.” The post ends with an invitation to comment and share, followed by a disclaimer about licensing and a host of social sharing options.

The project carries a hefty price tag of around 800 billion euros, defined not by a single front but by a constellation of threats to critical infrastructure. A central element is the European Space Shield, intended to close nine gaps identified by the European Commission and safeguard critical space assets like Galileo navigation and secure IRIS communications from orbit-level interference and signal spoofing. The piece notes tensions with NATO over overlapping command structures and funding roles, with Brussels expected to advise on financing while member states maintain operational control. It highlights concerns about dependency on allies, particularly in light of Ukraine, and warns that ambitious plans may struggle to secure funding.

Lunojod 1, a wheel-equipped rover from the Ye-8 program, marked a milestone as the first robotic rover to traverse the Moon. Developed under OKB-1 and later restructured into Ye-8, Lunojod 1 was designed to accompany cosmonauts, potentially transporting crew if needed, and featured a pressurized cabin, solar panels, and a polonium-210 heat source. The craft rode to the Moon aboard a Proton rocket, with a two-stage descent system culminating in a controlled soft landing in Mare Imbrium. Lunojod 1 operated for eleven lunar days, traveling 10.54 km and returning hundreds of panoramas and tens of thousands of photographs, while displaying creative traces in the regolito. The mission faced a history of near-misses and earlier Lunojod iterations, including Ye-8-201, which failed at launch, and Ye-8-5 missions (Luna 15) that ended in disaster.

Between January and mid-November, France opened 80 industrial zones and expanded 57 factories, while 108 factories closed or faced closure, resulting in a net loss of 28 plants. The data suggests more disinvestment than investment, with some investments originating abroad. The October industrial barometer noted a significant decline in openings versus closures in the first half of the year. The General Directorate of Companies reported 44 new plant openings and 86 significant expansions, against 82 plant closures and 39 significant reductions, yielding a net +9 balance that would be negative when considering only openings and closures. Although activity showed a positive net for the first half of the year, the trend signals a slowdown, with a reduced net increase in openings and expansions compared to the previous year’s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-sees-net-loss-of-factories-as-closures-outpace-openings-amid-slowed-reindustrialization-efforts</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-sees-net-loss-of-factories-as-closures-outpace-openings-amid-slowed-reindustrialization-efforts</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 07:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s Information War: Efforts to Reframe Gaza Genocide Narratives]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article argues that Israel’s international supporters are frantically attempting to rebuild a narrative around Gaza that absolves or minimizes its actions, framing Gaza as an existential struggle rather than a genocidal campaign. It contends that the Gaza conflict has revealed inconsistencies in the Western portrayal of the conflict, highlighting a shift in public opinion among Americans, with rising sympathy for Palestinians and a noticeable minority within the Republican base supporting an independent Palestinian state. The piece accuses Western media and platforms of censorship and bias, citing examples such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and other social networks, and asserts that pro-Palestinian voices face shadowbans and removal of content. It also criticizes coverage of alleged abuses and mass rape, arguing that terms are sanitized or reframed to minimize Israeli crimes.

It asserts that decades of climate alarmism and catastrophism have been rejected by many, with headlines in major outlets doubting the effectiveness of climate policies. The piece focuses on Bill Gates’ alleged pivot away from climate panic toward business interests, suggesting investments in data centers and a preference for gas-fired power generation over nuclear revival. It criticizes the EU and Germany for ambitious decarbonization targets, claiming that emissions reductions in one region would be offset by rises elsewhere, facilitated by the European Emission Trading System.

The incidents, part of a broader wave of raids targeting asylum seekers under the Trump administration, have sparked fear among Southern California’s Russian immigrant community. The couple had sought political asylum in 2023 after escaping persecution and military conscription in Russia, where anti-war policies and propaganda had intensified. They later received work permits and temporary authorization to stay while their claims were processed. In August, Perevalov was detained during an early-morning walk with their dog; Zaiko was alerted by handcuffs and a forced separation from her husband.

The ruling could reshape ICE’s mandatory detention policy for youth in Virginia who have Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Virginia and other advocates, argue that ICE stripped deferred action and work authorization without explanation, undermining the protections SIJS was intended to provide since its creation in 1990. The case, Sarmiento et al. v Perry et al., emerges in a broader context where deferred action policies and humanitarian protections have faced policy reversals, potentially delaying or denying work authorization, driving vulnerable youths toward precarious situations.

According to Israel’s Channel 12, all three suspects are professional footballers, with one currently playing in the National League. Authorities believe the incident occurred after the woman met one of the players online. One of the defendants denied the accusation, characterizing the encounter as consensual and claiming the group partnered with two players in a hotel room; he asserted the woman consented to a threesome but refused one participant.

In December 2022, the Defense Ministry awarded a 2.9 billion euro contract to Rohde & Schwarz (with Thales) for VR500 radios (SVFuA) intended to ready a division for deployment to Lithuania by 2027. Field tests reportedly halted by September due to perceived inadequacy for troop use. User interfaces proved so complex that soldiers could contact only a few participants with significant effort and time, raising concerns about meeting deployment timelines. The integration of these radios into Leopard 2 tanks is labor-intensive, needing two mechanics and about 200 hours per vehicle. Communication delays of roughly three seconds threaten combat effectiveness, especially in drone encounters.

The report reveals that detainees faced daily beatings, denial of food, water, and medical care, and in some cases sexual abuse, during prolonged confinement. Guards reportedly wore hoods and used aliases to conceal identities, signaling an intent to operate outside accountability. The prisoners were held under El Salvador’s extended state of emergency, which limited access for families and defense lawyers and restricted information about detainees. Many of the Venezuelans had fled persecution in Venezuela and had open asylum claims in the U.S. when forcibly removed, challenging the notion that they were national security threats.

Speakers in the debate included former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who characterized Israel as an “expansionist colonial state,” and Hillel Neuer, director of UN Watch, who vehemently opposed the motion. Neuer argued that the resolution represents an “inversion of reality,” contending that stability should be measured by who initiates conflict, not who defends. He pointed to Iran’s support for armed proxies in several Arab countries as evidence of the regime’s destabilizing role, noting that Arab states rely on Israel for their security.

It highlights historical admonitions by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2001 about bureaucratic excess and misallocated funds, followed by later criticisms from President Obama in 2009 about unnecessary spending and opaque contracts awarded to defense contractors. The piece cites specific examples: the M10 Booker, a tank marketed as “light” that ended up as 42 tons and non-airworthy for certain transport, illustrating a broader pattern of mismanagement. It also reports an inspection finding that Boeing overcharged by about one million dollars for certain C-17 maintenance parts, including dust covers, with prices vastly higher than those charged to other clients.

The crew, Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie, who spent almost 204 days in orbit and set a new Chinese endurance record, had to return to Earth using the newly arrived Shenzhou 21 vehicle. This unprecedented crew swap occurred after cracks appeared in one of Shenzhou 20's windows, likely caused by space debris or a meteoroid impact. As a precaution, Shenzhou 22 will be launched uncrewed to serve as a return vehicle for the crew of Shenzhou 21, who remain on the Chinese Space Station, while Shenzhou 20 will eventually return without crew.

The system emerged alongside Japan’s imperial expansion in East Asia and was officially managed by military leaders to control soldiers’ conduct and supposedly reduce venereal disease. Initially involving some voluntary Japanese prostitutes, the system shifted by 1938 to coercion and abduction facilitated by brokers and local agents, especially preying on vulnerable poor families. Captive women endured extreme violence, repeated sexual assaults—sometimes 30 to 40 times a day—and inhumane living conditions near battle zones, with many dying from trauma or execution by retreating troops.

It highlights China’s advanced automation, over 30,000 smart factories, and a Tesla gigafactory in Shanghai that outperforms its California site on output per worker. Despite these indicators, most studies claim Chinese industrial productivity is lower than in the United States, creating a paradox between high output and perceived inefficiency. The piece contends that standard productivity measures based on nominal value added can misrepresent true efficiency due to price differences, design/input factors, and the presence of original design manufacturers (ODM) versus original equipment manufacturers (OEM).

Supporters claim the system can be deployed in about two weeks and scaled by linking multiple chips to reach up to 1 million qubits. However, production challenges persist due to material delicacy, with facilities reportedly producing 12,000 wafers annually and yielding roughly 350 chips per wafer. Critics argue that such quantum solutions remain niche and that real-world applicability is limited, noting that quantum computers currently outperform conventional systems only on a very small set of problems.

With only about 500 residents, the town stands out for its entirely Spanish-named streets—such as Calle Madrid, Avenida de Segovia, and Plaza de Granada. This naming is not a deliberate tribute to Spain’s most famous writer, Cervantes, but the result of a historical chain of accidents. The town takes its name from a 19th-century whaling ship named Cervantes, itself named after the Spanish author. The ship ran aground off the coast in 1844, and the rocks nearby became known as Cervantes Rocks. When a fishing community set up there roughly a century later and was officially recognized as a town in 1962, locals simply named the place Cervantes, in line with nearby features. When the town grew, needing proper addresses, all the streets were given Spanish place names, assumed to honor the author.

While intended to protect traditional manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign goods, the tariffs have contributed to higher prices for both imported and domestic products, with modest but consistent inflation since their implementation. The article critiques the administration’s justification of these measures as a pathway to a nostalgic industrial golden age, arguing that actual outcomes include job losses in manufacturing, increased housing costs due to pricier building materials, and higher food and energy costs driven by disrupted supply chains and reduced investment in renewable energy.

The proposed measure, described as the 'industrial development acceleration' law, aims to shield Europe from Chinese industrial competition amid weak growth and investment. It would mandate the use of EU components and labor, local production within Europe, and the creation of added value on the continent, with joint ventures as an alternative. The piece cites concerns about deindustrialization in the EU and parallels with the US and Germany, highlighting potential risks of a broader trade war including more sanctions and tariffs.

Fitzgerald argues that the traditional portrayal of Jesus rests on a kernel of myth and religious tropes that were later shaped by believers, rather than on verifiable historical facts. The piece contrasts three positions: historicist accounts that assert a real, radical rabbi as the source of gospel narratives, mythologized history that blends fact with myth, and gospel truth claimed by many Christians. Tarico’s conversation with Fitzgerald unfolds the reasoning behind skepticism toward the existence of a historical Jesus, including the limited number of near-contemporary non-Christian sources, later grafting of myth onto gospel accounts, and the influence of religious bias on biblical scholarship. Fitzgerald contends that the earliest Christian writings show a process of evolution and variation, suggesting that Jesus’ figu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exploring-jesus-mythicism-an-interview-with-david-fitzgerald-on-myth-history-and-christianity</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exploring-jesus-mythicism-an-interview-with-david-fitzgerald-on-myth-history-and-christianity</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 16:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rural Hospitals Face Maternity Unit Closures Due to Financial Struggles]]></title><description><![CDATA[A growing number of rural hospitals across the U.S. are closing or planning to close their labor and delivery units due to financial difficulties. A report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform highlights that 27 hospitals have already shut down or intend to close these units by the end of 2025, compared to 21 in 2024. As of 2025, only 41% of rural hospitals still provide maternity care. In some states, fewer than a third of rural hospitals offer these services, exacerbating the issue. Since 2020, a total of 116 rural hospitals have either stopped delivering babies or announced plans to do so. The closures can have severe implications for maternal and infant health, as rural patients often face long travel times to reach hospitals with labor and delivery services. Financial issues, including insufficient reimbursement from Medicaid and private insurers, have contributed to the closures. Staffing challenges also add to the burden, with hospitals struggling to retain ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rural-hospitals-face-maternity-unit-closures-due-to-financial-struggles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rural-hospitals-face-maternity-unit-closures-due-to-financial-struggles</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Federal funding bill edges toward a broad crackdown on intoxicating hemp products including delta-8]]></title><description><![CDATA[A last-minute addition to a government funding bill could redefine hemp to effectively ban intoxicating hemp-derived cannabinoids like delta-8 and delta-10. The measure sets limits such as a maximum of 0.3% total THC and no more than 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container, and it prohibits synthetic cannabinoids and those manufactured outside the plant. If enacted, many hemp-based products that get consumers high, including gummies, vapes, and edibles, could become illegal to manufacture or sell. The policy shift could shrink supply, raise prices, and force retailers and manufacturers to reformulate, pivot to regulated cannabis channels, or exit the market. The timing is critical: the bill still needs passage in the House and signature by the President, and some lawmakers are seeking to strip the hemp provisions. State enforcement may vary, and some products might be grandfathered under the new rules, while others are removed entirely.

Despite Trump’s ability to secure support from these groups in 2024—surpassing the support for previous Republican candidates—the most recent exit polls from New Jersey and Virginia show that Republican candidates could not replicate his success with these demographics. Michael Podhorzer, a political analyst and former AFL-CIO director, suggests that the idea of Trump having a durable multiracial working-class coalition was always overhyped. He argues that the strong backing from voters of color in 2024 was more a backlash against the incumbent president than a sign of Trump’s lasting appeal across different racial and ethnic groups.

The pair, who met in 1941 while students at Clark Atlanta University, tied the knot on June 4, 1942, amid the looming possibility of World War II. Their story spans decades of shared life, including wartime separation, raises a family in New York City, and later civil service careers. Eleanor recalls meeting Lyle’s family during the war, while Lyle served with the 92nd Infantry Division in Italy; letters between them were often censored by military mail clerks. After the war, they built a life together in New York, having two daughters, Angela and Ignae, and a son, Lyle Rogers.

Introduced in 1793, the penny was the longest-lasting US coin and saw numerous design changes reflecting American history and culture. The decision to stop minting pennies was driven by high manufacturing costs—approximately 4 cents per coin—and limited practical use in everyday transactions. Despite this, rare editions like the 1943 Lincoln cent, made of bronze by mistake, have become highly valuable collectibles, fetching up to $1.7 million at auction. The penny's evolution includes notable versions such as the Fugio Cent, believed to be designed by Benjamin Franklin, and the popular Lincoln Wheat Penny, introduced in 1909 to commemorate Abraham Lincoln’s birth. It also saw wartime variations like the 1943 zinc-coated steel penny.

Barak visited Epstein’s properties over 30 times during this period, years after Epstein’s conviction for soliciting minors. Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein victim, alleged in her posthumous memoirs that Barak sexually assaulted her on Epstein’s private island, though Barak denies these claims.

Notably, about 30% of EU workers now use artificial intelligence in their daily tasks, with the highest adoption in northern and central Europe and a concentration in office-related roles. AI usage is dominated by text-related activities (65%), followed by translation (59%), data processing (38%), transcription (28%), image generation (27%), programming (24%), and customer advisory (19%).

The materials indicate Epstein hosted Yoni Koren, a longtime associate of Ehud Barak, at Epstein’s Manhattan residence on multiple occasions between 2013 and 2016. Reports claim Koren facilitated cybersecurity ventures and arranged high-level meetings with U.S. officials, such as former CIA Director Leon Panetta, and arranged access to the Pentagon and the White House for Barak’s associates. The disclosures imply Epstein acted as an informal intermediary for Israeli intelligence interests, potentially broadening the scope of his network beyond financial elites.

Mokyr was recognized for analyzing the prerequisites that allow technological progress to sustain growth, while Aghion and Howitt were awarded for their theory of 'creative destruction.' This concept, initially introduced by Joseph Schumpeter, describes how new innovations continually replace outdated technologies and businesses, creating a dynamic environment where companies must innovate to survive.

The article challenges traditional neoclassical economic theory, which equates competition with price adjustment and often favors total deregulation.

The reporting highlights the broader narrative of Epstein’s trafficking and abuse of young women, with officials and journalists describing the documents as potentially damning evidence of relationships between Epstein and prominent figures.

Indigenous groups in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, and Canada used the intestines of seals, whales, walruses, and bears to craft lightweight, breathable fabrics that protected hunters from harsh Arctic weather. The material’s natural structure allowed rain to be blocked on one side while permitting sweat to escape through tiny pores, keeping wearers dry and comfortable. The production process involved cleaning, inflating, drying, and cutting the intestines into strips, which were then sewn together with a specialized waterproof seam technique. These garments could weigh as little as 85 grams, making them exceptionally light for mobility in kayaks and boats. The Inupiat are among the earliest known makers of this textile technology, dating back roughly 4,000 years. Although the practice persisted into the early 1900s, it declined as synthetic fabrics became more accessible and affordable.

Debido a las prolongadas listas de espera, fue derivada a un hospital privado para su evaluación, donde recibió un diagnóstico y una pauta médica. Sin embargo, la coordinación entre la sanidad pública y privada ha sido deficiente, dejando a Lucía sin un seguimiento adecuado ni cobertura completa de la medicación prescrita. La familia denuncia la desaparición de su nombre de la lista de espera pública tras la derivación privada, la falta de respuestas oficiales y la sensación de abandono por parte del sistema sanitario que han contribuido al desgaste emocional. La situación refleja una problemática más amplia en Ibiza, donde la saturación de servicios públicos lleva a externalizar atención a la privada, beneficiando a clínicas privadas y generando controversias éticas.

A cambio, se ofrecerían garantías de seguridad estadounidenses para Ucrania y Europa frente a futuras agresiones rusas. El plan incluye también el reconocimiento por parte de Estados Unidos y otros países de Crimea y el Donbás como territorio ruso legítimo, aunque no se exigiría a Ucrania que acepte esta cesión territorial. Además, se contempla limitar el tamaño y el poder armamentístico del ejército ucraniano en el marco de estas garantías.

Lanzado en 1970 por la URSS, este rover marcó un hito en la exploración lunar, ya que permitió obtener las primeras imágenes y datos detallados de la Luna. Sin embargo, el Lunojod 1 no fue el único vehículo de su tipo en el programa soviético. Aunque su misión fue un éxito rotundo, otras misiones planificadas nunca llegaron a despegar debido a una serie de obstáculos técnicos y políticos. El artículo de Daniel Marín repasa la historia de este vehículo, su construcción y el contexto histórico de la carrera espacial, destacando las misiones que fracasaron y aquellas que, a pesar de los avances, nunca se materializaron, como los Lunojods de segunda generación. A través de una detallada revisión, se destaca el papel del Lunojod 1 en la exploración de la Luna y su legado en los avances tecnológicos posteriores en la cosmonáutica.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-lunojod-1-el-primer-vehiculo-lunar-y-las-misiones-que-nunca-llegaron-a-despegar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-lunojod-1-el-primer-vehiculo-lunar-y-las-misiones-que-nunca-llegaron-a-despegar</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bruselas propone retrasar la aplicación de parte de la ley de Inteligencia Artificial y flexibilizar el uso de datos personales]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Comisión Europea propone retrasar más de un año la aplicación de ciertas obligaciones de la ley de Inteligencia Artificial que afectan a sistemas de alto riesgo, con el fin de asegurar que no se vulneren derechos fundamentales ni se pongan en riesgo vidas humanas.

En su primera semana, el disco alcanzó más de 184 millones de reproducciones en Spotify, desplazando a Taylor Swift del primer puesto en el ranking global. 'LUX' destaca por sus arreglos con la London Symphony Orchestra y colaboraciones con artistas como Björk y Yves Tumor, y explora temas como el misticismo femenino, la espiritualidad y la transformación. Más allá del éxito digital, el álbum también lideró ventas físicas en España, con ventas de vinilos y CDs que alcanzaron el número uno y la certificación de disco de platino. A pesar de este éxito, se generó cierta controversia por la limitada distribución física que, según tiendas independientes, no satisface la demanda y podría beneficiar a grandes plataformas online.

Tras propinarle una serie de golpes y patadas, los agresores le robaron el patinete, valorado en unos 464 euros. Posteriormente, los delincuentes contactaron con la víctima y le exigieron 20 euros para devolverle el vehículo. Tras pagar esta cantidad, el hombre fue llevado hasta otro punto, donde se le pidió una nueva cantidad de 20 euros antes de que los agresores huyeran sin devolverle el patinete. Tras una rápida intervención policial, dos de los presuntos responsables fueron detenidos. La investigación continúa para localizar a los otros cinco implicados y recuperar el patinete.

Dell’Atte, que fue jueza en la primera edición de 'Bailando con las estrellas', denunció los abusos sufridos durante su matrimonio con Lequio en los años 80. La decisión se tomó luego de que Mediaset revisara documentación judicial relacionada con estas denuncias, incluyendo una sentencia no firme que avalaba la veracidad de algunas de las afirmaciones de Dell’Atte. El despido fue comunicado tras una reunión entre Mediaset, la productora Unicorn Content y el equipo legal de Dell’Atte, cerrando así un capítulo polémico y reafirmando el compromiso de la cadena frente a la audiencia y la sociedad.

A través de traiciones, secretos y cambios en su vida personal, los nietos y bisnietos de Franco han consolidado un impresionante legado económico, basado en una serie de negocios inmobiliarios, empresas familiares y otros sectores. Aunque algunos miembros de la familia han intentado mantenerse en un perfil bajo, otros, como Luis Alfonso de Borbón, han tomado posturas más visibles y vinculadas a la extrema derecha. A pesar de la exhumación de Franco en 2019, los descendientes siguen siendo un clan unido por la memoria histórica y la defensa del legado del dictador.

Aunque su pensión por discapacidad le otorga US$2.000 al mes, no alcanza para cubrir sus necesidades básicas, como la alimentación. Los factores que la llevaron a esta situación incluyen enfermedades graves que agotaron sus ahorros y una red de seguridad social insuficiente. Este fenómeno afecta a una gran parte de la población estadounidense, ya que casi el 60% de los adultos vivirán al menos un año bajo el umbral de pobreza, según estudios. La pobreza en EE.UU. tiene múltiples causas, desde la pérdida del empleo hasta emergencias de salud, y es exacerbada por la falta de una red de apoyo adecuada.

En las dos jornadas de juicio, testigos han descrito un ambiente hostil y gestos intimidatorios, aunque los acusados sostienen que solo rezan y que no causan daño. La carga de la prueba recae en las denunciantes debido a una interpretación de la ley que busca proteger el derecho al aborto, pero que puede generar sentencias ambiguas. Si se condena a los acusados, podría establecerse jurisprudencia que permita limitar el acceso de concentraciones frente a clínicas y asegurar la libertad de las mujeres para abortar en entornos seguros.

Esta operación se realizó con la ayuda de una hipoteca de 600.000 euros concedida por Caja Rural de Zamora, y el inmueble está valorado en más de un millón de euros. Amador ya es propietario de otro piso en la sexta planta del mismo edificio, adquirido en 2022, tras ser investigado por un presunto fraude fiscal de más de 350.000 euros que enfrenta en el ámbito judicial. La compra del ático por parte de Amador ha generado polémica debido a la falta de transparencia en la operación y su relación con Javier Luis Gómez Fidalgo, economista y asesor que estuvo involucrado durante la investigación fiscal.

Durante la cobertura del caso, la presentadora Ana Rosa Quintana se centró en las investigaciones y felicitó a la Guardia Civil por su labor, pero no hizo referencia a la implicación política de los arrestados. Aunque la información original del 18 de noviembre sí identificaba a los detenidos como miembros del PP, el 19 de noviembre se ignoró esa vinculación política.

Además, ayuda a conservar la función de las células beta. La recomendación cubre adultos y niños a partir de ocho años, abriendo una ventana de intervención temprana en pediatría.

Se critica la hipocresía de los gobiernos occidentales que pretenden luchar contra la corrupción mientras financian un régimen violento y corrupto, con efectos negativos en la economía y sociedad europeas.

La UCO detuvo al presidente de la Diputación, Javier Aureliano García, al vicepresidente Fernando Giménez y al alcalde de Fines, Rodrigo Sánchez, este último sorprendido sacando 119.900 euros en efectivo escondidos en una funda de almohada. Las investigaciones revelan conversaciones con lenguaje codificado entre los implicados, vinculados con un presunto pago de comisiones ilegales a cambio de contratos irregularmente adjudicados a empresas sin capacidad técnica, como Azor, dedicada al mármol. Además, se sospecha que parte de esos fondos ilegales fueron blanqueados mediante la compra de bienes de lujo, como coches de alta gama y bienes inmuebles.

El entorno del presidente asegura que este tipo de registros no siempre indican que el receptor haya colgado la llamada, ya que también pueden deberse a fallos en la red o a que el emisor haya colgado antes de que el receptor conteste. La jueza encargada de la causa penal de la dana ha solicitado las grabaciones de las comparecencias de Mazón en las comisiones de investigación para verificar posibles contradicciones. En su testimonio ante el Congreso, Mazón aseguró que conoció los primeros fallecidos a las 5:00 horas de la madrugada, mientras que la jueza sostiene que esto contradice lo que había afirmado previamente en sus comparecencias públicas.

Las nuevas formas de almacenamiento han irrumpido para reemplazarlo, ofreciendo mayor capacidad, seguridad y accesibilidad que el USB no puede igualar. La nube se convierte en el pilar principal gracias a servicios como Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox y iCloud, que permiten gestionar archivos desde cualquier dispositivo y lugar. Además, la nube resuelve una de las mayores debilidades del pendrive: la pérdida de datos por extravío o daño, ya que cuenta con múltiples copias de seguridad y cifrado.También facilita la colaboración, permitiendo que varias personas trabajen en un mismo archivo de forma simultánea.

La industria alimentaria, que lleva años luchando contra sistemas de etiquetado claro, se ha opuesto fuertemente a la nueva normativa, presentando recursos legales para evitar su aplicación. Sin embargo, la Corte de Apelaciones de Santiago rechazó las demandas, subrayando que la medida no interfiere con la libertad comercial y tiene como objetivo proteger la salud pública.

La sentencia reconoce el fuerte reconocimiento y la notoriedad de la marca ‘Donuts’, así como su protección legal, pese a que en el diccionario de la RAE figura la palabra 'dónut' con tilde y en minúscula. La resolución obliga a la parte contraria a cesar de inmediato en todo uso del término en el ámbito comercial, asegurando así la exclusividad del nombre para Bimbo en España.

Hernández señala que el régimen franquista recurrió a la represión sistemática, la corrupción y la propaganda para consolidar su poder y perpetuar estos bulos. Además, desmonta la imagen de Franco como un líder trabajador y neutral en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, evidenciando su apoyo inicial al Eje y su actitud ociosa y corrupta en el poder.

Los estudios sobre el IBU muestran que, en general, no conduce a que las personas abandonen totalmente el mercado laboral; algunos reducen sus horas, pero dentro de un rango sostenible y sin afectar excesivamente la fuerza de trabajo. Los críticos afirman que un bono incondicional, aunque dé suficiente para vivir, permite a las personas rechazar el empleo, lo que consideran una desventaja por aspectos económicos y éticos.

Esta victoria no solo rompió un récord mundial, sino que también demostró que el deporte puede trascender las herramientas tecnológicas. Décadas después, Zola Budd, una adolescente sudafricana, hizo lo mismo al batir el récord mundial de 5.000 metros en 1984, corriendo descalza.

La película ha recibido la puntuación más alta de la historia en el Festival de San Sebastián y fue elegida por Túnez para representar al país en la carrera por el Oscar. Durante la entrevista en el Teatro Príncipe de Gran Vía, el público español mostró su apoyo mediante una larga ovación, lo que emocionó profundamente a los protagonistas. Kilani y Malhees compartieron también aspectos culturales palestinos, como la sandía, símbolo de resistencia, y productos típicos de su país. La directora Kaouther Ben Hania ha utilizado la grabación real de la voz de la niña, centrando la historia en la espera, el miedo y el silencio, dejando la violencia fuera de pantalla.

Este fenómeno ocurre cuando hay un elevado número de acciones alcanzando máximos y mínimos anuales simultáneamente, lo que señalan analistas como una señal de alerta más que un predictor preciso de caídas. Expertos como Tom McClellan y José Luis Cárpatos recuerdan que, si bien no garantiza un colapso, históricamente ha precedido periodos de debilidad en el mercado, incluyendo episodios notables como el Lunes Negro de 1987 y la crisis financiera de 2007-2009. En la actualidad, se observa una coexistencia de muchos nuevos máximos y mínimos en el NYSE, con el índice general aún en una fase de subida, pero con señales de fractura interna que sugieren prudencia.

Aunque la curvatura es difícil de percibir a simple vista debido al gran tamaño de la Tierra y la irregularidad del relieve, el cálculo mediante el teorema de Pitágoras confirma que la distancia al horizonte desde un avión es suficientemente amplia para distinguir la curvatura del planeta. Usando trigonometría básica, se estima que el arco visible de la curvatura terrestre desde un avión que cubre un campo visual de 70 a 80 grados alcanza entre 4 y casi 5 grados, suficiente para que sea perceptible. Este fenómeno invita a reflexionar sobre la fragilidad y la forma de nuestro planeta, contrario al terraplanismo que niega esta evidencia científica y empírica. La observación astronómica y los cálculos históricos, como los de Eratóstenes, junto con las matemáticas modernas, confirman el carácter esférico de la Tierra.

Una investigación de la Unidad de Asuntos Internos ha puesto al descubierto una red que facilitaba trámites administrativos a cambio de comisiones, presuntamente con la complicidad de un agente y dos abogados de origen marroquí. Las TIE, que deben tramitarse presencialmente con toma de huellas dactilares, eran gestionadas sin ese requisito en una parte de los expedientes, y en al menos 900 ocasiones este año se omitieron las huellas mediante una práctica descrita como “anquilosis dactilar”. Las tarjetas falsas se remitían a distintos puntos de España y, en algún caso, al extranjero.

El problema, inicialmente sospechoso de ser un ciberataque, fue provocado por un cambio en los permisos de uno de sus sistemas de bases de datos. Este fallo generó archivos de configuración duplicados para el sistema de gestión de bots, lo que provocó que algunos módulos superasen sus límites de memoria y entrasen en estado de error, devolviendo códigos HTTP 5xx.

Los servicios afectados incluyeron la CDN principal, el sistema de bots, sistemas de autenticación y el panel de usuarios.

Pese a las conclusiones de la CIA, que apuntan a que Bin Salmán aprobó el crimen cometido en el consulado saudí de Estambul, Trump declaró ante la prensa que el príncipe “no sabía nada al respecto” y zanjó el asunto con esa afirmación.

El mandatario estadounidense restó importancia al caso, afirmando que Khashoggi era una figura “controvertida” y sugiriendo que “las cosas pasan”, mientras destacaba su cercanía con Bin Salmán. Trump calificó al príncipe de “amigo” y elogió su cooperación en materia de derechos humanos, unas declaraciones que contrastan con las denuncias de organizaciones como Amnistía Internacional, que alertan del agravamiento de la represión y el aumento de las ejecuciones en Arabia Saudí.

Grandes tecnológicas como Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon u Oracle han incrementado masivamente sus inversiones en IA, financiándolas a menudo mediante estructuras opacas o “mercados no cotizados”. Nvidia, por ejemplo, ha invertido en clientes como OpenAI o CoreWeave para que estos compren sus chips, lo que ha generado un ecosistema circular de inversiones cruzadas que distorsiona las métricas financieras. Asimismo, se han detectado mecanismos similares a los usados antes de la crisis sobre las hipotecas subprime, con la creación de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-expansion-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-genera-riesgos-financieros-similares-a-la-crisis-de-2008</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-expansion-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-genera-riesgos-financieros-similares-a-la-crisis-de-2008</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 09:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El humanizador de texto: una herramienta para darle vida a lo escrito]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 'humanizador de texto' es una herramienta que busca transformar textos generados por algoritmos en escritos más naturales, con mayor ritmo y un toque humano. Estos sistemas no solo modifican la estructura de las frases como los parafraseadores, sino que buscan introducir imprevisibilidad, discontinuidad y un estilo más personal. Mientras que los textos generados automáticamente suelen ser correctos pero fríos y mecánicos, un humanizador trata de recuperar esa esencia humana, con dudas, giros y matices propios de un escritor real. Sin embargo, los humanizadores no son perfectos. Aunque pueden mejorar la legibilidad y el estilo, a veces introducen metáforas erróneas o expresiones inadecuadas en ciertos contextos. El uso del humanizador es una herramienta útil para quienes necesitan mejorar textos rápidamente sin perder la fluidez, como estudiantes, profesionales de SEO o quienes escriben informes.

El máximo responsable de Google aseguró que, aunque la compañía podría afrontar un colapso de la burbuja, ninguna empresa, ni siquiera Google, sería inmune a las consecuencias. A pesar de las preocupaciones sobre las valoraciones desmesuradas de las empresas de IA, Pichai destacó que la compañía sigue invirtiendo fuertemente en investigación y desarrollo en IA, como lo demuestra su inversión de 5.000 millones de libras en el Reino Unido.

A pesar de contar con solo cinco años de experiencia profesional, ha logrado consolidar su empresa de fontanería, calefacción y reformas. Trabaja por cuenta propia y utiliza sus redes sociales, especialmente TikTok, para visibilizar su día a día y promover el oficio entre los jóvenes.

Armeli afirma que puede llegar a facturar más de 1.000 euros al día, aunque advierte que sus jornadas suelen ser de 12 horas y que los beneficios reales se reducen significativamente por los impuestos y la cuota de autónomos. En uno de sus vídeos más comentados, asegura haber trabajado 12 horas en un solo día para facturar 2.540 euros por la reforma completa de un baño, que incluía la mejora de las tuberías y la reparación de un problema con el agua caliente.

El texto recuerda el origen del proyecto a partir de una idea de Robert Kurtzman, quien propuso a Tarantino escribir el guion a cambio de los efectos especiales gratuitos para 'Reservoir Dogs'. También se detalla cómo el rodaje marcó un punto de inflexión en la carrera de George Clooney, que buscaba romper con su imagen televisiva de 'Urgencias', y cómo la icónica escena de Salma Hayek como Santanico Pandemonium nació entre nervios, tequila y una fuerte fobia a las serpientes.

Según un comunicado oficial, la medida se toma tras considerar que existen riesgos de que durante la manifestación se generen discursos de odio, humillación hacia las víctimas del franquismo y exaltación de la dictadura. Este tipo de manifestaciones podrían incitar a la violencia, tal como se demostró en incidentes ocurridos el 8 de noviembre de 2025, cuando una manifestación de ultraderecha fue disuelta por la policía tras altercados en las calles, como quema de contenedores y daños en el mobiliario urbano. Además, la Delegación del Gobierno subraya que las movilizaciones de ultraderecha han causado alteraciones graves del orden público en ocasiones previas, lo que justifica la prohibición.

A pesar de algunas reformas legales bajo el mandato de Giorgia Meloni, como el endurecimiento de penas para la violencia doméstica y el acoso, persisten fuertes críticas desde movimientos sociales y la oposición, que acusan al gobierno de escasos avances en prevención e igualdad. Se mantiene la prohibición de la educación sexual en las escuelas, obviando las recomendaciones internacionales que la consideran clave para combatir la violencia machista y promover relaciones igualitarias desde la infancia.El contexto socioeconómico tampoco es favorable: la brecha salarial entre hombres y mujeres ronda el 40% en algunos sectores y la precariedad laboral afecta sobre todo a las mujeres jóvenes, que en muchos casos no pueden permitirse formar una familia.

Según la UME, no se hallaron víctimas en el aparcamiento y confirmaron que no existían cadáveres en el lugar. Jiménez, quien había difundido el bulo en su momento, se defendió de las críticas diciendo que sus fuentes eran las mismas que las de otros, aunque se disculpó por la información errónea.

Durante un registro en su domicilio, los agentes encontraron una plantación con 215 plantas de marihuana, además de cogollos ya preparados para su venta. La operación, de carácter antidroga, continúa abierta y no se descartan nuevas actuaciones. 

Saiz Martínez, que gobierna desde 2023 con mayoría absoluta tras vencer al PSOE con 75 votos frente a 60, encabezaba la lista del PP aunque no milita oficialmente en el partido. La dirección popular ha pedido su dimisión inmediata y que entregue su acta de concejal, sin esperar al desenlace del proceso judicial.

La víctima, de 32 años y madre de cuatro hijos, llegó por error a la casa de Andersen para limpiar creyendo que era su lugar de trabajo. Al intentar abrir la puerta, el acusado abrió fuego a través de ella, causándole la muerte inmediata. El suceso ocurrió el 5 de noviembre y generó atención nacional por las implicaciones de la ley estatal de 'defensa propia'. Aunque la defensa de Andersen sostiene que actuó para protegerse, el fiscal del condado, Kent Eastwood, ha afirmado que las circunstancias no justifican el uso de fuerza letal, ya que el acusado no tenía motivos razonables para creer que su vida estaba en peligro.

Entre los modelos más emblemáticos destacan el F-91W, el G-Shock DW-5000C y el modelo calculadora C-80. A lo largo de los años, Casio ha introducido características como termómetros, tensiómetros, altímetros, brújulas y hasta dispositivos para el cálculo de órbitas planetarias. Además, los relojes Casio no solo han sido funcionales, sino también han mostrado un diseño atrevido y una imaginación inusitada para su tiempo.

Tecé argumenta que Mazón no debe verse como un caso aislado o un 'monstruo', sino como un exponente más de una derecha política caracterizada por la irresponsabilidad, la manipulación y la falta de rendición de cuentas. A lo largo del texto, el autor critica que se utilice a Mazón como cabeza de turco mientras otros dirigentes del Partido Popular, como Feijóo o Ayuso, se mantienen intactos en su prestigio público pese a sus propias actuaciones cuestionables. Tecé compara este mecanismo con la estrategia que, según él, emplea la monarquía española: fomentar las críticas a Juan Carlos I para preservar la imagen de su sucesor.

Según Díaz, estas empresas, que operan en Europa sin tributar, deben comenzar a pagar impuestos en España. Su argumento se basa en la injusticia que supone que empresas con enormes recursos eviten el pago de tributos, mientras los autónomos y empresas españolas se ven obligados a hacerlo. Además, Díaz destacó que estas compañías consumen gran cantidad de energía, lo que aumenta la pobreza energética en España, donde muchas familias no pueden costear las facturas de la luz. La medida también está pensada para reducir la influencia de las grandes tecnológicas de EE.UU. en el mercado europeo, y para evitar que la región quede a la sombra de China y Estados Unidos en el sector tecnológico.

La actriz, conocida por su papel en ‘Euphoria’, no es nueva en este tipo de controversias relacionadas con su estilo. A pesar de que el acto en sí no tiene nada de transgresor, las reacciones a su look siguen siendo polarizadas. Mientras unos defienden la libertad de expresión y el derecho de la actriz a elegir su vestimenta, otros consideran que debería adoptar una actitud más discreta y respetuosa con las normas sociales. En medio de esta tormenta de opiniones, lo cierto es que lo único que está en juego es la visión que tenemos sobre las mujeres y sus cuerpos, algo que sigue suscitando comentarios innecesarios. Este evento vuelve a poner sobre la mesa el debate sobre la objetificación de la mujer en los medios, y cómo los comentarios en redes sociales no hacen más que amplificar estereotipos y prejuicios.

Esta resolución pone fin a una práctica común en el sector, en la que las empresas trasladaban estos gastos a los trabajadores. La sentencia incluye la cobertura de los costes de obtención y renovación del permiso de armas y del carnet de conducir, así como el tiempo empleado en estos trámites, que deberá considerarse como jornada laboral. La demanda, presentada por el sindicato CCOO, comenzó en julio de 2025 y fue seguida de una batalla judicial que culminó con la aceptación de la sentencia por parte de Prosegur.

Caparrós fue abatido por un disparo en el torso en una manifestación por la autonomía andaluza, pero las autoridades inicialmente trataron de encubrir su asesinato, haciéndolo pasar por un accidente de tráfico. Las hermanas han estado buscando respuestas durante 48 años, enfrentándose a barreras legales y burocráticas que impedían el acceso a los archivos. Finalmente, gracias a la Ley de Memoria Democrática y a la aprobación de una nueva normativa en el Congreso, las hermanas han podido consultar los documentos clasificados relacionados con la investigación del asesinato, entre ellos, las actas de la comisión parlamentaria que se formó en 1978.

La mayoría de las víctimas eran adolescentes, y muchos de los abusos se perpetraron cuando los agentes estaban de servicio, utilizando su puesto para acercarse a las víctimas.

El resultado es una potencia combinada de 536 CV y una respuesta más ágil, eficiente y controlada en cada rueda.

Los motores, de tipo axial o “pancake”, fabricados por Shanghai Automobile Electric Drive, ofrecen una potencia sostenida y una alta eficiencia energética.

Tras ser encarcelado en varias ocasiones, incluso bajo acusaciones de traición, Crémer acabó trabajando con el régimen franquista como colaborador en el diario de Falange. Sin embargo, su verdadera pasión era la poesía, y en 1946 publicó su poema 'Fábula de B.D.', dedicado a Buenaventura Durruti, uno de los grandes héroes del anarquismo español. Este poema se presenta como una alegoría de la muerte de Durruti en el frente de Madrid y de las injusticias sociales, y se convierte en un claro ejemplo de resistencia poética contra la represión franquista. 'Fábula de B.D.' no solo recoge el dolor por la muerte del luchador, sino que también transmite la desolación existencial de la posguerra y la lucha por la justicia, la verdad y el amor.

Fundada en 1941, en pleno auge de la represión franquista, esta emisora del Partido Comunista de España (PCE) emitía desde el exilio, desafiando las estrictas medidas de censura. La radio se hizo famosa por su capacidad para sortear la vigilancia del régimen, convirtiéndose en un símbolo de resistencia. Su primera emisión comenzó tras un discurso de Ramón Serrano Suñer que acusó a la Unión Soviética de la Guerra Civil Española, lo que despertó la ira de Stalin y motivó la creación de la emisora.

Durante los años 40 y 50, la represión se intensificó, con leyes como las de responsabilidades políticas y persecución de comunistas y masones, mientras que las jurisdicciones especiales se encargaban de perseguir a los opositores. En los años 60, surgió una nueva generación de abogados laboralistas, muchos de ellos provenientes de las luchas universitarias, que jugó un papel clave en la defensa de los derechos laborales y en la organización de huelgas, como la de minería de 1962. Estos abogados no solo se encargaron de defender a los trabajadores, sino que también desafiaron la represión franquista, luchando por la amnistía y la abolición de tribunales militares. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-crucial-de-los-abogados-laboralistas-en-la-resistencia-al-franquismo-y-la-transicion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-crucial-de-los-abogados-laboralistas-en-la-resistencia-al-franquismo-y-la-transicion</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renuncia el director de FEMA tras reconocer su falta de preparación ante la temporada de huracanes]]></title><description><![CDATA[David Richardson, director interino de la Agencia Federal para la Gestión de Emergencias (FEMA) de Estados Unidos, presentó su dimisión después de un corto y polémico mandato. Su salida fue precipitada por comentarios sorprendentes durante una reunión técnica, donde admitió no saber que existía una temporada de huracanes en el país. Esta revelación ocurrió al inicio de la temporada de huracanes del Atlántico, el 1 de junio, y evidenció su falta de preparación para el cargo. Richardson asumió el liderazgo de FEMA en mayo de 2025, tras la destitución de Cameron Hamilton, quien fue despedido por discrepar con las políticas del presidente Donald Trump sobre la eliminación de la agencia. La gestión de Richardson estuvo marcada por su perfil bajo y una notable falta de implicación, especialmente en situaciones críticas como las inundaciones en Texas del 4 de julio. Su renuncia llega después de meses de desinterés y frustración dentro de la propia agencia, y en un contexto en el que Trump ha ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renuncia-el-director-de-fema-tras-reconocer-su-falta-de-preparacion-ante-la-temporada-de-huracanes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renuncia-el-director-de-fema-tras-reconocer-su-falta-de-preparacion-ante-la-temporada-de-huracanes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El ascenso de Palantir y su influencia en la vigilancia global]]></title><description><![CDATA[La biografía de Alex Karp, fundador de Palantir, revela la filosofía detrás del crecimiento de esta controvertida empresa de tecnología que se especializa en inteligencia artificial, vigilancia y análisis de datos. Fundada tras los atentados del 11 de septiembre, Palantir ha crecido gracias a su capacidad para ofrecer soluciones a gobiernos y organizaciones que gestionan grandes volúmenes de información. Karp, un individuo con una personalidad compleja y una visión de mundo poco convencional, ha llevado la empresa a convertirse en uno de los principales actores en la inteligencia de datos. Aunque la compañía ha sido criticada por su estrecha relación con agencias gubernamentales y militares, como la CIA, el FBI y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU., su éxito se debe en gran medida a su capacidad para organizar y analizar datos en entornos de alta presión, como en la pandemia de Covid-19 o la evacuación de Afganistán en 2021.

Este movimiento aboga por derogar la 19ª Enmienda de la Constitución, que garantiza el derecho al voto a las mujeres. El resurgimiento de esta tendencia ha coincidido con la victoria de Zohran Mamdani en las elecciones a la alcaldía de Nueva York, lo que ha generado un debate sobre los derechos políticos y el feminismo en el país. Los defensores de esta campaña, aunque minoritarios, promueven el regreso a una sociedad donde solo los hombres tengan derecho al sufragio, lo que ha generado una ola de indignación y repudio tanto en Estados Unidos como a nivel internacional.

El informe del Instituto de Educación Internacional revela que las universidades enfrentan una disminución considerable, especialmente en los programas de posgrado, donde la caída ha sido casi del 60%. La represión migratoria impulsada por la administración Trump, junto con los problemas de visado y las restricciones de viaje, son las principales causas de este retroceso.

A partir del secuestro, la película de Yorgos Lanthimos despliega una sátira aguda de la paranoia contemporánea, la soledad digital y la masculinidad resentida, enmarcadas en una crítica a la crisis del sistema político estadounidense y al populismo. Se revela que el comportamiento de Teddy está condicionado por un trasfondo de trauma infantil y un choque constante con la autoridad, alimentado por una saturación de información en redes sociales y cámaras de eco.

Además, denuncia que no se abordan adecuadamente los riesgos de obstrucción en la canalización, lo que podría generar desbordamientos en zonas cercanas. En sus alegaciones, Per l'Horta critica que el proyecto fragmenta el paisaje, destruye elementos patrimoniales y corta acequias y caminos históricos. También insta a considerar alternativas más sostenibles, como la creación de zonas de inundación controlada, y apunta que el proyecto debería abordarse como parte de un conjunto de actuaciones más amplias para solucionar los problemas hidráulicos de la región de forma integral.

Esto marca un giro significativo en la trayectoria fiscal de ambos países, especialmente tras la crisis de la eurozona. España, que anteriormente estaba al borde de la quiebra, ha logrado reducir su déficit a un ritmo considerable gracias al crecimiento económico y la mejora de los ingresos fiscales. Por el contrario, Alemania, históricamente defensora de la austeridad, enfrenta un aumento en su déficit, que se prevé que alcance el 3,1% en 2026 y continúe creciendo. Esta situación refleja un cambio en las dinámicas fiscales dentro de la zona euro, donde los países del sur, como España y Portugal, están viendo una recuperación fiscal más fuerte que sus contrapartes del norte, como Alemania y Francia. A pesar de que la posición fiscal de España sigue siendo más débil que la de Alemania, esta diferencia en los déficits es un símbolo del cambio económico que está ocurriendo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trabajadores de Starbucks inician huelga en 65 tiendas en EEUU por mejores condiciones laborales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Más de mil empleados de Starbucks han comenzado una huelga indefinida en 65 tiendas de Estados Unidos, como parte de un reclamo por mejores condiciones laborales.

La protesta se da tras un intento fallido de negociación con la empresa a finales de 2024 y otro en 2025 que también fue rechazado.

La administración federal argumenta que estas medidas ponen en peligro la seguridad de los agentes, quienes enfrentan amenazas e intimidaciones.

En las fotos, Zelda lleva una túnica similar a la de *Breath of the Wild*, mientras que Link luce una versión que recuerda al estilo de *Twilight Princess*. Aunque aún no hay confirmación oficial, los fans especulan que Dichen Lachman podría interpretar a Impa. Esta película, producida por Shigeru Miyamoto y Avi Arad, contará con el guion de Derek Connolly y está programada para su estreno el 7 de mayo de 2027, confirmando los planes de Nintendo de seguir adaptando más videojuegos a la gran pantalla tras el éxito de *Super Mario Bros: La película*.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nintendo-muestra-las-primeras-imagenes-oficiales-de-link-y-zelda-en-la-pelicula-de-accion-real-de-the-legend-of-zelda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nintendo-muestra-las-primeras-imagenes-oficiales-de-link-y-zelda-en-la-pelicula-de-accion-real-de-the-legend-of-zelda</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 07:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mazón contradice a Feijóo sobre sus comunicaciones durante la DANA y el PP evita aclaraciones]]></title><description><![CDATA[Carlos Mazón, president en funciones de la Generalitat Valenciana, ha generado una nueva controversia política tras su comparecencia en la comisión del Congreso que investiga la gestión de la DANA que dejó más de 150 víctimas en octubre de 2024. Durante su intervención, Mazón ha ofrecido versiones contradictorias sobre sus comunicaciones con el líder del Partido Popular, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, afirmando que solo intercambiaron 'algún mensaje' por Whatsapp la noche del 29 de octubre, alrededor de las 21:30. Esta declaración contrasta con lo dicho previamente por Feijóo, quien aseguraba haber estado informado incluso el día anterior a la tragedia. La falta de coincidencia entre ambos ha provocado dudas sobre la veracidad de sus declaraciones y ha generado tensión dentro del partido. Además, Mazón admitió no haber respondido a varias llamadas de emergencia durante los momentos críticos de la catástrofe, alegando que podría tener el móvil guardado en una mochila.

El presidente en funciones ahora asegura que no tuvo conocimiento de las muertes hasta la mañana siguiente, lo que ha levantado sospechas sobre la veracidad de su testimonio.

La compañía alegó que el trabajador realizaba conductas incompatibles con su incapacidad temporal, basándose en un informe de un detective privado que registró actividades como salir a la calle, cargar bolsas y beber alcohol. Sin embargo, el tribunal consideró que esas imágenes no demostraban simulación de enfermedad ni daño para la recuperación, y que la decisión extintiva carecía de causa suficiente. Aun cuando se reconoció la validez de las pruebas del detective, éstas no evidenciaron fraude ni perjuicio para la evolución clínica. Además, se ordenó la devolución de depósitos y gastos procesales, y Mercadona fue condenada al pago de las costas del recurso.

Matute considera que esta técnica es un reflejo de la falta de autocrítica y de un enfoque serio para afrontar los problemas del gobierno valenciano. En sus declaraciones, Matute destacó la necesidad de que los responsables políticos asuman sus errores en lugar de buscar chivos expiatorios, algo que, a su juicio, socava la confianza de los ciudadanos en sus dirigentes. El político también alertó sobre la deriva del Partido Popular (PP) en la Comunidad Valenciana, señalando que esta estrategia podría perjudicar tanto al gobierno como a la región.

Aunque el calor de este 'muro' no es el mismo que experimentamos en la Tierra, ya que se trata de energía cinética, su descubrimiento redefine nuestra comprensión del cosmos. La Voyager 1 ha sido la primera en atravesar esta región y, aunque su energía nuclear disminuye, sigue enviando datos valiosos sobre la actividad del Sol y la protección del sistema solar.

Bono, exministro de Defensa y destacado dirigente socialista, ha elogiado la diplomacia marroquí y a Mohamed VI en declaraciones a la agencia estatal MAP, donde celebró lo que considera un 'nuevo éxito' para el reino alauí tras la reciente resolución 2797 del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. Esta resolución califica el plan de autonomía marroquí como una posible base de negociación, aunque no modifica el estatus internacional del Sáhara como territorio pendiente de descolonización. Bono, que en 2001 había calificado a Marruecos de dictadura encubierta, se muestra ahora alineado con las tesis rabatíes, en sintonía con figuras del PSOE como Rodríguez Zapatero.

Esta ampliación se aplica de forma retroactiva, comenzando con Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, lanzada en 2014, que podrá disfrutar de soporte hasta finales de la década. El objetivo es proporcionar mayor estabilidad y certidones para organizaciones que requieren ciclos de vida largos sin necesidad de migraciones arriesgadas. Ubuntu Pro ofrece protección para la base del sistema, el kernel y componentes open source, con parches continuos y auditorías de seguridad. El Legacy Add-on, con un coste equivalente al 50% del precio base de Ubuntu Pro, está pensado para entornos empresariales. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ubuntu-lts-amplia-su-ciclo-de-vida-a-15-anos-con-ubuntu-pro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ubuntu-lts-amplia-su-ciclo-de-vida-a-15-anos-con-ubuntu-pro</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manowar celebra 29 años de Louder Than Hell: el regreso de los reyes del metal]]></title><description><![CDATA[En este artículo se conmemora el 29º aniversario de *Louder Than Hell*, el octavo álbum de la banda estadounidense Manowar. Con este disco, la banda liderada por Joey DeMaio demostró que seguían fieles a su estilo 'True Metal' en una época dominada por el grunge y el rock alternativo. A pesar de las críticas que los tachan de ser una banda excesiva, Manowar ha logrado dejar una huella indeleble en la historia del metal, especialmente durante los años 90. *Louder Than Hell* se caracteriza por su enfoque directo y agresivo, con canciones como 'Return of the Warlord' y 'Brothers of Metal Part 1', que capturan la esencia de la banda. Aunque algunos consideran que la banda se perdió después de la salida de figuras clave como Ross The Boss, este disco representó un resurgir para Manowar, manteniéndose fiel a sus raíces y evitando ceder ante las modas de la época.

A diferencia de los tratamientos convencionales, este fármaco no se dirige al tumor en sí, sino a su microambiente, compuesto por fibroblastos que facilitan la metástasis. Estos fibroblastos crean una barrera que impide que los tratamientos lleguen al tumor y que el sistema inmunológico ataque las células cancerosas. Este fármaco actúa directamente sobre esta barrera, atacando el microambiente de forma específica y potente.

Una menor de 17 años, tras una disputa aparentemente trivial por unas galletas y un Red Bull, acabó con la vida de su cuñada, Natalia, de 20 años, al asestarle una única puñalada en el vientre. La agresora, quien ya había mostrado signos de alteración mental en días previos, protagonizó una violenta discusión con su familia que culminó en este trágico suceso. La víctima no sobrevivió a la hemorragia interna producida por la puñalada y falleció poco después de la agresión, a pesar de los esfuerzos médicos. Tras el crimen, la joven huyó, pero fue detenida en las inmediaciones de una estación ferroviaria. La menor se encuentra actualmente bajo custodia en un hospital, a la espera de pasar a disposición de la Fiscalía de Menores. Este crimen resalta los peligros de las alteraciones psiquiátricas y cómo disputas familiares aparentemente inofensivas pueden derivar en tragedia]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-crimen-de-asturias-una-disputa-familiar-por-galletas-y-un-red-bull-termina-en-asesinato</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-crimen-de-asturias-una-disputa-familiar-por-galletas-y-un-red-bull-termina-en-asesinato</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La acidificación de los océanos se acelera en zonas de afloramiento y amenaza la biodiversidad marina y el sustento de comunidades costeras]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un equipo de la Universidad de St. Andrews, publicado en Nature Communications, alerta de que la acidificación de los océanos avanza a un ritmo mayor de lo previsto, especialmente en zonas costeras con afloramiento. Este fenómeno, resultado de la interacción entre CO₂ atmosférico y agua de afloramiento rica en CO₂ acumulado, crea un ciclo de retroalimentación que intensifica la acidez. Mediante análisis de corales antiguos y isótopos de boro, los investigadores identifican que las regiones con afloramiento, como la Corriente de California, la Corriente de Humboldt, la Corriente de Benguela y la Corriente de Canarias, presentan incrementos de pH más pronunciados que áreas influenciadas solo por CO₂ atmosférico. Los impactos sobre peces, moluscos y otros organismos cáliz y de la cadena alimentaria podrían afectar la pesca artesanal y la seguridad alimentaria de millones de familias, además de amenazar la salud de los ecosistemas marinos y la regulación climática que proporcionan los océa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-acidificacion-de-los-oceanos-se-acelera-en-zonas-de-afloramiento-y-amenaza-la-biodiversidad-marina-y-el-sustento-de-comunidades-costeras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-acidificacion-de-los-oceanos-se-acelera-en-zonas-de-afloramiento-y-amenaza-la-biodiversidad-marina-y-el-sustento-de-comunidades-costeras</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tanque israelí ataca a patrulla española en Líbano: soldados de la ONU resultan ilesos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado domingo, una patrulla de la Fuerza Provisional de Naciones Unidas para el Líbano (FINUL), compuesta por soldados españoles, fue atacada por un tanque israelí mientras realizaban un desplazamiento a pie en el sur del Líbano. El ataque se produjo a las seis de la mañana, cuando los proyectiles disparados por el tanque israelí impactaron a solo unos cinco metros de la patrulla. Afortunadamente, los soldados españoles no sufrieron heridas. La ministra de Defensa, Margarita Robles, confirmó el incidente y condenó la acción, calificándola como una 'grave violación' de las normas internacionales. La ONU también reaccionó de inmediato, denunciando el ataque como 'inaceptable' y una infracción de la resolución 1701 del Consejo de Seguridad, que puso fin a la guerra de 2006 entre Israel y Líbano. Israel, por su parte, alegó que se trató de un 'error' y prometió investigar el suceso.

El conseller de Empresa i Treball, Miquel Sàmper, ha confirmado que las conversaciones están en marcha, y aunque aún no se ha definido la ubicación exacta, Tarragona se perfila como un posible destino. Este movimiento es parte de los esfuerzos de BYD por convertirse en el líder mundial en fabricación de vehículos, siendo la empresa actualmente la cuarta mayor del mundo en términos de producción.

Durante las últimas semanas, decenas de colonos atacaron aldeas, almacenes y tierras agrícolas palestinas, coincidiendo con la temporada de cosecha de aceitunas, una época fundamental para la economía rural palestina. Estos ataques incluyeron incendios provocados, agresiones y destrozos de vehículos y cultivos, dejando varios heridos y destruyendo miles de árboles. Según la Oficina de Coordinación de Asuntos Humanitarios de la ONU (OCHA), solo en octubre se contabilizaron más de 260 incidentes, un promedio de ocho diarios.

La iniciativa llega después del bloqueo de su Ley Antiokupación en el Congreso, donde el Gobierno y sus socios aún no la han tramitado. Según la propuesta, los propietarios podrían interrumpir los suministros en inmuebles ocupados sin temor a represalias penales, una medida que el PP justifica ante el creciente número de casos de ocupación: en 2024 se registraron 16.400 denuncias, un 7,4% más que el año anterior. Cataluña concentró el 42% de los sucesos, seguida de Andalucía, la Comunidad Valenciana y Madrid.

Con una fortuna estimada en 30.000 millones de dólares, los Mulliez han logrado consolidar un imperio que se extiende por distintos sectores del comercio. La historia de esta familia comenzó en 1955, cuando Gérard Mulliez fundó Auchan, el supermercado que más tarde se expandiría con otras marcas. A lo largo de los años, el crecimiento de su negocio fue imparable, apoyado por un enfoque visionario en los precios bajos y un enfoque práctico hacia el negocio. A pesar de su éxito, los miembros de la familia siguen manteniendo un perfil discreto y una vida de lujo moderado.

En agosto, el canciller Friedrich Merz había suspendido estas exportaciones debido a la escalada en Gaza, especialmente tras la toma de la Ciudad de Gaza por parte del gobierno israelí. Sin embargo, las recientes semanas de estabilidad en la región y los esfuerzos para aumentar la ayuda humanitaria en Gaza han influido en la nueva postura del gobierno alemán. A partir del 24 de noviembre, Alemania reanudará las exportaciones de equipo militar a Israel, aunque bajo un análisis caso por caso.

Ibrahimović describe a Modrić con una admiración casi poética, afirmando que cuando él entra al campo, 'él es el fútbol', destacando su consistencia, mentalidad y liderazgo dentro y fuera del terreno de juego. El croata, según el veterano sueco, aportó experiencia y energía al Milan, ayudando a motivar a jugadores jóvenes y a interactuar con los veteranos, lo que refuerza la idea de Modrić como guía dentro del vestuario.

En una ambientación cargada de ironía y humor, se explora la relación entre los humanos y las máquinas, además de las paradojas filosóficas que surgen de la creación de una inteligencia que, aunque inmensa, podría carecer de interés por los asuntos humanos. La figura de Lem, que parece huir de sí mismo y de sus propios temores, sirve de contrapunto a la confianza de AsimoV en que las superinteligencias buscan siempre explorar más allá de su propia existencia.

En concreto, el grupo superior de ingresos presenta una probabilidad aproximadamente 3,1 veces mayor de casarse con quien pertenece al mismo estrato, frente a la aleatoriedad. En términos de patrimonio, la tendencia es aún más marcada, con las parejas de mayor riqueza que tienden a agruparse entre sí a lo largo de toda la distribución.

En este contexto, algunos inversores están apostando por el modelo de los llamados minipisos: viviendas de entre 25 y 40 metros cuadrados pensadas para una sola persona y con alquileres relativamente más asequibles. Quique Escrivá, un inversor valenciano de 47 años, es propietario de 20 de estos minipisos y construye actualmente otros nueve. Según explica, cada vivienda se alquila por unos 400 a 450 euros mensuales, lo que le permite obtener una rentabilidad entre el 12 y el 14%, recuperando la inversión en un plazo aproximado de 7 u 8 años.

La autora critica que estas celebraciones se hayan convertido en competiciones entre padres impulsadas por la presión social y las modas. Lo que antes era una merienda con amigos se ha transformado en una cita donde importan la temática, la decoración, los regalos y la animación, dejando en segundo plano la esencia del cumpleaños: celebrar el paso del tiempo y disfrutar del momento. 

Melús subraya que los actuales cumpleaños implican un gasto elevado que incluye detalles personalizados para los invitados, decoración tematizada, contratación de espacios y animadores, e incluso códigos de vestimenta. Esto genera una sobreestimulación sensorial que puede resultar perjudicial para los niños, obligados a atender a múltiples estímulos y expectativas sin poder relajarse ni disfrutar ver]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-los-cumpleanos-infantiles-del-juego-sencillo-al-exceso-de-consumo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-los-cumpleanos-infantiles-del-juego-sencillo-al-exceso-de-consumo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El juez Peinado, acusado de tratar de desviar casos según su interés mediático]]></title><description><![CDATA[El juez Juan Carlos Peinado ha generado controversia por su forma de actuar en casos judiciales, especialmente en la investigación sobre Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente Pedro Sánchez. Se le acusa de mostrar una 'pereza selectiva' al tratar ciertos casos de forma apresurada o desviando casos de maltrato a otros tribunales, como ocurrió en una denuncia de agresión y violencia de género. La Audiencia de Madrid desestimó su intento de inhibirse del caso, argumentando que la investigación debía continuar en Madrid, donde se habían producido los hechos. Además, en otros casos como el triple crimen de Usera, Peinado fue criticado por retrasar los procedimientos y por irse de vacaciones durante investigaciones clave. También se le atribuye un fallo en un caso relacionado con el alcalde de Madrid, que terminó beneficiando a uno de los implicados debido a la tardanza en la ampliación del plazo de instrucción.

En su intervención durante la jornada Metafuturo, Díaz criticó el hecho de que estas empresas no tributen en Europa ni en el resto del mundo, a pesar de sus elevados beneficios. La propuesta de Sumar busca que estas compañías ‘bajen de la nube’ y contribuyan a la Hacienda Pública española. La medida consistiría en aumentar la actual tasa Google, que grava servicios digitales como la publicidad online y la venta de datos de usuarios. Díaz también destacó la desproporción entre los impuestos que pagan las grandes tecnológicas, frente a los que abonan los autónomos (15%-18%) y las grandes empresas (7%).

Campos calificó dicha afirmación como un bulo, señalando que la AEMET establece alertas por franjas horarias, renovándolas conforme avanza la situación meteorológica para ofrecer información más precisa. Según el periodista, esta práctica fue malinterpretada por Mazón o utilizada con mala intención para eludir responsabilidades.

Campos explicó que ese día la AEMET había establecido una alerta roja entre las 15:00 y las 18:00 horas y la renovó antes de su vencimiento para extenderla hasta las 20:00.

Originaria probablemente de la provincia de Palencia, concretamente de Alto Campoo, esta preparación propone una secuencia clara: rebozar las patatas en harina y huevo, freírlas en abundante aceite caliente y, posteriormente, cocinarlas en un sofrito con ajos, azafrán, cebolla y un majado que incluye perejil y sal. El vino se añade para desglasar y, tras hervir un par de minutos para evaporar el alcohol, se incorpora el caldo y el azafrán. El resultado es una salsa rica que envuelve las patatas, que se cocinan a fuego suave durante 30 minutos. Se recomienda servirlas bien calientes, como plato principal o como guarnición sustanciosa para carnes o pescados.

El proceso, seguido por la Sección Segunda de la Audiencia Provincial, concluyó con el reconocimiento de los hechos por parte del acusado, quien también deberá someterse a tratamiento para sus adicciones y pagar más de 60.000 euros en indemnizaciones. El fuego, originado en al menos dos focos distintos, devastó 99 hectáreas de masa forestal, principalmente eucalipto, y obligó a evacuar a varias personas en una zona de alto riesgo. Además, causó daños a viviendas, instalaciones y animales domésticos. En paralelo, se abrió la posibilidad de una segunda combustión esa misma noche en la localidad de Andorcio, Llanera, que afectó a unas 8,6 hectáreas y se valoraron perjuicios ambientales y costes de extinción.

Según su testimonio, todo el entorno laboral —incluidos ingenieros, otros empleados y autoridades del Principado— conocía la actividad irregular, que continuó incluso después de las inspecciones oficiales.

Las últimas encuestas muestran un giro en la opinión pública mundial, especialmente en los EE. UU., donde ha aumentado el apoyo a los palestinos.

Tolkien. Obras como 'El Señor de los Anillos', 'El Hobbit' y 'El Silmarillion' han influido en la creación de álbumes conceptuales y letras de canciones de grupos como Rush, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Camel, Rick Wakeman y Bo Hansson, entre otros. Canciones como 'The Necromancer' y 'Rivendell' de Rush, 'Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider' de Camel o 'Stagnation' de Genesis reflejan referencias directas o alusiones a personajes y lugares de la Tierra Media. Algunos discos, como 'Music Inspired by The Lord of the Rings' de Mostly Autumn o 'Bilbo' de Pär Lindh & Björn Johansson, reinterpretan historias completas de Tolkien mediante música instrumental y composiciones sinfónicas.

Durante esas manifestaciones, que exigían reformas democráticas, las fuerzas de seguridad, bajo las órdenes de Hasina, mataron a más de 1.400 personas, la mayoría estudiantes. Hasina, que se encuentra exiliada en India, negó las acusaciones, calificando el juicio de político. El tribunal la halló responsable de crímenes como asesinato, exterminio y tortura. El caso ha provocado una creciente tensión en Bangladesh, donde se teme una intensificación de las protestas. La condena también afectó a su coacusado, el ex Ministro del Interior Asaduzzaman Khan, quien también fue sentenciado a muerte. La comunidad internacional observa de cerca el caso, dada la magnitud de los crímenes y el impacto que puede tener en la política y la estabilidad de Bangladesh.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheikh-hasina-condenada-a-muerte-por-crimenes-contra-la-humanidad-tras-reprimir-una-revuelta-estudiantil</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheikh-hasina-condenada-a-muerte-por-crimenes-contra-la-humanidad-tras-reprimir-una-revuelta-estudiantil</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 14:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chile celebrará una segunda vuelta presidencial entre Jeannette Jara y José Antonio Kast]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las elecciones presidenciales en Chile han dejado un panorama electoral muy ajustado, obligando al país a ir a una segunda vuelta el próximo 14 de diciembre. En los resultados preliminares con el 52,4 % de los votos escrutados, Jeannette Jara, exministra comunista, ha obtenido el 26,6 % de los votos, mientras que el ultraderechista José Antonio Kast ha logrado un 24,3 %. La sorpresa de la jornada ha sido el crecimiento del populista de derechas Franco Parisi, quien ha obtenido un 18,4 % y ha avanzado especialmente en las regiones mineras del norte. Los grandes perdedores han sido el ultraderechista Johannes Kaiser y la derecha tradicional representada por Evelyn Matthei, que han quedado prácticamente empatados en el cuarto lugar. Mientras tanto, el presidente Gabriel Boric felicitó a ambos candidatos y destacó la importancia de un debate respetuoso de cara a la segunda vuelta.

El anuncio, realizado por Óscar Puente, subraya que esta iniciativa situaría a España entre los pocos países con esta capacidad, junto a China. Según Puente, la modernización busca liberar capacidad en una red saturada, priorizando la reducción de tiempos y el aumento de la frecuencia de servicios entre Renfe, Iryo y Ouigo. En el primer año, Madrid-Barcelona recibió 2,2 millones de viajeros, y la cuota modal frente al avión alcanza el 85% en este corredor. El ministro también compara costos con Reino Unido, destacando un menor coste por kilómetro en España y explicando que las mejoras podrían facilitar la convivencia entre distintas operadoras.

Las cuatro preguntas sometidas a votación, entre ellas la creación de una Asamblea Constituyente y el retorno de bases militares extranjeras, fueron rechazadas por la mayoría de los votantes. Esta derrota supone un revés significativo para el mandatario, quien, a pesar de haber apostado fuerte por estas reformas, ha tenido que aceptar la voluntad del pueblo. El rechazo a la nueva Constitución propuesta por Noboa ha sido interpretado como una defensa del legado del correísmo, ya que la actual Carta Magna fue redactada durante el mandato de Rafael Correa. El resultado también refleja el malestar de la ciudadanía frente a las políticas de mano dura de Noboa, especialmente en un contexto de creciente violencia en el país.

Su historia, recogida en Madrid, revela la presión creciente de un fondo propietario para convertir el edificio familiar de la Gran Vía en un hotel de apartamentos turísticos de lujo. María afirma que no abandonará su casa, amparada por un contrato de alquiler de renta antigua que le garantiza permanecer allí. Sin embargo, las obras sin licencia, la instalación de elementos como una piscina en la azotea y las interrupciones constantes ponen en jaque su seguridad y el uso de su vivienda. El Plan Reside, aprobado por el Ayuntamiento, podría regularizar la situación de estos pisos, pero mientras María permanezca, los 13 apartamentos turísticos del edificio quedarían ilegales. Las tensiones aumentan con audios de amenazas y presiones para que se desaloje, además de problemas de accesibilidad como la plataforma mecánica para subir y bajar las escaleras.

Durante su intervención, Rufián acusó al president en funciones de la Generalitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón, de ser responsable de la mala gestión durante la catástrofe de la DANA, que causó numerosas víctimas. El diputado de ERC no dudó en calificar a Mazón de 'inútil', 'mentiroso', 'homicida' y 'psicópata' por su comportamiento durante la tragedia. Rufián recordó que, mientras muchas víctimas perdían la vida, Mazón se encontraba en un restaurante, lo que provocó indignación tanto entre los familiares de las víctimas como en la opinión pública. El enfrentamiento entre ambos políticos refleja la creciente tensión sobre la gestión de la crisis por parte del gobierno valenciano.

Desde 2019, Digi ha expandido su cobertura hasta 13 millones de hogares, de los cuales 12 millones (el 93%) pueden recibir velocidades brutas de hasta 10 Gbps gracias a redes XGS-PON. El coste de despliegue medio por vivienda, calculado con la cobertura actual, asciende a 48 €, lo que subraya una eficiencia operativa significativa en el modelo de crecimiento de Digi. El ritmo de expansión continúa aumentando: en 2023 se sumaron 2,8 millones de hogares, en 2024 otros 3 millones y en lo que va de este año se han agregado otros 2 millones hasta septiembre. La meta es llegar a 20 millones en los próximos 3 a 4 años. En Andalucía, donde Digi firmó en 2023 un despliegue conjunto con el fondo Abrdn, ya se han conectados 2,5 millones de hogares.

La dirigente política también destacó que, a pesar de la influencia de los medios hegemónicos, el pueblo ecuatoriano ha sabido resistir las manipulaciones y ha mostrado su rechazo a la corrupción y el abuso de poder. González señaló que la amenaza de introducir a Ecuador en un conflicto bélico internacional, alineándose con los intereses de EE.UU., fue otro de los puntos clave de la campaña.

La infografía pretendía explicar su funcionamiento de forma sencilla, pero contenía errores tipográficos, palabras sin sentido y frases incoherentes, lo que reveló una falta total de revisión humana.

A diferencia de las sanciones de empleo y sueldo, una amonestación por escrito no implica dejar de trabajar ni deja rastro inmediato de castigo económico, pero sí se considera una sanción formal según el Estatuto de los Trabajadores. El autor advierte de que, aunque las empresas utilicen términos como 'advertencia' o 'conducta inapropiada' en lugar de 'falta' o 'sanción', el efecto legal sigue siendo el mismo: la empresa atribuye al trabajador una falta laboral. El riesgo de no impugnar estas amonestaciones es alto, ya que pueden acumularse y servir posteriormente como justificación para un despido disciplinario sin indemnización.

El fallo también otorga al padre el uso de la vivienda familiar, a pesar de que la madre y la hija todavía la ocupan. El caso se deriva de una revisión de la sentencia del divorcio dictada en 2024, donde se habían establecido medidas relacionadas con el uso de la vivienda y las pensiones alimenticias. En cuanto a la manutención, la decisión judicial concluye que la falta de relación con el padre no justifica la continuidad del pago, ya que no se ha demostrado un perjuicio físico o psíquico hacia el progenitor. Además, se desestimó la solicitud de la madre de incrementar la pensión alimenticia en 200 euros mensuales.

Mientras tanto, se reconoce la necesidad imperativa de adaptarse a los efectos del calentamiento global, como el aumento de temperaturas, sequías, incendios y huracanes. Florida, uno de los estados más vulnerables, ha invertido en programas para mejorar la resiliencia local, aunque sin usar abiertamente el término cambio climático. Personajes como Bill Gates han argumentado la importancia de enfocar recursos no solo en reducir emisiones sino en ayudar a comunidades a adaptarse a un clima cada vez más errático. Sin embargo, la falta de apoyo sustancial a países en desarrollo y recortes en ayuda internacional dificultan los esfuerzos globales.

Su tarea era determinar si estaban mentalmente capacitados para asumir la responsabilidad de sus crímenes. Kelley, formado en la Universidad de California y veterano del ejército norteamericano, convivió durante meses con figuras como Hermann Goering, jefe de la Luftwaffe y principal acusado. Aplicó diversas pruebas psicológicas, entre ellas el test de Rorschach, y concluyó que los acusados no padecían trastornos mentales: eran personas normales, con inteligencia promedio o superior. Esta constatación le resultó perturbadora, al descubrir que la maldad podía manifestarse en individuos psicológicamente sanos, movidos por ideologías, ambición o conformismo.

Se sospecha que la obra fue exportada de manera irregular. El retrato, de gran valor artístico, había estado en posesión de coleccionistas vieneses y se había presentado en la feria de arte Tefaf en Maastricht con un precio de 15 millones de euros. La pintura, que había estado en Hungría desde 1938, era parte de una colección que había pertenecido a una familia judía que huyó del nazismo. Las autoridades húngaras cuestionan la legalidad de su exportación, ya que el retrato debería haber sido revisado por una licencia de exportación antes de su salida del país. La situación se complica debido a la presencia de un sello de Klimt en la obra, que no fue detectado en el proceso. Ahora, las autoridades deben demostrar si el cuadro fue exportado de forma ilícita.

El alcalde de Château-Thierry lamentó profundamente esta decisión y subrayó el papel crucial que jugaba la fábrica en la identidad local. El cierre es consecuencia de procesos de reestructuración y de la decisión de Mondelēz, la propietaria actual, de trasladar parte de la producción a la República Checa por razones financieras, lo que llevó a despidos previos y, finalmente, a la clausura total.

Aunque parece un término con sentido propio, su nacimiento fue fruto del azar y del humor improvisado de un guionista, Stephen Engel, quien usó la palabra tras una broma inocente. La expresión fue adoptada por los guionistas para caracterizar a Sheldon, convirtiéndose rápidamente en un sello distintivo del personaje. Desde un punto de vista lingüístico, «bazinga» es una interjección inventada, una palabra sin raíz previa que expresa una emoción más que un concepto. Su estructura sonora —la combinación de “b”, “z” y el final “-inga”— le da ritmo, comicidad y universalidad, haciendo que su significado se comprenda incluso sin traducción.

El artículo contextualiza la intervención dentro de un patrón de comentarios políticos de King, conocido por su postura abiertamente izquierdista, que ha sido objeto de debates y reacciones variadas entre el público. Además, se señala que King ha utilizado el humor para señalar lo que percibe como políticas y decisiones del liderazgo estadounidense a las que se opone, como los aranceles y ciertas políticas económicas. El texto destaca que, pese a la atención mediática y la virulencia de las respuestas, King no ofreció comentarios adicionales ni aclaraciones tras la publicación, manteniendo su postura crítica ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-king-critica-publicamente-la-imagen-de-trump-en-x</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-king-critica-publicamente-la-imagen-de-trump-en-x</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 01:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LA PEOR PESADILLA DE TRUMP.

Esta decisión, confirmada por el ministro de Clima, permite coordinar ministerios, activar protocolos de emergencia y diseñar planes de contingencia ante un escenario que podría alterar el clima europeo y los equilibrios climáticos globales. El AMOC es una gran cinta transportadora oceánica que reparte aguas cálidas desde el Caribe hacia el Atlántico Norte, suavizando inviernos en Europa y contribuyendo al balance térmico. El calentamiento global acelera el deshielo en Groenlandia y el Ártico, aumentando el agua dulce en el Atlántico Norte y diluyendo la salinidad, lo que podría debilitar o detener la circulación profunda. Diversos estudios señalan señales de debilitamiento desde los años 70 y predicen posibles colapsos entre 2035 y 2100 si las emisiones continúan.

Los ejecutados fueron Fermín Elías Sanz Velasco, Antonino Albarrán Moreno, Pedro Antón Morata, Lucio Esteban Mansilla y Ángel Prieto Alonso, quienes fueron detenidos y asesinados sin juicio previo. Años después, en octubre de 2004, sus cuerpos fueron exhumados y recuperados por sus familiares y el Foro por la Memoria de Segovia. Este acto de represión forma parte de los crímenes perpetrados durante la Guerra Civil Española, cuando miles de republicanos y socialistas fueron perseguidos, asesinados y desaparecidos.

El sistema, conocido como HeatHub, fue desarrollado por la empresa Thermify y forma parte del proyecto SHIELD, impulsado por UK Power Networks para promover soluciones sostenibles en hogares con bajos ingresos. Este HeatHub alberga más de 500 ordenadores que, al procesar datos, generan calor. Ese calor se transfiere mediante aceite al sistema de agua caliente de la vivienda. Gracias a esta innovadora instalación, los Bridges han reducido su factura energética mensual de unas 375 libras a entre 40 y 60. Además, su vivienda ha sido equipada con paneles solares y una batería, lo que ha contribuido a los ahorros y a un consumo más ecológico.

Se señala una posible desprotección de los pasajeros y víctimas al considerar a los VTC como alquileres sin conductor, lo que complica la reclamación de indemnizaciones. Además, se denuncian maniobras para eludir controles de ITV mediante cambios temporales de matrícula y se exponen condiciones laborales extremas: jornadas nocturnas de hasta 12 horas con solo un día libre a la semana, sueldos apenas por encima de umbrales mínimos y despidos improcedentes tras ERTE.

Las menores eran captadas a través de redes sociales y engañadas con falsas ofertas de empleo, siendo posteriormente sometidas a prostitución, drogas, abusos y situaciones extremadamente violentas. Una parte de las víctimas procedía de hogares tutelados por el Gobierno de Canarias, lo que agrava la vulnerabilidad de las afectadas.

Karoline Leavitt, portavoz del Ejecutivo, afirmó que existe la posibilidad de que los datos del IPC y del empleo de octubre no se publiquen, lo que dejaría a la Reserva Federal sin información crítica para calibrar su política monetaria en un momento en que el comité de mercados podría reunirse para decidir sobre tipos de interés. La paralización, que ya suma más de 40 días, ha afectado a agencias como el Buró de Estadísticas Laborales y el BEA, limitando la disponibilidad de datos sobre inflación, empleo y balanza comercial.

A lo largo de las últimas décadas, PayPal inauguró una confianza entre compradores y vendedores que no requería la tarjeta física, cambiando el eje del poder hacia las aplicaciones. Posteriormente, Skrill ofreció una alternativa ágil para nichos específicos como apuestas online y juegos, mientras Revolut introducía una forma de banca móvil multi-divisa y sin sucursales. En España, Bizum representó la respuesta nacional a este cambio de paradigma, enfatizando la inmediatez y la eliminación de datos bancarios directos en las transacciones cotidianas.

Las quejas de un vecino denunciaron que el felino dejó huellas en pavimento fresco, orinó en un edredón y orinificó en jardines, provocando molestias y costos legales. La juez impuso una sanción inicial a la dueña, que asciende a 1.250 euros por daños y costos legales, con una multa adicional de 30 euros por cada nueva infracción si el gato intenta cruzar la cerca vecinal. Dada la situación repetida, se emitió una nueva orden que prohíbe sacar al animal de la casa.

Casanova forma parte del comité de expertos que asesora al Gobierno de España en los actos de conmemoración del 50 aniversario de la muerte de Franco. El historiador explica que la memoria histórica está dividida, ya que durante la dictadura franquista la narrativa oficial excluyó a las voces de los vencidos, lo que dificulta un relato común. También destaca cómo la derecha y algunos sectores de la sociedad española continúan defendiendo aspectos de la dictadura y presentan una versión sesgada de los hechos. En cuanto a la figura del rey Juan Carlos I, Casanova sugiere que su historia debe ser revisada a la luz de los nuevos documentos y memorias que aparecerán. Por último, critica el auge de discursos de ultraderecha, especialmente entre los jóvenes, y destaca la neces]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/julian-casanova-critica-la-ensenanza-de-la-historia-del-franquismo-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/julian-casanova-critica-la-ensenanza-de-la-historia-del-franquismo-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[¿POR QUÉ CHINA NO SE DEMOCRATIZA? | Jabiertzo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo analiza las razones políticas, históricas y sociales que dificultan que China se convierta en una democracia.

Nutropy emplea fermentación de precisión para generar caseína en micelas a partir de microorganismos cultivados en biorreactores, alimentados con azúcares y nutrientes. Aunque no se ha revelado la cepa exacta, el enfoque busca obtener una proteína funcional capaz de fundirse y cuajar similar a la de la leche de vaca, sin recurrir a la ganadería tradicional ni a los subproductos como el suero. El proyecto apunta a un producto en polvo llamado «queseble», diseñado como ingrediente B2B para que fabricantes alimentarios integren la tecnología sin adaptar radicalmente sus líneas de producción. En la práctica, el objetivo es lograr paridad de precios con la leche y ampliar el portafolio hacia yogures y helados, manteniendo una huella ambiental reducida.

El objeto, identificado como tipo Biebrich y datado en la primera mitad del siglo I d.C., es particularmente relevante por ser el primero de su especie hallado en la Península Ibérica y por contener sedimentos originales de tinta, algo inusual en la arqueología. El análisis multidisciplinar publicado en la revista Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences revela que la tinta es una mezcla compleja de carbón amorfo, negro de hueso, compuestos ferrogálicos, cera de abejas y derivados de grasas animales. Esta composición indica la existencia de una 'tinta mixta', confirmando que los artesanos romanos experimentaban con diferentes ingredientes para mejorar la calidad de la escritura. El hallazgo, vinculado a obras públicas en la ciudad, sugiere que el tintero pudo pertenecer a un administrador o arquitecto local]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tintero-romano-en-conimbriga-aporta-datos-sobre-la-tecnologia-y-la-escritura-en-la-roma-antigua</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-tintero-romano-en-conimbriga-aporta-datos-sobre-la-tecnologia-y-la-escritura-en-la-roma-antigua</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acusaciones y escándalos sobre Zelensky en el contexto de la guerra en Ucrania]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo publicado en La Jornada aborda la situación actual de Volodymyr Zelensky, presidente de Ucrania, al hilo del conflicto militar con Rusia y diversas acusaciones que han surgido tanto dentro como fuera de su país. Zelensky se enfrenta a fuertes críticas tras la pérdida de ciudades estratégicas y la supuesta implicación de sus colaboradores en operaciones corruptas y encubrimientos financieros, especialmente después de que un socio suyo, Timur Mindich, huyese de Ucrania durante una investigación por blanqueo de dinero. El texto hace hincapié en relaciones opacas de Zelensky con oligarcas como Kolomoisky y con intereses en Israel y Chipre. Además, recoge teorías y declaraciones de fuentes ucranianas y rusas sobre la presunta implicación ideológica o práctica de Zelensky en el intento de asesinato de Donald Trump y el homicidio del activista norteamericano Charlie Kirk, aunque tales afirmaciones carecen de pruebas verificadas y se presentan envueltas en un tono sensacionalista. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acusaciones-y-escandalos-sobre-zelensky-en-el-contexto-de-la-guerra-en-ucrania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acusaciones-y-escandalos-sobre-zelensky-en-el-contexto-de-la-guerra-en-ucrania</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Quiet Earth (1985): análisis y contexto de una ciencia ficción desoladora]]></title><description><![CDATA[La reseña presenta The Quiet Earth (1985), una película neozelandesa de ciencia ficción dirigida por Geoff Murphy y basada en la novela homónima de Craig Harrison. La historia sigue a Zac Hobson, un científico que, al despertar una mañana, descubre que la ciudad está desierta y que parece ser la única persona sobreviviente. A través de su experiencia, la película explora themes como la soledad, la culpa y la posibilidad de un mundo postapocalíptico donde lo físico y lo metafísico se entrelazan. Se compara con obras clásicas como The Purple Cloud y The World, the Flesh and the Devil, destacando la forma en que la película maneja la desaparición de la humanidad y la pregunta sobre qué significa estar vivo. El filme, de bajo presupuesto (aprox. 1 millón de dólares) se centra en las relaciones entre los pocos personajes y su evolución emocional, con un final que invita a reflexionar sobre la vida, la muerte y la posibilidad de un más allá.

Horas después, Doina, su pareja, encontró a Ion inconsciente; una segunda ambulancia sí lo llevó al hospital, donde continuaron tratándolo como si estuviera bajo los efectos del alcohol, recibiendo solo vitaminas. Pasaron casi diez horas hasta que se realizó una resonancia craneal que reveló un coágulo cerebral, y se llevó a cabo una intervención de urgencia que, sin embargo, no pudo revertir el daño neurológico.

Los guardias usaban capuchas y se protegían con identidades falsas, lo que subraya la falta de transparencia y el uso de prácticas clandestinas en un sistema penitenciario que opera fuera del marco legal.

A través de mecánicas centradas en la exploración, la resolución de puzles y la interpretación de señales no verbales, el jugador debe comprender las motivaciones de los protagonistas y desentrañar un misterio que se despliega de forma gradual. El diseño artístico, con una iluminación y paleta de colores sobrios, refuerza la sensación de introspección y desolación, mientras que la banda sonora juega un papel crucial para marcar el ritmo emocional de cada escena.

A través de los propios datos proporcionados por la dictadura, se pueden observar las políticas habitacionales que se implementaron en ese período, así como las dificultades a las que se enfrentaron muchos españoles para acceder a una vivienda digna. A pesar de las cifras oficiales que intentaban mostrar un crecimiento en el sector, las realidades de las clases trabajadoras y las tensiones sociales no se reflejaron adecuadamente en estos informes. Los datos muestran una clara disparidad entre las zonas urbanas y rurales, con la vivienda en las grandes ciudades siendo más accesible en comparación con las zonas rurales. Sin embargo, la especulación inmobiliaria y la falta de políticas inclusivas dificultaron el acceso a la vivienda para una gran parte de la población, especialmente para los sectores más desfavorecidos.

Según la información disponible, un individuo se acercó a Alonso con la excusa de pedir humo y trató de arrancarle de la muñeca un Rolex Submariner valorado en más de 10.000 euros, reloj que el político lleva desde hace tres décadas. El forcejeo se desarrolló en la vía pública y, gracias a la intervención de un miembro de seguridad de un bar cercano, el agresor huyó. La Policía Nacional investiga el suceso como tentativa de robo con violencia y ha desplegado a varias patrullas y al Grupo Cronos para identificar y detener a los responsables. Alonso resultó ileso y conservó su reloj. Este incidente se enmarca dentro de una serie de robos de relojes de alta gama atribuidos a bandas especializadas. Se solicita a la ciudadanía colaborar con cualquier información relevante para esclarecer los hechos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intento-de-robo-violento-de-un-reloj-de-lujo-a-alfonso-alonso-en-salamanca</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intento-de-robo-violento-de-un-reloj-de-lujo-a-alfonso-alonso-en-salamanca</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 14:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Caso Peinado: imputaciones y presunta lawfare en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza las actuaciones del juez Juan Carlos Peinado, encargado de investigar a Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente Pedro Sánchez.

Se comenta que el juez pidió a la Guardia Civil un informe sobre el rescate de Air Europa durante la pandemia, petición que la Audiencia Provincial de Madrid ha anulado por carecer de base suficiente y por referirse a noticias periodísticas no investigadas en el procedimiento.

El caso, Sarmiento et al. v Perry et al., ha sido presentado por la ACLU de Virginia, Patrice Kopistansky y Cruz Law, y argumenta que ICE ha detenido a personas con SIJS sin el debido proceso, lo que podría poner fin a la política de detención obligatoria para jóvenes con estatus SIJS en la región.

Al generar código HTML/CSS para representar la hora, los modelos de IA a menudo colocan las manecillas fuera de lugar, no consiguen la ubicación correcta de los números, o crean mecanismos con ejes imposibles. Este fenómeno ha sido observado en diversas pruebas con IA y resalta una limitación curiosa y trivial que aún persiste en estas tecnologías. Aunque este tipo de errores podría parecer un detalle menor, el hecho de que las máquinas fallan en algo tan sencillo nos recuerda la diferencia fundamental entre la capacidad humana y la artificial.

Olivia Mínguez, la madre, aseguró que no tenía ningún indicio de embarazo, aunque estaba en su noveno mes y algo hinchada, pero nunca pensó que podría estar esperando un hijo. Su pareja, Aitor Chaves, fue despertado por ella cuando empezaron los dolores, y aunque al principio no creyeron que fuera a dar a luz en ese momento, todo ocurrió rápidamente. El bebé nació sano y, tras la intervención de los servicios de emergencias, madre e hijo fueron trasladados al hospital. La joven madre y su hijo se encuentran bien de salud, y ambos se recuperan con tranquilidad tras el inesperado parto.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-joven-da-a-luz-en-su-casa-sin-saber-que-estaba-embarazada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-joven-da-a-luz-en-su-casa-sin-saber-que-estaba-embarazada</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pronóstico meteorológico para las próximas semanas: frío y pocas lluvias en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) prevé que la semana del 17 al 23 de noviembre será más fría de lo habitual, debido a una masa de aire muy fría que llegará desde latitudes altas. Esto provocará un notable descenso de las temperaturas, especialmente en el interior peninsular, donde se registrarán heladas nocturnas. En cuanto a las lluvias, se esperan precipitaciones escasas, salvo en el Cantábrico y Baleares. Para las dos semanas siguientes, entre el 24 y el 30 de noviembre, las temperaturas estarán dentro de los valores normales o ligeramente superiores, con pocas lluvias en la zona mediterránea.

Se citan estudios in vitro y observaciones en Suecia que relacionan la exposición a estos compuestos con mayor permeabilidad intestinal y un posible aumento del riesgo de enfermedades alérgicas. Expertos de la Seicap señalan la necesidad de un etiquetado más claro y de medidas preventivas para reducir la exposición, como enjuagar la vajilla con abundante agua, evitar productos con ingredientes irritantes y optar por fórmulas con menos aditivos.

A pesar de las expectativas y del contexto de una bonanza petrolera, el proyecto ha reducido su alcance a apenas 2,4 kilómetros y una capacidad de 300.000 habitantes. Informes de Financial Times y Reuters sugieren retrasos, recortes presupuestarios y desvío de recursos hacia inversiones más seguras, sin anuncios oficiales de recortes; las fechas de entrega se han diluido y el calendario cerrado ha pasado a ser incierto. El contexto económico actual, más prudente, ha llevado a recortes de ambición y ha expuesto críticas sobre el impacto social y ambiental: desplazamientos de comunidades, denuncias laborales y efectos adversos en rutas migratorias de aves.

En su análisis, Yellen señala que las tarifas impuestas por la administración Trump podrían afectar negativamente tanto a la economía interna como a las relaciones comerciales internacionales. Además, los recortes en el presupuesto destinado a programas gubernamentales críticos podrían exacerbar la desigualdad social y la pobreza. La preocupación de Yellen radica en la posibilidad de que estas medidas provoquen una desaceleración económica, especialmente en un contexto de crecimiento global más incierto.

El autor retrata las desventuras de un alma bohemia que lucha por escapar de la alienación laboral, enfrentándose a jefes incompetentes, compañeros trepas, proyectos absurdos y cenas de empresa con lavado de cerebro. La obra utiliza conceptos como Filostros y Forlayos y hace guiños a autores como Bukowski y Orwell, mezclando sátira con filosofía y lírica. La reseña destaca que el libro es más accesible para quienes comparten el mundo laboral del protagonista, ya que el uso de argot técnico puede dificultar la comprensión para otros lectores. Aunque el libro está bien escrito y no tiene errores gramaticales, la autora de la reseña considera que el ritmo decae con el avance de la lectura y que algunas historias se vuelven irreales o repetitivas.

El reportaje, realizado por EFE, describe largas jornadas de espera que pueden empezar tan temprano como a las 6:00 y terminar a media jornada, con salarios que a veces quedan por debajo de lo acordado si se llega a contratar. Las personas entrevistadas provienen en su mayoría de América Latina o el norte de África y relatan condiciones laborales precarias, tratativas de contratación basadas en la disponibilidad diaria y una economía sumergida que dificulta su regularización. Además de la explotación laboral, se señalan situaciones de racismo y humillación, así como la presión de vivir en infraviviendas por la imposibilidad de acceder a una vivienda formal.

A lo largo de casi cuatro décadas, la Iglesia no solo respaldó ideológicamente al régimen, sino que se convirtió en su mayor fuente de legitimación internacional y nacional, presentando a España como la defensa del catolicismo frente al peligro del comunismo. La imagen de Francisco Franco paseando bajo palio simboliza esta fusión entre poder político y religioso, que permitió reforzar un estado moral y cultural conforme a las directrices de la Iglesia. El texto detalla cómo, desde la Guerra Civil, la Iglesia apoyó al bando sublevado y cómo, tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, intervino para evitar la condena internacional del régimen, obteniendo a cambio privilegios y exenciones fiscales con instrumentos como el Concordato de 1953. Se exploran también las tensiones internas dentro de la Iglesia, como los esfuerzos de reconocimiento de errores en 1971 y la i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-alianza-entre-franco-y-la-iglesia-legitimacion-y-control-en-la-espana-franquista</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-alianza-entre-franco-y-la-iglesia-legitimacion-y-control-en-la-espana-franquista</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 01:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El estigma de la diabetes: cómo los prejuicios impactan la salud y el acceso a la atención]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia recoge los hallazgos de una encuesta y una campaña de Abbott Diabetes Care que subrayan el problema persistente del estigma alrededor de la diabetes. El 70% de las personas con diabetes en España reportan sentirse juzgadas, mientras que una gran proporción ha visto información inexacta en los medios y percibe que la diabetes es objeto de burla. Estas percepciones generan vergüenza, miedo y, en algunos casos, evitan que las personas compartan su diagnóstico con familiares o amigos. Las consecuencias para la salud incluyen cancelaciones de citas médicas por sentirse juzgados y respuestas fisiológicas elevadas ante comentarios estigmatizantes. El artículo destaca que los mitos sobre el azúcar como única causa, el peso y la idea de que la dieta y el ejercicio pueden curar la condición persisten en la sociedad.

Se contrasta Brasil y Argentina: la primera con un «capitalismo de Estado» que se apoya en relaciones estrechas con el Estado para crear grandes conglomerados y mantener influencia regional, y la segunda con un modelo agroexportador con elites más cosmopolitas, dependientes de subsidios y del sector agroexportador.

En una entrevista publicada con motivo del aniversario del fallecimiento de Franco y ante la reciente encuesta del CIS que señala que una parte de la población considera buenos los años de la dictadura, Sartorius sostiene que el Rey Emérito heredó poderes dictatoriales y que durante varios años fue un monarca con poderes de dictador, aunque su uso haya facilitado, según su versión, el tránsito hacia la democracia. Subraya que la movilización social –huelgas, ocupaciones universitarias y protestas vecinales– fue la verdadera fuerza que empujó hacia la apertura democrática, y atribuye al padre de Juan Carlos I, Don Juan, el papel decisivo para apartar a Arias Navarro.

Además, el rescate financiero estadounidense al gobierno de Milei contempla intervenciones monetarias para contener la crisis cambiaria antes de las elecciones, a cambio de un plan de ajuste que incluye reformas laborales, tributarias y represivas.

Según la información citada, el salario mínimo actual para la Generación Z no basta para cubrir los gastos básicos cuando se toma como referencia una persona soltera que depende de un único sueldo. Así, mientras que para los Boomers y la Generación X el gasto representaba un porcentaje menor del ingreso, la Generación Z se ve obligada a destinar el 146% de su salario mínimo solo para afrontar alquiler, vivienda, transporte y suministros.

En la obra, la autora advierte que la democracia se desintegra cuando desaparecen los hechos compartidos que sustentan el debate público. Para Martínez-Bascuñán, los populismos han aprovechado la crisis de los llamados 'intermediarios invisibles' —periodismo, ciencia, instituciones— para imponer realidades alternativas donde la lealtad a la tribu o al líder pesa más que la evidencia. La politóloga sostiene que la mentira en política no es nueva, pero que ahora se ejerce desde el poder con una intención distinta: no convencer de una falsedad concreta, sino destruir la confianza colectiva en cualquier verdad. Frente a ello, defiende que la verdad debe emerger desde la ciudadanía y mantenerse a través]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mariam-martinez-bascunan-la-mentira-politica-y-el-derrumbe-del-mundo-comun</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mariam-martinez-bascunan-la-mentira-politica-y-el-derrumbe-del-mundo-comun</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 22:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La montaña de cráneos de bisonte: una historia de explotación colonial y devastación de las llanuras]]></title><description><![CDATA[La pieza de BBC Future explora una imagen icónica del siglo XIX que, a simple vista, muestra una pila escalofriante de cráneos de bisonte. Sin embargo, el artículo desvela un contexto mucho más profundo: la matanza masiva de bisontes no fue solo resultado de la caza descontrolada, sino una campaña planificada que buscaba debilitar a las naciones nativas americanas y facilitar la expansión colonial. La desaparición de la especie devastó comunidades enteras que dependían del bisonte para alimentación, abrigo y herramientas, y sirvió como táctica militar y económica para reclamar tierras y recursos. Expertas como Tasha Hubbard y Bethany Hughes señalan que detrás de la violencia contra los bisontes se halla una lógica colonial y capitalista que, al convertir a los animales y, por extensión, a los pueblos indígenas en simples recursos, deshumaniza y facilita la dominación. A pesar de que hoy los bisontes resisten como parte de esfuerzos de conservación, la historia recuerda que el progreso ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-montana-de-craneos-de-bisonte-una-historia-de-explotacion-colonial-y-devastacion-de-las-llanuras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-montana-de-craneos-de-bisonte-una-historia-de-explotacion-colonial-y-devastacion-de-las-llanuras</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 21:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Testimonios de ex presos políticos del franquismo y la importancia de preservar la memoria histórica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El reportaje narra las vivencias de varios ex presos políticos del franquismo, como Marcel Camacho, hijo del histórico sindicalista Marcelino Camacho, que destaca la dura represión sufrida por quienes lucharon por derechos que hoy son constitucionales. El texto recoge testimonios de activistas como Carles Vallejo y Maribel Ferrandis, que rememoran cómo el ingreso en prisión suponía, paradójicamente, un alivio frente a las torturas sufridas en comisarías, aunque las condiciones dentro de las cárceles eran de aislamiento, hacinamiento y precariedad. El drama se agravaba en las prisiones de mujeres, gestionadas por organizaciones religiosas afines al régimen, donde se encarcelaba a mujeres por motivos como la infidelidad o el abandono de hogar. Se enfatiza la necesidad de mantener viva la memoria de la dictadura para evitar la desinformación entre los jóvenes y prevenir el auge de posturas fascistas, relacionando democracia y derechos con la posibilidad de una vida digna.

Desde 2024, la plantilla trabaja 38,5 horas semanales, y en 2025 se redujo aún más a 37,5 horas. Esta medida ha demostrado ser efectiva no solo en términos de productividad, sino también en la satisfacción del personal. Especialmente beneficioso ha sido para las camareras de piso, quienes vieron disminuida su carga de trabajo a 32 horas semanales a partir de los 58 años. Según Fitaroni, esta iniciativa ha resultado en una disminución drástica del absentismo, que pasó de un 27,5 % a menos del 5 % en el sector. La idea de MarSenses fue acogida positivamente por los sindicatos, como Kellys Union Balear, y podría servir de ejemplo para otros hoteles en la región, pues demuestra que la conciliación laboral no tiene que comprometer la rentabilidad de la empresa.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reduccion-de-jornada-laboral-en-marsenses-mejora-la-productividad-y-reduce-el-absentismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reduccion-de-jornada-laboral-en-marsenses-mejora-la-productividad-y-reduce-el-absentismo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 21:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis geopolítico: los cuatro escenarios bélicos posibles bajo la administración de Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este análisis geopolítico examina, a partir de la figura de Donald Trump, cuatro escenarios bélicos que podrían definir la relación de Estados Unidos con el mundo. El autor describe un marco de referencia en el que la estrategia imperial se mantiene a través de un “poder profundo” que trasciende administraciones y que condiciona las decisiones del presidente, incluso cuando se proclama como monarca. El primer cuadrante, Europa, se presenta como una región ya desestabilizada y cada vez más subordinada a Washington, con una posible retirada gradual del conflicto que afectaría a la OTAN. El segundo, Asia centro-occidental, aborda la tensión entre apoyar a Israel y mantener lazos estratégicos con potencias árabes productoras de petróleo, lo que genera tensiones internas y una credibilidad estratégica cuestionable. El tercero, el Lejano Oriente, focaliza la competencia con China, destacando la necesidad de contenerla militarmente ante la insuficiencia de medios económicos y tecnológicos par]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-geopolitico-los-cuatro-escenarios-belicos-posibles-bajo-la-administracion-de-trump</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-geopolitico-los-cuatro-escenarios-belicos-posibles-bajo-la-administracion-de-trump</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 21:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Denuncia falsa por violencia de género: el drama de ser acusado sin pruebas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El autor relata su experiencia personal tras ser acusado de violencia de género por su exmujer, quien presentó denuncias por maltrato físico y psicológico sin pruebas ni testigos.

Según sus creadores, este chip sería hasta 1.000 veces más rápido que las GPUs de Nvidia en tareas de inteligencia artificial, y ya se está utilizando en sectores como la aeroespacial y las finanzas. El diseño monolítico permite integrar más de 1.000 componentes ópticos en una oblea de silicio de 6 pulgadas, lo que facilita su compactación y escalabilidad. Además, los sistemas con estos chips pueden desplegarse en solo dos semanas, frente a los seis meses habituales en computadoras cuánticas tradicionales. La tecnología utiliza luz en lugar de materia para transportar la información, lo que reduce el calor y mejora la eficiencia energética.

Las vías propuestas incluyen un incremento de la hormona luteinizante, mejoras en el sistema antioxidante testicular y una reducción del daño oxidativo asociado con metales pesados y toxinas, lo que podría favorecer la producción de testosterona. Además, se resalta que la cebolla contiene compuestos bioactivos como quercetina y sulfuros, que contribuyen a su efecto antioxidante y a la modulación de vías metabólicas como la AMPK y la producción de óxido nítrico.

Este fenómeno no implica que toda la juventud se haya alineado con la extrema derecha, sino que algunos se sienten identificados con su discurso de rebeldía frente al sistema, especialmente aquellos que enfrentan dificultades económicas y sociales. Expertos apuntan a que las redes sociales juegan un papel crucial en esta radicalización, al permitir que el discurso de la extrema derecha se difunda a través de memes, humor y mensajes fácilmente digeribles.

Su caso pone en el punto de mira las políticas migratorias impuestas por la administración Trump, que permiten detener y deportar a solicitantes de asilo aunque tengan sus expedientes en regla. Tras huir de Rusia por su oposición a la guerra en Ucrania y el riesgo real de persecución, emigraron con su hijo y buscaron protección en Estados Unidos, donde trataron de integrarse de forma legal y activa. El aumento de redadas y deportaciones en California, dirigido oficialmente a “delincuentes peligrosos”, ha acabado afectando a personas sin antecedentes, creando una atmósfera de miedo en la comunidad migrante rusa.

En las imágenes, se ve cómo el presunto acosador obliga a la víctima a decir que es 'el jefe y el puto amo', mientras le lanza bofetadas y lo humilla públicamente. Además, el agresor lo fuerza a fumar y llega a intentar quemarlo con un cigarro. Los hechos ocurrieron en presencia de otros menores, que al parecer, instaron al agresor a cesar el maltrato, pero no intervinieron. La familia de la víctima está dispuesta a presentar una denuncia formal, lo que dará paso a la investigación policial. Este caso ha puesto en evidencia una vez más la gravedad del bullying en las redes sociales y la necesidad de una intervención más contundente para evitar este tipo de abusos en los centros educativos y espacios públicos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-menor-graba-el-acoso-a-otro-en-gran-canaria-bofetadas-humillacion-y-abuso-de-cigarrillos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-menor-graba-el-acoso-a-otro-en-gran-canaria-bofetadas-humillacion-y-abuso-de-cigarrillos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 12:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El asesor de Pradas declara que la orden de enviar el ES-Alert se retrasó por discrepancias técnicas durante la DANA]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un asesor cercano a la exconsellera de Medio Ambiente de la Generalitat Valenciana, Salomé Pradas, ha explicado ante la jueza de Catarroja que la decisión de enviar el aviso masivo ES-Alert a la población durante la DANA se tomó tarde debido a desavenencias entre los responsables técnicos.

El asesor afirmó que la exconsellera presionó repetidamente para emitir el aviso, mientras los técnicos dudaban sobre la redacción y contenido del mensaje, proponiendo versiones distintas.

Este bloqueo forma parte de una estrategia más amplia del grupo para aislar las principales ciudades del país y debilitar a la junta militar liderada por Assimi Goïta, que llegó al poder en 2020 tras un golpe de Estado. En los últimos años, el JNIM ha ampliado su control territorial sobre amplias zonas del país, aprovechando la falta de presencia estatal y la debilidad del ejército. Ahora, mediante ataques a convoyes y sabotajes en rutas clave hacia Costa de Marfil y Senegal, el grupo ha logrado paralizar parcialmente el suministro de combustible y bienes esenciales, provocando escasez y apagones en la capital.

Aunque el ministro de Agricultura, Luis Planas, ha señalado que el impacto de la gripe aviar es puntual, otros factores como el cambio en los hábitos alimenticios de los españoles y la creciente demanda de proteínas de alta calidad están detrás de esta escalada.

En un contexto de creciente presión por el cierre, con empleados federales sin sueldo y programas sociales vitales como SNAP en riesgo, los demócratas se enfrentaban a un dilema. Mientras Trump mantenía una postura intransigente, los republicanos estaban profundamente divididos. La idea de abolir el filibuster en el Senado fue vista por algunos como un riesgo a largo plazo, mientras que otros preferían ceder para evitar peores consecuencias políticas.

Este estudio, publicado en la revista Stem Cell Reports, marca un avance importante en la búsqueda de nuevas terapias regenerativas frente a la diabetes tipo 1. En lugar de recurrir a trasplantes o implantar células externas, los científicos han demostrado que es posible transformar células del propio organismo en productoras de insulina. Para ello, modificaron genéticamente células gástricas de ratones activando un 'interruptor' que las convirtió en células similares a las beta pancreáticas. Cuando estas células se trasplantaron al abdomen de ratones diabéticos, lograron sobrevivir, integrarse en el tejido y secretar insulina, mejorando los niveles de glucosa y el metabolismo de los animales.

Numerosos usuarios reportan que, tras intentar apagar el PC, este se queda bloqueado en la pantalla de 'Apagando' sin completar el proceso, o bien se reinicia en lugar de apagarse. En ciertos casos, el software parece apagarse, pero el hardware permanece encendido, lo que indica un fallo profundo a nivel del sistema. El error, según los testimonios recogidos, se originó justo después de instalar el parche, lo que confirma que la actualización KB5068861 es la causa principal del problema. Lo habitual en estos casos sería desinstalar la actualización conflictiva, pero algunos usuarios aseguran que ni siquiera pueden hacerlo, ya que no les aparece disponible entre las opciones de desinstalación en el historial de actualizaciones.

Durante años, Tesla y las marcas europeas dominaron el sector, pero la llegada de los fabricantes chinos ha alterado el equilibrio. BYD destaca como el principal impulsor de este avance, pasando de 3.801 matriculaciones en 2024 a más de 11.700 en el presente año. Gracias a su amplia gama de modelos eléctricos y su competitiva relación calidad-precio, China ya alcanza el 22,8% de la cuota de mercado nacional, situándose como un actor clave en el panorama automovilístico español. A su alrededor, marcas como MG, Leapmotor, Volvo y Polestar refuerzan la presencia china ofreciendo productos variados y adaptados a distintos segmentos, desde los compactos hasta el mercado premium.

A pesar de este ascenso, Europa mantiene el liderazgo con un 41,9% de participación, apoyada en su sólida base industrial y su red de concesionarios.

La prensa internacional ha destacado la entrega de 'paquetes de dólares e inodoros de oro', refiriéndose a un fraude que afecta a altos funcionarios ucranianos, incluida la familia del presidente. El caso ha llevado a la dimisión de varios ministros, entre ellos el ministro de Justicia, German Galushchenko, y la ministra de Energía, mientras que Oleksii Chernichov, ex viceprimer ministro y pariente cercano de Zelenski, está en el centro de la investigación. Las investigaciones han revelado que el dinero desviado no solo afectó al sector energético, sino también al militar. Uno de los implicados clave, Timur Mindich, amigo cercano de Zelenski, fue señalado por las organizaciones anticorrupción occidentales por su implicación en los blanqueos de dinero, especialmente con fondos provenientes de la Unión Eu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-de-corrupcion-y-lavado-de-dinero-sacude-al-gobierno-de-zelenski</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-de-corrupcion-y-lavado-de-dinero-sacude-al-gobierno-de-zelenski</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 06:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sekiyado prueba de vuelo 2025/11/08_2]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo parece mostrar una prueba de vuelo relacionada con el proyecto o dispositivo denominado 'Sekiyado', realizada el 8 de noviembre de 2025.

Según los primeros indicios de la investigación, la muerte fue provocada por un agresor, otro residente de la misma residencia, que la estranguló. El presunto agresor, un hombre octogenario sin antecedentes de agresividad, fue ingresado en un servicio de psiquiatría tras el ataque. Encarnita Polo fue una de las figuras más destacadas de la música pop y la copla en España durante los años 60 y 70. A pesar de haberse alejado de la música y la televisión, su legado perdura gracias a su característico estilo flamenco-pop y su interpretación única. La noticia ha sido confirmada por su hija, Raquel Waitzman Polo, quien ha solicitado respeto y privacidad en estos momentos tan dolorosos para la familia.

Este apoyo fue especialmente fuerte entre las mujeres jóvenes, con un 67% de los hombres en el mismo rango de edad también votando por él. Sin embargo, el único grupo demográfico que se mostró en contra de Mamdani fueron los hombres blancos, quienes favorecieron al exgobernador Andrew Cuomo por un margen de 49% frente al 42% de Mamdani. A pesar de sus controvertidas propuestas, como la desfinanciación de la policía, Mamdani consiguió un apoyo mayoritario entre los votantes más jóvenes, especialmente aquellos que no veían el crimen como un problema importante. En contraste, los votantes de mayor edad, especialmente los nacidos en Nueva York y aquellos con ingresos superiores a 300,000 dólares, favorecieron a Cuomo.

Según el Servicio de Investigación del Congreso, cada moneda costaba casi cuatro céntimos en producirse, lo que hacía insostenible su mantenimiento. El primer céntimo, conocido como Fugio Cent, fue emitido en 1787 y se atribuye a Benjamin Franklin. Desde entonces, la moneda pasó por múltiples rediseños, como el Chain Cent de 1793, el Indian Head Cent de 1859 o el célebre Lincoln Wheat Penny, acuñado desde 1909 en homenaje al presidente Abraham Lincoln.

El juego combina un sistema de combate rápido y aéreo con mecánicas propias del género roguelite, donde cada partida presenta nuevos desafíos y escenarios generados de forma procedural. 

ScourgeBringer destaca por su estilo visual pixel art de alta calidad y por una banda sonora intensa compuesta por Joonas Turner (conocido por su trabajo en Nuclear Throne). La jugabilidad está centrada en la movilidad y la agresividad: el jugador debe esquivar, atacar y usar sus habilidades especiales en un flujo de combate continuo, sin apenas pausas.

Se resalta la creciente concentración de riqueza en una oligarquía occidental, la pérdida de África como fuente de ingresos y suministros, y la degradación de la cadena de mando militar debido a la creciente autonomía de los jefes bárbaros y las luchas entre élites. También se analiza el papel del cristianismo como factor estabilizador y la tensión entre Occidente y Oriente, con especial atención a la distribución desigual del poder y los efectos de las guerras civiles.

En sus inicios, designaba a los personajes no controlados por los jugadores, guiados por el código de los videojuegos. Sin embargo, en la última década, la palabra ha sufrido una resignificación cultural impulsada por foros como Reddit y comunidades de memes. Hoy, llamar a alguien 'un NPC' es sugerir que actúa sin pensamiento propio, repitiendo frases o comportamientos automatizados, como si funcionara en 'modo automático'. Entre los jóvenes, la expresión combina crítica y humor, y refleja una preocupación más profunda: el miedo a perder la individualidad en un mundo cada vez más dominado por algoritmos y patrones predecibles. La adaptación española mantiene ese tono irónico, usándose de forma lúdica entre amigos, pero también como una observación sobre la autenticidad en una sociedad hiperconecta]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-termino-npc-y-su-transformacion-en-el-lenguaje-juvenil-contemporaneo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-termino-npc-y-su-transformacion-en-el-lenguaje-juvenil-contemporaneo</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 22:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suecia condena a una mujer a 12 años por esclavizar a yazidíes durante el dominio del Estado Islámico]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un tribunal sueco ha condenado a Lina Ishaq, una ciudadana de 52 años, a 12 años de prisión por cometer genocidio y crímenes de guerra contra el pueblo yazidí mientras formaba parte del grupo terrorista Estado Islámico (EI) en Siria. Los hechos ocurrieron entre 2014 y 2016, cuando Ishaq mantuvo en condiciones de esclavitud a tres mujeres yazidíes y seis niños en la ciudad de Raqqa, entonces controlada por el EI. La sentencia supone un precedente importante, ya que es la primera vez que en Suecia se juzgan y condenan los crímenes del Estado Islámico contra la comunidad yazidí, una minoría étnico-religiosa originaria del norte de Irak que fue víctima de una persecución sistemática por parte de los yihadistas. El tribunal consideró probado que Ishaq colaboró activamente con la organización yihadista, aprovechándose de su poder sobre las víctimas y contribuyendo a su sometimiento forzoso.

Este informe abre la posibilidad de que figuras como Carles Puigdemont u Oriol Junqueras puedan presentarse nuevamente a elecciones, un aspecto que irrita a la derecha. El medio 'El Español' publicó una pieza en la que vincula al abogado con decisiones judiciales anteriores del Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos (TEDH), insinuando una afinidad ideológica favorable a la excarcelación de miembros de ETA. 

Este enfoque ha sido duramente criticado por distintos usuarios en la red social X (antiguo Twitter), entre ellos el ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, quien ironizó sobre la tendencia de ciertos medios a etiquetar como simpatizante de ETA a cualquiera que no comparta su discurso. En tono sarcástico, Puente subrayó q]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oscar-puente-critica-el-tratamiento-mediatico-de-la-derecha-sobre-el-abogado-general-del-tjue-y-la-ley-de-amnistia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oscar-puente-critica-el-tratamiento-mediatico-de-la-derecha-sobre-el-abogado-general-del-tjue-y-la-ley-de-amnistia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Junta de Andalucía publicó datos clínicos y personales de pacientes con demoras en el tratamiento de cáncer, generando preocupación sobre la protección de datos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia denuncia que la Junta de Andalucía mantuvo durante meses publicados en su web datos personales y clínicos de 23 pacientes con mieloma múltiple del Hospital Virgen del Rocío que esperaban la terapia CAR-T Carvykti.

Expertos citados en el artículo señalan que el problema no es solo la especie, sino el modelo de ordenación de tierras: la fragmentación normativa entre leyes forestales, de suelo y ambiental genera inseguridad jurídica y dificulta una planificación real. Además, la prórroga de la moratoria, con excepciones hasta 2030, facilita la plantación de eucalipto en áreas afectadas por la enfermedad de la banda marrón y la transferencia de derechos de plantación, lo que, según los entrevistados, equivale a crear un banco de derechos de la especie. Se destacan las consecuencias ecológicas: reducción de biodiversidad, pérdida de pastos y de usos agropecuarios, degradación de suelos y mayor vulnerabilidad a incendios.

El perro, con graves patologías, sufrió una caquexia severa, lo que llevó a los veterinarios a sacrificarlo para evitar más sufrimiento. El incidente pone de manifiesto la importancia de vigilar las condiciones de los animales de compañía y denunciar casos de maltrato.

Según la tradición, Santiago habría sido uno de los doce apóstoles de Jesús y el primero en morir mártir, decapitado en el año 44 d. C. por orden de Herodes Agripa I. Aunque no existen fuentes antiguas que confirmen su presencia en Hispania, a partir del siglo VI comenzaron a circular relatos que lo situaban predicando el cristianismo en regiones como Galicia, Asturias y Zaragoza, donde se dice que fundó una capilla en el lugar que hoy ocupa la Basílica del Pilar. La leyenda sostiene que, tras su muerte en Palestina, dos de sus discípulos trasladaron su cuerpo hasta Galicia en una barca de piedra, el llamado Arca Marmórica, y lo enterraron en el bosque de Libredón, con la ayuda de la mítica Reina Lupa, tras múltiples milagros. Ocho siglos después, hacia el año 823, un ermitaño llamado Pelayo habría visto unas luces celestes en ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-legendario-de-la-tumba-del-apostol-santiago-en-compostela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-legendario-de-la-tumba-del-apostol-santiago-en-compostela</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El IX Congreso de FEDE pide igualdad territorial y mejora en el acceso a tratamientos para personas con diabetes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El IX Congreso Nacional de la Federación Española de Diabetes (FEDE), celebrado en Barcelona bajo el lema 'Formación, bienestar y calidad de vida', ha reunido a más de 300 asistentes entre pacientes, familiares, profesionales sanitarios y representantes institucionales.

Este hito refleja un cambio profundo en el mapa global de la innovación, antes dominado por Estados Unidos, Europa y Japón. China presentó 1,8 millones de solicitudes, un 9 % más que el año anterior y tres veces más que Estados Unidos, que quedó en segundo lugar con algo más de 600.000. En conjunto, Asia concentró el 70 % de las solicitudes, destacando también India y Corea del Sur. Europa y América del Norte, en cambio, perdieron peso relativo. Además, China no solo registra patentes, sino que también las concede a gran velocidad: en 2024 otorgó más de un millón, triplicando a Estados Unidos. Actualmente, China acumula 5,7 millones de patentes activas, seguida de EE. UU. con 3,5 millones.

En una entrevista con el grupo editorial Axel Springer, Klichkó señaló que actualmente solo los jóvenes a partir de los 25 años son susceptibles de ser llamados a filas, pero sugirió que se podría bajar la edad a 22 o 23 años. A pesar de este planteamiento, Klichkó destacó que en tiempos pasados los jóvenes de 18 años servían en el Ejército, aunque los calificó de “niños”. Estas declaraciones surgen en un contexto de deserción y fuga masiva de ciudadanos ucranianos hacia el extranjero, lo que ha complicado la situación militar en el país. Además, se menciona que los propios hijos del alcalde viven y estudian fuera de Ucrania, lo que ha generado cierto contraste con sus propuestas.

Más Madrid denunció que la Consejería de Vivienda se negaba a entregar los datos relativos a las solicitudes, adjudicaciones y entregas de viviendas en San Sebastián de los Reyes, uno de los municipios pioneros del plan. La Consejería argumentó que la información estaba en manos de la empresa concesionaria y, por tanto, fuera del ámbito de la Ley de Transparencia. Sin embargo, el Consejo de Transparencia ha determinado que la Comunidad de Madrid tiene competencia para exigir y proporcionar esos datos a quien los solicite.

Se destaca el papel de Juan Carlos I y las reformas que llevaron a la proclamación de una monarquía parlamentaria, la consolidación de un estado de bienestar y la adhesión a la OTAN en 1982 y a la Unión Europea en 1986. A lo largo de las últimas décadas, España experimentó un notable crecimiento económico y un aumento de la productividad gracias a la liberalización iniciada en los 50 y a inversiones en turismo, inmigración y fondos comunitarios. Sin embargo, el artículo también señala tensiones contemporáneas, como la crisis financiera de 2008, la subida de movimientos nacionalistas y la fragmentación política, con el auge de formaciones como Podemos y Vox, y la gestión de la descentralización.

Este fenómeno se ha incrementado notablemente desde 2020, cuando el Gobierno andaluz de Juan Manuel Moreno eliminó el complemento de exclusividad, permitiendo que los facultativos públicos pudieran compatibilizar sus puestos con la actividad privada. Desde entonces, 3.544 médicos del SAS han obtenido autorización para trabajar también en el sector privado. El Ejecutivo andaluz defiende esta situación como parte de un modelo sanitario en el que la red privada complementa a la pública, pero la oposición denuncia que se trata de un proceso de privatización encubierta del sistema sanitario andaluz. La polémica se ha avivado con el nombramiento de Nicolás Navarro, subdirector de un hospital privado granadino y alto cargo del PP, como nuevo viceconsejero de Sanidad.

Según la investigación, hay un hotel en la Vila Joiosa gestionado por Elbim Hotel SL y Costa Jonense Gestion de Hoteles SL, con participación de la familia y un socio hispanorruso, que podría verse afectado por una disputa societaria y por demandas de disolución.

Los correos electrónicos filtrados y reportados por Drop Site News añaden peso a la hipótesis de que Epstein no solo facilitaba la explotación sexual y el acceso a elites políticas, sino que también era un intermediario clave en actividades de espionaje y ciberseguridad a favor de intereses israelíes. Koren, antiguo asistente del ex primer ministro y ministro de Defensa Ehud Barak —quien coordinó transferencias bancarias y entregas de paquetes a través de Epstein—, seguía vinculado a redes militares y de inteligencia mucho después de su retiro formal, sirviendo de enlace para reuniones con altos cargos estadounidenses y gestionando proyectos tecnológicos.

Consideró que el país atraviesa un periodo complicado, con un Gobierno debilitado, falta de presupuestos y enfrentamientos constantes con la justicia. Para él, la polarización y la pérdida de educación política son síntomas de un contexto dominado por el populismo.

Rajoy insistió en la necesidad de recuperar la moderación y el entendimiento entre fuerzas políticas sensatas, afirmando que España vive uno de los momentos más sombríos desde la aprobación de la Constitución de 1978.

Aunque el turismo sigue siendo un pilar fundamental de la economía nacional, representando más del 12% del PIB y cerca del 14% del empleo, los empresarios del sector afirman que los visitantes gastan cada vez menos en restaurantes y ocio. Este fenómeno no se limita a España: en Francia y otros países vecinos también se observa una tendencia similar. Cada vez hay más turistas que optan por comprar comida en supermercados o hacer picnics, en lugar de sentarse en terrazas o restaurantes tradicionales. En lugares como Saint-Jean-de-Luz, varios hosteleros reconocen haber tenido que modificar sus cartas, pasando de ofrecer platos sofisticados a opciones más simples y económicas.

El texto critica la reacción interna en Mozilla, que el autor interpreta como un ejemplo de cancelación ideológica impulsada por una parte de la comunidad progresista. Según su análisis, la fundación Mozilla se habría alejado de su misión inicial, adoptando una deriva “woke” y directivos con remuneraciones desproporcionadas a pesar de la caída en usuarios y en ingresos.

Esta teoría sostiene que el crecimiento económico surge cuando las innovaciones reemplazan tecnologías antiguas y empresas obsoletas, dinamizando la economía y permitiendo que nuevas empresas prosperen. La competencia, lejos de ser un obstáculo, es fundamental para impulsar la innovación, ya que obliga a las empresas a mejorar y a nuevos actores a entrar en el mercado.

Los investigadores reconstruyeron su perfil genético a partir de una muestra de tela manchada de sangre hallada en el sofá donde se suicidó en 1945. Según las conclusiones, la condición podría haber afectado su vida sexual y estar relacionada con un testículo no descendido, hecho ya sugerido por un examen médico de 1923. El estudio también desmiente los rumores de ascendencia judía, aunque detecta marcadores genéticos asociados con rasgos vinculados al autismo, la esquizofrenia y el trastorno bipolar.

En su intervención, también criticó la política migratoria, considerándola un 'error de cálculo', y afirmó que la inmigración no solo no contribuiría al sistema de pensiones, sino que sería un lastre para los servicios públicos como la sanidad, la educación y la vivienda. Además, denunció que la llegada masiva de inmigrantes pone en peligro la cohesión social y cultural de Cataluña, y advirtió que la sobrecarga de servicios podría conducir a su colapso.

El desbordamiento provocó daños y causó fallecimientos en Sot de Chera y otras zonas, con un balance de múltiples víctimas en la cuenca del Turia. El dossier presentado por el presidente en funciones Mazón ante las Corts sostiene que se activaron alertas en otros puntos (Magro, Poyo, Forata) y que Emergencias actuó conforme a protocolos, pero no hay mención explícita de Buseo en estos avisos iniciales. La jueza de la dana solicita información adicional a la Generalitat y cita a declarar a responsables técnicos.

Sin embargo, los resultados de las elecciones en Nueva Jersey y Virginia han mostrado un fuerte retroceso en el apoyo a los candidatos republicanos entre estos grupos. A pesar de los esfuerzos por construir una coalición multirracial de clase trabajadora, expertos como Michael Podhorzer señalan que esta estrategia de Trump estaba sobreestimada. El análisis sugiere que la falta de apoyo en 2025 se debe en gran parte a una reacción negativa hacia el actual presidente. Además, las elecciones en Nueva York muestran que los votantes más jóvenes y liberales siguen siendo la base del apoyo de figuras como Zohran Mamdani, quien ha ganado una significativa mayoría entre estos grupos, dejando atrás a votantes de clase trabajadora tradicional.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-perdida-de-apoyo-de-los-votantes-jovenes-y-minoritarios-hacia-trump-en-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-perdida-de-apoyo-de-los-votantes-jovenes-y-minoritarios-hacia-trump-en-2025</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 11:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aprobada la Ley de Servicios de Atención a la Clientela para reforzar los derechos de los consumidores]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Congreso de los Diputados ha dado luz verde a la Ley de Servicios de Atención a la Clientela, una normativa promovida por el Ministerio de Derechos Sociales, Consumo y Agenda 2030 que marca un antes y un después en la protección de los consumidores.

Entre las medidas principales destaca el fin de las llamadas comerciales no consentidas, conocidas como 'spam', ya que las empresas deberán identificarlas mediante un prefijo específico. Los contratos cerrados por este tipo de llamadas carecerán de validez.

Este cambio cierra un vacío legal existente desde la Ley Agrícola de 2018 que había permitido la venta de cannabinoides como el delta-8 o el delta-10 en gran parte del país. Según los nuevos límites, ningún producto podrá superar el 0,3 % de THC total ni contener más de 0,4 miligramos de THC por envase. Esto afectará directamente a gominolas, aceites, tinturas, bebidas o productos de vapeo con cualquier dosis superior. Además, se prohíben los cannabinoides sintéticos o procesados fuera de la planta, lo que implica el fin del mercado de productos de cáñamo psicoactivos tal y como se conoce.

Según Vega, los jóvenes reflejan las tensiones sociales e ideológicas de la sociedad adulta y, en particular, las actitudes egoístas y radicales que observan en sus padres. Aunque ha percibido en sus aulas una actitud de desconfianza hacia las figuras de autoridad, incluida la del docente, Vega también apunta que estos jóvenes, en su mayoría varones, son vulnerables y se sienten desilusionados por el sistema. A través de su experiencia en un instituto sevillano, Vega señala que los jóvenes no sólo repiten consignas sin cuestionarlas, sino que también tienden a rechazar la información basada en hechos, como el cambio climático.

Los mensajes revelan que Trump era consciente de la presencia de chicas jóvenes y víctimas de abuso en las propiedades de Epstein, según su propio testimonio, y que pasaron horas juntos en varias ocasiones. Además, hay mensajes donde Epstein agradece que Trump haya permanecido en silencio sobre los abusos ocurridos y donde lo califica como 'el peor individuo que ha conocido'.

Solo el 41% de los hospitales rurales ofrecen servicios de parto y maternidad, y en 12 estados menos de un tercio de estas instalaciones siguen prestando dichos servicios.

Aunque algunos grupos como los Verdes y los liberales la apoyan, el Partido Popular Europeo, incluido el PP español, se ha opuesto a este objetivo, argumentando que no es realista y que podría perjudicar la competitividad de la región.

La campaña estadounidense en el Caribe representa la mayor presencia militar desde la crisis de los misiles de Cuba, con el objetivo de mostrar fuerza y ganar apoyos internos en las elecciones de medio mandato de 2026. Trump vincula la lucha contra el narcotráfico y la inmigración irregular con amenazas para la seguridad nacional, justificando tanto la acción militar exterior como medidas restrictivas en territorio estadounidense. El despliegue militar responde también a intereses geopolíticos, redefiniendo la esfera de influencia estadounidense en América Latina frente a China y Rusia y buscando restablecer hegemonía regional, imponiendo presión sobre regímenes aliados como Cuba y Nicaragua.

Baby examina cómo España y otras democracias occidentales han abordado, o eludido, la criminalización de los crímenes franquistas, resaltando que la Ley de Amnistía de 1977 paralizó cualquier intento serio de judicialización. La autora subraya la importancia de una visión global y comparada, alejada del nacional-centrismo, para entender el caso español, y critica tanto el déficit de políticas educativas sobre el periodo franquista como la falta de implicación de los gobiernos democráticos en la construcción de una verdadera memoria histórica. Baby denuncia el blanqueamiento del franquismo entre las nuevas generaciones, que, debido a la ignorancia y ausencia de memoria, pueden romantizar el régimen y adoptar discursos revisionistas alimentados desde ámbitos familiares y redes sociales.

Aunque Microsoft 365 es compatible con Open Document Format (ODF), los usuarios siguen enfrentándose a problemas de visualización y edición debido a incompatibilidades. Esta falta de interoperabilidad no solo afecta la accesibilidad actual, sino que pone en peligro la legibilidad de los documentos en el futuro. LibreOffice, junto con otras suites de código abierto, defiende el uso de ODF, un estándar abierto e interoperable que garantiza la preservación de los documentos a lo largo del tiempo, sin depender de un único proveedor. La crítica se centra en que Microsoft no proporciona suficiente transparencia sobre su formato propietario, lo que vincula a los usuarios a sus productos y puede hacer que los documentos sean inaccesibles en el futuro. Además, ODF permite almacenar todos los recursos necesarios (fuentes, imágenes, etc.) dentro ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/libreoffice-denuncia-la-falta-de-interoperabilidad-de-los-formatos-de-microsoft-office-para-garantizar-la-accesibilidad-a-largo-plazo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/libreoffice-denuncia-la-falta-de-interoperabilidad-de-los-formatos-de-microsoft-office-para-garantizar-la-accesibilidad-a-largo-plazo</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 05:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La pareja más longeva casada comparte 83 años de vida en común]]></title><description><![CDATA[La historia de Lyle y Eleanor Gittens, una pareja estadounidense que se conoció a finales de la década de 1930 y se casó en 1942, ha sido certificada como la más longeva en la historia de matrimonios vivos por una combinación de edad conjunta de 216 años y 132 días. Ambos, hoy en la veintena de años de vida, superan registros anteriores y destacan por una relación marcada por la devoción y la correspondencia durante los años de servicio militar de Lyle en la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Eleanor recuerda cómo se conocieron en la Clark Atlanta University en 1941 y cómo él recibió un permiso de tres días para casarse, lo que les permitió celebrar su aniversario nupcial año tras año. Durante la guerra, ella dio a luz a su primer hijo y mantuvo el contacto con su marido a través de cartas, aunque estas quedaron parcialmente censuradas. Tras la contienda, la pareja se estableció en Nueva York, tuvo dos hijas y más tarde ambos pasaron a empleos gubernamentales.

Esta falta de trabajadores cualificados se debe a la creciente escasez de mano de obra en Estados Unidos, que afecta a sectores clave como la manufactura, la construcción y los oficios especializados. Jim Farley, CEO de Ford, advirtió que la crisis laboral podría tener consecuencias graves para la economía del país. Según Farley, el país no está invirtiendo adecuadamente en la formación profesional de la próxima generación de trabajadores, lo que podría generar problemas de autoabastecimiento en sectores estratégicos. Además, la falta de personal cualificado podría tener implicaciones incluso en la defensa nacional.

El avance de la enfermedad se ubica principalmente en Castilla y León, con el resto de focos repartidos por la Unión Europea, donde Alemania lidera en número de casos. El director general de Sanidad de la Producción Agroalimentaria y Bienestar Animal, Emilio García Muro, ha descrito la medida como un “toque de atención” para reforzar la bioseguridad y ha anunciado que las medidas podrían desescalarse progresivamente si el mapa epidemiológico mejora.

Partidarios de la propiedad pública sostienen que existen fundamentos históricos y legales para revertir la titularidad y proponen que el Ayuntamiento, con el respaldo de informes técnicos, podría emprender acciones judiciales para reclamar la titularidad para la ciudadanía. En 2018, una comisión de expertos encargada por el Ayuntamiento concluyó que la Iglesia no tiene ni puede tener título de propiedad sobre el inmueble y sugirió un modelo de gestión bajo un Patronato, relegando a la Iglesia a la rectoría del culto.

Este éxito se atribuye a factores como los lazos culturales y lingüísticos con América Latina, la flexibilización de políticas migratorias y la existencia de programas institucionales que facilitan la inserción social y laboral. A diferencia de otros países europeos más restrictivos, España ha optado por vías legales y acuerdos bilaterales con países latinoamericanos, promoviendo la regularización y la formación de los recién llegados.

A diferencia de las cadenas privadas, estos establecimientos priorizarían el bienestar social por encima del lucro, remunerando adecuadamente tanto a los trabajadores como a los campesinos locales.

El cómic utiliza dos mundos cromáticos –uno frío dentro de las residencias y otro cálido en el exterior– para reflejar la soledad, el miedo y la marginación que sufrieron tanto los mayores como las cuidadoras.

Los grupos que rechazaron la ILP fueron PNV, PSE-EE, PP y Vox, mientras EH Bildu y Sumar respaldaron la iniciativa. El objetivo de la ILP era modificar la legislación estatal para permitir a las comunidades autónomas establecer un Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI) aplicable en su territorio, posibilitando un SMI propio para Euskadi. Los defensores argumentaron que el salario mínimo vigente es insuficiente para salir de la pobreza y denunciaron bloqueo democrático; por su parte, los opositores adujeron riesgos de desincentivar el empleo y crear desigualdades interterritoriales. En el debate, se subrayó la necesidad de avanzar por la vía de la negociación colectiva y el diálogo social, sin imposiciones.

Este fenómeno ocurre en condiciones ambientales normales, sin necesidad de calor, presión o procesos industriales, lo que sugiere que ciertas plantas pueden actuar como “laboratorios químicos” biológicos. El mineral cristalizado se concentra en elementos clave para tecnologías modernas como cerio, lantano y neodimio, que son fundamentales para imanes, láseres y dispositivos ópticos, entre otros. Este hallazgo implica que ciertos hiperacumuladores vegetales pueden almacenar y organizar metales a concentraciones mucho mayores que las del suelo, abriendo la posibilidad de obtener tierras raras sin minería intensiva. Además, se plantea un modelo circular sostenible: cultivar plantas en suelos metalizados para extraer minerales y, al mismo tiempo, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-helecho-produce-tierras-raras-sin-mineria-revolucion-o-prototipo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-helecho-produce-tierras-raras-sin-mineria-revolucion-o-prototipo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Batida neonazi en la Complutense: el campus resiste la provocación de Vito Quiles]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe un acto organizado por el agitador de extrema derecha Vito Quiles en el campus Somosaguas de la Universidad Complutense que recibió una respuesta contundente por parte de la comunidad universitaria. Aunque Quiles logró reunir a un reducido grupo de seguidores, estimado en alrededor de 200, la protesta organizada por estudiantes, docentes y trabajadores superó ampliamente esa cifra y ejerció presión para impedir la realización de discursos de odio. Tras el pinchazo, un pequeño grupo neonazi, identificado como adherentes a Quiles, ingresó en la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas y Sociología, hostigando a estudiantes y docentes, dañando propiedad y intentando forzar la entrada a zonas protegidas. Durante el incidente, se arrancaron pancartas, se rayó una esvástica y se interrumpió una clase de máster; sin embargo, el personal docente y el alumnado lograron expulsar a los agresores con la ayuda de la seguridad y de un despliegue policial.

Rosa Álvarez y Toñi García subrayaron que las puertas de las instituciones europeas se abren con frecuencia, mientras que en las Corts, según ellas, “se las han cerrado” a las víctimas.

Esta medida, que inicialmente estaba prevista para 2028, se adelantará a 2026, con el objetivo de frenar el colapso de las aduanas debido a la exención de aranceles que se había convertido en un coladero. Cada año, Europa recibe millones de paquetes de bajo valor sin impuestos, lo que perjudica a las empresas locales. El 65% de estos paquetes tienen precios artificialmente bajos para evitar los aranceles. Además de la moda, otros sectores como el juguetero también se han visto afectados. El acuerdo también implica que la UE abrirá un centro de datos aduaneros para facilitar el intercambio de información entre los países miembros y asegurar que se paguen los impuestos correspondientes.

Ayuso defendió una inmigración “ordenada” y ligada al trabajo, subrayando que las fronteras deben mantenerse en orden y recordando que esas competencias no corresponden a la Comunidad de Madrid. Frente a las críticas de la portavoz de Vox, quien tildó la propuesta de “cosmopaleta” por favorecer que lleguen más personas, Ayuso enfatizó que las personas se desplazan hacia donde existen oportunidades y advirtió contra un “efecto expulsión”. Además, acusó a Vox de ofender a los hispanos y recalcó su objetivo de convertir Madrid en un lugar próspero con oportunidades libres para trabajar.

Este ataque se suma a una serie de acciones violentas por parte de colonos israelíes, que en octubre de 2025 protagonizaron más de 260 incidentes en Cisjordania, alcanzando una cifra récord.

Su muerte supuso un punto de inflexión en la conciencia social española sobre el racismo y la xenofobia. Desde hace más de tres décadas, su memoria se recuerda cada 13 de noviembre, especialmente en el distrito de Moncloa-Aravaca, donde ocurrieron los hechos. Sin embargo, en 2025, el Ayuntamiento de Madrid, liderado por Almeida, ha optado por no apoyar la propuesta de Más Madrid para renovar el tributo institucional.

Este comportamiento eleva el ritmo de crecimiento de las emisiones respecto a 2023 y supera la línea roja de los objetivos de 1,5°C. El estudio alerta que el presupuesto restante de carbono para mantener el calentamiento bajo 1,5°C podría agotarse antes de 2030 si las tendencias actuales continúan.

En Greenland, Alaska, Siberia y Canadá, se utilizaban intestinos de mamíferos como fibra clave para crear tejidos ligeros y resistentes al agua. La estructura natural de los intestinos permitía que una cara repelerá la lluvia y la otra facilitara la evaporación del sudor, gracias a microperforaciones que bloqueaban el agua pero dejaban pasar la humedad. El proceso incluía limpiar, inflar y secar los intestinos, cortarlos en tiras y unirlas con costuras especiales para lograr un tejido impermeable. Aunque la prenda resultaba extremadamente liviana, con ejemplos que pesan apenas 85 gramos, su valor residía en la protección que ofrecía en condiciones árticas extremas, especialmente para cazadores que viajaban en kayaks.

Esta sanción pone de manifiesto la responsabilidad de las redes sociales en el control de la publicidad que circula en ellas, especialmente cuando se trata de fraudes financieros.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cnmv-impone-una-multa-millonaria-a-twitter-por-anuncios-fraudulentos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cnmv-impone-una-multa-millonaria-a-twitter-por-anuncios-fraudulentos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 11:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El fiscal general defiende su inocencia en juicio y niega la filtración del correo con la confesión de González Amador]]></title><description><![CDATA[Álvaro García Ortiz, fiscal general del Estado, ha ofrecido su alegato de inocencia en el juicio que enfrenta tras ser acusado de filtrar un correo con la confesión de Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso. García Ortiz negó tajantemente ser el responsable de la filtración y se mostró firme al rechazar las acusaciones, argumentando que no envió el correo a personas ajenas a la Fiscalía. Durante su intervención, destacó el papel de Isabel Díaz Ayuso en la publicación de un tuit que ponía en cuestión la honorabilidad de varios fiscales, y criticó al entorno de la presidenta madrileña por utilizar el correo filtrado con fines políticos. Además, García Ortiz abordó la polémica sobre la filtración de la información, tachando de calumnia los intentos de vincular a la Fiscalía con la filtración. El fiscal general también defendió su actuación en relación a la gestión de los correos y su responsabilidad con los datos de terceros, aclarando que el borrado ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-general-defiende-su-inocencia-en-juicio-y-niega-la-filtracion-del-correo-con-la-confesion-de-gonzalez-amador</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-general-defiende-su-inocencia-en-juicio-y-niega-la-filtracion-del-correo-con-la-confesion-de-gonzalez-amador</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 11:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Juez federal ordena la liberación de más de 600 detenidos en redada migratoria en Illinois]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un juez federal en Illinois ha ordenado la liberación de más de 600 personas detenidas en el marco de la 'Operación Midway Blitz', una ofensiva contra la inmigración implementada por el gobierno de Trump. El juez Jeffrey Cummings falló a favor de los abogados del National Immigration Justice Center y la ACLU, quienes alegaron que las detenciones, realizadas entre junio y octubre de 2025, violaron acuerdos previos sobre arrestos sin orden judicial. Los arrestos afectaron a personas que no representaban una amenaza significativa, por lo que el juez determinó que debían recibir fianza antes del 21 de noviembre. Esta decisión llega en medio de una creciente tensión en Chicago y otras ciudades donde se cuestionan las políticas de inmigración del gobierno, acusando violaciones de derechos constitucionales. En respuesta, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ha criticado el fallo, argumentando que pone en peligro la seguridad de los estadounidenses. A pesar de la controversia, muchos abogados]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juez-federal-ordena-la-liberacion-de-mas-de-600-detenidos-en-redada-migratoria-en-illinois</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juez-federal-ordena-la-liberacion-de-mas-de-600-detenidos-en-redada-migratoria-en-illinois</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 11:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El fiscal general defiende su inocencia en el juicio por la filtración del correo de la pareja de Ayuso]]></title><description><![CDATA[El juicio al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, ha llegado a su fase final tras varios días de testimonios y acusaciones sobre la presunta filtración de un correo confidencial de Alberto González Amador, pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso. La acusación sostiene que García Ortiz filtró el correo que contenía la confesión del empresario sobre delitos fiscales, mientras que la defensa argumenta que no existe prueba alguna que lo vincule con la filtración y que la investigación fue sesgada. El fiscal general se ha declarado inocente y ha explicado que su única intención fue defender a los fiscales y a la institución ante las acusaciones del entorno de Ayuso. Los testimonios de la Guardia Civil, en particular de la UCO, señalan a García Ortiz como responsable de la filtración, pero los abogados del fiscal han refutado estas acusaciones, alegando que no hay pruebas directas. El juicio se cierra con las alegaciones finales, donde las acusaciones piden una condena de hasta seis años de p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-general-defiende-su-inocencia-en-el-juicio-por-la-filtracion-del-correo-de-la-pareja-de-ayuso</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-general-defiende-su-inocencia-en-el-juicio-por-la-filtracion-del-correo-de-la-pareja-de-ayuso</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crecimiento de ventas en la moda, pero condiciones laborales precarias para sus trabajadores]]></title><description><![CDATA[A pesar de que el mundo de la moda, en especial marcas como Inditex y Mango, está alcanzando récords históricos de ventas, la situación de los trabajadores de este sector es alarmante. Según un informe de la Berlin School of Business and Innovation, la gran mayoría de los empleados de las principales multinacionales de moda, como Zara y Mango, no reciben salarios suficientes para cubrir sus necesidades básicas. El estudio revela que entre el 70% y 80% de la plantilla de Inditex, por ejemplo, no puede vivir con el sueldo que recibe, a pesar de que la compañía paga por encima de lo estipulado en los convenios colectivos. La mayoría de estos empleados tiene contratos a tiempo parcial y horarios irregulares, lo que agrava su situación económica. Además, el modelo de ‘fast fashion’, que prioriza la producción rápida y a bajo costo, es uno de los principales responsables de esta precarización laboral. Aunque las grandes marcas de moda han anunciado compromisos públicos para mejorar las condi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/crecimiento-de-ventas-en-la-moda-pero-condiciones-laborales-precarias-para-sus-trabajadores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/crecimiento-de-ventas-en-la-moda-pero-condiciones-laborales-precarias-para-sus-trabajadores</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
