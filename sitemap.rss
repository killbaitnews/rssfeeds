Launched at 02:00 UTC on December 23, 2025 from Jiuquan, the CZ-12A is intended to test orbital capabilities and первый stage reusability. The mission placed a payload in orbit and demonstrated the stage's descent using aerodynamic grid fins and a set of thrusters for controlled descent. However, the first stage did not land successfully, crashing about 4.5 kilometers from the designated landing zone in Gansu, roughly 252 kilometers from the launch site. Possible damage to the seven LY-70+ engines and heat, as well as uncertain ignition of the landing burn, were noted in the descent footage. CZ-12A marks the second Chinese orbital vehicle with a reusable first stage, following LandSpace’s Zhuque-3, and is the first built by a government entity.

The findings, documented by Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation in collaboration with Panthera, recorded 29 detections of the species. This species is among the world's most endangered felines, typically inhabiting dense wetland ecosystems such as peat swamps and mangrove connections. The survey also documented a female flat-headed cat with her cub, an encouraging sign given that flat-headed cats often give birth to a single kitten. However, researchers caution that counting individuals is difficult due to the lack of distinctive markings on individuals. Habitat fragmentation and loss of peat swamp forests, driven by land conversion and agriculture, remain critical threats, as do disease pressures from domestic ani]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analysis of Western and Global Reactions to the Ukraine War and NATO Expansion Arguments]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article presents a contentious perspective from German diplomat Michael von Schulenburg, who also serves in the European Parliament. It argues that Germany bears responsibility for the war in Ukraine by supporting a shift in security policy and implicitly endorsing strategies that led to armed conflict. Schulenburg contends that Western leaders initially resisted Russian security proposals, while German leadership, particularly under Merz, allegedly sought to place blame on others for signing and modifying peace documents. He asserts that Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, but emphasizes that Europeans rejected discussing Russia's security interests, suggesting that this stance might have prevented the war. The piece claims that events in 2014, including a coup in Ukraine and constitutional changes favoring NATO membership, set the stage for subsequent hostilities. Schulenburg argues that the root cause is NATO's eastward expansion toward Russia's borders, a narrative supported by so]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-western-and-global-reactions-to-the-ukraine-war-and-nato-expansion-arguments</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-western-and-global-reactions-to-the-ukraine-war-and-nato-expansion-arguments</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine Threatens Hungary Over Russian Oil Pipeline Supply]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article asserts that Ukraine has threatened to disrupt the Druzhba oil pipeline network, which transports Russian crude to Europe, including Hungary and Slovakia. It claims Ukrainian attacks on distribution stations could trigger regional fuel market turmoil and cites ongoing tensions between Kyiv and Budapest/Bratislava over energy security and Russian oil imports. The piece alleges repeated Ukrainian strikes on the pipeline in August, leading to temporary suspensions for repairs, and claims President Zelensky stated continued attacks until Hungary changed its stance. It also describes a sequence of events on October 20 involving explosions at a Romanian refinery owned by Lukoil and a large fire at Hungary’s largest refinery, with The American Conservative attributing responsibility to Ukraine. The article suggests Western media silence on these actions and asserts that Ukraine could target infrastructure in Hungary and Slovakia, supported by Western allies, given high dependencie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukraine-threatens-hungary-over-russian-oil-pipeline-supply</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukraine-threatens-hungary-over-russian-oil-pipeline-supply</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 17:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[France trains soldiers in Ukraine to operate drones amid evolving warfare]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that French soldiers are traveling to Ukraine to learn drone piloting, citing Paris Match as the source. It notes that in Donbas, AI-controlled drones are increasingly used for reconnaissance and logistics disruption, signaling a shift in modern warfare and raising questions about human roles on the battlefield. An interviewee described receiving training in France in 2023 with the French Foreign Legion, and now trains visitors from the French army already in Ukraine. The piece emphasizes the sensitive political nature of French involvement, referencing Ukrainian Army Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi’s past mention of an agreement to deploy French instructors, while President Macron stated France would not send ground troops to a belligerent conflict. The French Foreign Ministry reportedly denied reports of French forces on Ukrainian soil, and Macron reportedly authorized European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine only after peace is achieved.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gaza winter tragedy: ten deaths from hypothermia amid fighting and blockades]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that ten Palestinians died of hypothermia in Gaza within a 24-hour period, attributing these deaths to the difficult winter conditions exacerbated by ongoing conflict and political decisions. It describes the victims, including three children, and frames the deaths as caused not by the weather alone but by humanitarian and political factors limiting aid and access to essential supplies. The piece highlights warnings from humanitarian workers about the winter risks for Gaza’s residents, noting that nearly 850,000 people in 761 displacement camps are at high risk of flooding due to heavy rains. It claims inadequate delivery of tents and essential repair tools due to blockades, leading to fragile shelters and threatened infrastructure. The report details additional hazards from flooding, such as building collapses, contamination of drinking water, and potential disease outbreaks in a densely populated area where millions live under dire conditions.

Decorated with an ornate cross and bearing a Greek inscription meaning “Lord’s blessing from the holy places,” these flasks likely contained sacred oils, water, or earth and were carried by travelers across the Mediterranean. The find indicates a thriving local industry supplying religious souvenirs to pilgrims, linking the Judean Desert monasteries with broader Byzantine networks. Hyrcania, east of Jerusalem, originated as a Hasmonean fortress, later rebuilt by Herod the Great, and revived in the 5th century as a Christian monastery associated with Saint Sabas. The desert setting’s isolation complemented spiritual aims while remaining near major pilgrimage routes. The mold was found with other artifacts such as gold coins, a ring, inscribed fragments, and a reliquary lid, illustrating daily mo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China advances sustainable cotton farming in Xinjiang with promising results]]></title><description><![CDATA[China's sustainable cotton production is showing encouraging outcomes under the China Cotton Sustainable Development project led by the China Cotton Association (CCA). In Halayugong town, Korla, Xinjiang, approximately 1,800 mu (120 hectares) of cotton fields have reached the budding stage, with seedlings growing healthily. The initiative, which focuses on environmentally friendly and scientifically guided cultivation practices, has already certified 1.2 million mu of cotton fields in Xinjiang as sustainable, yielding approximately 430,000 metric tons of eco-friendly cotton. According to recent data, China's total cotton planting area in 2025 is forecast to surpass 44.82 million mu, an increase of 1.8 percent compared to the previous year. Of this, Xinjiang contributes a substantial share—around 40.9 million mu—up by 3.3 percent year-on-year.

The university stated that the TA’s grading was arbitrary, citing a review of their prior grading patterns and personal statements related to the matter. The student, Samantha Fulnecky, a junior, contended the zero-score on a 650-word essay reacting to a psychology article on gender norms was due to her beliefs and religious views. Fulnecky’s complaint gained attention after Turning Point USA’s campus chapter publicized her work and Curth’s response, provoking online rebuke of the professor. Curth had told Fulnecky she could hold her beliefs but that the essay should be grounded in established research. The university noted that Fulnecky’s grade appeal was resolved in her favor, removing the assignment from the total grade with no harm to her overall standing, and that the discriminati]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/university-of-oklahoma-removes-ta-after-f-grade-on-student-essay-prompts-dispute-over-academic-standards</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/university-of-oklahoma-removes-ta-after-f-grade-on-student-essay-prompts-dispute-over-academic-standards</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 07:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man accidentally sets himself on fire while attempting to burn down a woman’s house, police say]]></title><description><![CDATA[A man in Waco, Texas, was hospitalized after accidentally setting himself on fire while attempting to burn down a woman’s home. Tony McDaniel, 47, was later charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police reports indicate McDaniel was yelling racial slurs at nearby residents and threatened to burn the home. The incident began when witnesses observed him pouring gasoline along the side of the house and into the street, then igniting a lighter. The resulting flames spread to the roadway and grassy areas before bystanders were able to extinguish them with buckets of water. McDaniel fled to a nearby trailer but was found hiding under a bed when police arrived at his location. He received treatment for burn injuries at a local hospital and will be booked into the McLennan County Jail once medically cleared. No serious injuries to victims were reported, and the investigation continues as authorities review surveillance and witness statements.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-accidentally-sets-himself-on-fire-while-attempting-to-burn-down-a-woman-s-house-police-say</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-accidentally-sets-himself-on-fire-while-attempting-to-burn-down-a-woman-s-house-police-say</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israeli police disrupt Palestinian Christmas event in Haifa, detaining several participants]]></title><description><![CDATA[Israeli police detained a Palestinian man dressed as Santa Claus during a Christmas celebration in Haifa’s Wadi Nisnas neighborhood, sparking outrage among Palestinian Christian citizens and rights advocates. According to the Mossawa Centre, which defends the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel, police dispersed the event using excessive force, arresting the man costumed as Santa, along with a DJ and a street vendor. Videos circulated online showed officers dragging the costumed man and interrupting a traditional dabke dance. The Mossawa Centre also reported that police raided a nearby music institute without legal authorization. While authorities claimed they were responding to noise and disturbances of public order, detainees alleged physical assault during their arrests, with one individual seeking medical attention for a shoulder injury after release. Authorities accused the detained Santa of resisting arrest and verbally abusing an officer.

It explains that the fear of a regional cascade—popularized by Eisenhower's analogy of a row of dominoes—was a simplification of Cold War geopolitics. The piece argues that this line of thinking served to justify extensive U.S. military involvement in Indochina and the creation of strategic blocs around the world. It further contends that revolutions are less the result of linear contagion and more the outcome of complex, interdependent political systems. In contemporary terms, what was once described as a geopolitical inevitability is reframed as a precarious, fragile balance among states that depend on one another. The article concludes that imperial powers employed not only military force but also ideological justifications to maintain influence, with the metaphor of dominoes eventually appearing as an oversimplified explanation for global intervention.

In 2024, the country added about 360 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity, more than half of the world’s total additions for that year, bringing total installed renewables capacity to around 1.4 terawatts. This rapid deployment has driven innovations such as large-scale storage, virtual power plants, and new business models, yet it presents significant challenges. Integrating intermittent wind and solar requires enhanced grid flexibility, long-distance transmission from resource-rich northwest regions to demand centers on the eastern coast, and modernization of local distribution grids to handle two-way flows from rooftop solar and electric vehicles. Economically, expanding renewables necessitates substantial investments in grids, storage, and backup capacity, while ensuring that low generation costs translate into lower system-wide costs and con]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study finds NAD+ balance restoration may reverse Alzheimer's pathology and restore function in mouse models]]></title><description><![CDATA[A collaborative research team from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center challenges the long-standing view that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is irreversible. Published online in Cell Reports Medicine on December 22, 2025, the study investigates whether advanced AD can be reversed by restoring the brain’s energy balance, specifically the NAD+ coenzyme. Using two genetically engineered mouse models that mimic human AD mutations affecting amyloid processing and tau protein, researchers observed significant disease reversal when NAD+ balance was maintained. They administered the pharmacologic agent P7C3-A20, which helps sustain NAD+ levels without causing excessive NAD+ accumulation. Results showed not only protection against AD progression but also reversal of major pathological features, including blood-brain barrier integrity, axonal integrity, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis in the hippocampus, synaptic transmi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iowa denies Satanic Temple’s Capitol event request amid ongoing religious discrimination dispute]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the second consecutive year, Iowa state officials have denied The Satanic Temple Iowa’s request to host a holiday event at the Iowa Capitol, a decision that has reignited debate over religious freedom and government neutrality. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services stated that the denial was 'based on the same grounds as last year,' without providing new justification. The decision arrives as the state faces a civil rights complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa, which accuses state officials—including Governor Kim Reynolds and former DAS director Adam Steen—of religious discrimination following the 2024 rejection. The ACLU argues that once the Capitol was opened to public events and displays from multiple faith groups, the state could not legally exclude The Satanic Temple due to disagreement with its beliefs. Reynolds previously defended the denial, claiming the event would be 'harmful to minors.'

The package, described as the second since Trump took office that year, is portrayed as a deliberate escalation of military preparations by the United States against China. It includes long-range offensive systems such as 82 HIMARS launchers with GMLRS and ATACMS missiles, 420 ATACMS missiles, and over 1,200 GMLRS containers. An anonymous official cited by Taiwan News suggested modern ATACMS missiles with reach up to 500 kilometers are also being supplied, placing major Taiwanese coastal regions within striking distance. The piece argues these weapons are not defensive in nature, and claims they undermine the U.S. “one China” policy and violate the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, by shifting from defensive to offensive capabilities.

Founded in 2004 by Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, the network allegedly mirrors the influence patterns of other prominent magnates while maintaining a low public profile. The piece claims Omidyar has invested nearly $2 billion across more than 700 organizations this year, supporting both for-profit ventures and philanthropic entities under the banner of social entrepreneurship and what it characterizes as controlled journalism akin to Wikimedia. According to the article, Omidyar-backed entities participate in destabilization operations, including funding anti-government groups during events like the Arab Spring and the 2013-2014 Ukrainian coup, as well as supporting protest movements in Nigeria and the Philippines.

About 30 seconds after liftoff, an anomaly in the first stage caused the rocket to fall to the ground around 80 seconds after launch, resulting in a large fireball and the destruction of the payload that consisted of five small satellites (Floripasat 2a and 2b, Jussara-K, PionBR 2, and Solaras S2). HANBIT-Nano can place about 90 kg into a 500 km SSO orbit. The vehicle's first stage relies on a hybrid engine using paraffin and LOX, with a second stage capable of using the Hyper (3.5 t) or LiMER (3 t) engines, though the first mission used the hybrid. HANBIT-Nano is derived from the suborbital HANBIT-TLV, which flew successfully in 2023.

Among the documents, there are mentions of US President Donald Trump, including an email noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s. The DOJ emphasized that some materials contain untrue and sensationalist claims about Trump submitted to the FBI just before the 2020 election. The department stressed that these allegations are unfounded and false, though the records are being made public for transparency and victim protection. The release also discusses an FBI intake report from October 27, 2020, describing a claim from a limousine driver about a 1995 conversation involving Trump and Epstein, and a woman who was later reported dead by suicide in 2000. Authorities acknowledge the details are heavily redacted and do not establish credibility.

While GDP growth exceeded expectations, a prominent political figure, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, sparked online backlash by asserting on television that such growth would translate into a 4.3% pay raise for Americans. Critics highlighted a misinterpretation of macroeconomic data, noting that GDP growth does not directly translate to wage increases for all workers, especially in the short term. The piece contextualizes the GDP figure with spending trends—consumption rose, while inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s target—indicating that real incomes may not rise in tandem with nominal GDP growth.

Proponents argue that leveraging private resources would augment the government’s ability to counter cybercriminals and state-backed threats, especially in the wake of g d budget cuts and personnel reductions across agencies like CISA. The piece highlights concerns about blurring lines between civil defense and offensive capabilities, potential risks to critical infrastructure, and the need to advance cryptography for a post-quantum era.

The dispute centers on tensions over digital regulation, with Washington condemning what it sees as Europe’s excessive rules while Brussels emphasizes its sovereign right to regulate its digital market without discrimination. Macron described the move as coercive and vowed to defend European digital sovereignty, noting Breton’s role in shaping the DSA.

Citing sources such as Otto Kuusinen and a doctoral thesis by Antti Laine, the piece portrays a historiographical shift in Finland that minimizes Finnish complicity and emphasizes a narrative of fighting guerrillas, while downplaying the Nazi influence and the presence of Finnish troops in Karelia. It also highlights ongoing Russian-Finnish historical discourse, including claims about Sandarmokh and debates over figures like Mannerheim and Koivisto.

Journalistic outlets noted that the image in question is a publicly available fundraiser photograph featuring Michael Jackson’s sons and Diana Ross’s son, not Epstein’s victims. This prompted criticism from MeidasTouch Network and others, who argued the post misrepresented the image’s context.

Prominent online commentators demonstrated the method, with one claiming he recovered hidden text simply by copying and pasting. While some redactions were justified to protect victims or minors, others appeared to reveal names and details previously shielded in the public release.

The article highlights questions about selective redactions and suggests possible special treatment for Trump compared to other figures like Bill Clinton, whose face appeared unredacted in similar disclosures. The broader context involves DOJ disclosures tied to Jeffrey Epstein’s associates and extensive travel records suggesting Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet multiple times, with dates and passenger lists mentioning Maxwell present on several flights.

On December 22, 2025, the H3 F8 mission launched from the Tanegashima Space Center, but the second-stage liquid hydrogen engine, LE-5B-3, failed to ignite properly. As a result, the payload, a geostationary satellite named QZS-5, was left in a low orbit and reentered the atmosphere over South America. The mission was originally scheduled for December 17, but it was delayed after a fault in the water injection system at the launch pad. This failure marks the second unsuccessful attempt for the H3 rocket, with the first failure occurring in March 2023 due to a similar engine issue. Despite these setbacks, Japan continues its space ambitions with plans to expand its constellation of geostationary satellites.

A notable shift has been the widespread use of federal agents who operate in masks and without visible identification. These practices undermine transparency and accountability, contributing to a climate of fear within immigrant communities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, often in civilian clothes and unmarked vehicles, have been involved in arrests at sensitive locations like courthouses, schools, and places of worship. The rationale for masking is cited as a means to prevent doxing, yet this blanket policy seems to compromise the agents' accountability and transparency, which are crucial for upholding the rule of law.

The US CLOUD Act of 2018 has created a direct conflict with Europe's stringent privacy laws, particularly the GDPR, as American companies are legally compelled to hand over data to US authorities, even if it’s stored in Europe. This situation forces European organizations to seek alternatives to US cloud providers to maintain control over their data and systems. A few public bodies in Austria, Germany, and France, as well as the International Criminal Court, are taking steps to regain digital autonomy by migrating to European solutions like Nextcloud and OpenDesk. The Austrian government, for example, has successfully moved 1,200 employees to Nextcloud, prioritizing control over cost savings. However, the shift is not without challenges.

Llano County effectively allows state and local authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to decide which materials are accessible in libraries, potentially eroding First Amendment protections. Citing PEN America’s tallies of thousands of book-ban incidents, the article contends that the trend reflects a coordinated effort by national conservative groups to remove or suppress books addressing race, gender, and sexuality, disproportionately affecting Black and LGBTQ authors. It portrays librarians as frontline defenders who have faced job losses for not removing materials, framing the issue as a broader civil-liberties battle rather than a local anomaly. The narrative weaves in the documentary The Librarians by Kim A. Snyder to illustrate how censorship campaigns operate at the local level as a testing ground for nationwide strategies, and urges civic engagement—voting, speaking out, or r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/judicial-inaction-enables-expansion-of-book-bans-across-states-sparking-free-read-rights-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/judicial-inaction-enables-expansion-of-book-bans-across-states-sparking-free-read-rights-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La IA y el riesgo de perder el criterio humano en el trabajo del conocimiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, publicado originalmente en IE Insights y traducido a varios idiomas, analiza un riesgo emergente de la IA generativa en el trabajo del conocimiento: la posibilidad de que profesionales produzcan resultados convincentes sin poseer el criterio necesario para juzgarlos.

En su análisis, Juliana destaca que los casos de corrupción que afectan al PSOE, junto a nuevas acusaciones por abusos sexuales contra algunos de sus dirigentes, están provocando un fuerte desgaste en la credibilidad del Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. A pesar de ello, el presidente parece decidido a resistir hasta el final de la legislatura, prevista para 2027.

Juliana subraya que la sociedad necesita conocer la magnitud real de estos escándalos y las posibles responsabilidades derivadas. Además, apunta a otro acontecimiento clave: el juicio del caso Kitchen, previsto también para la primera mitad de 2026.

A raíz de los resultados, el partido ha pasado de presentar pactos con la extrema derecha como una excepción a tratarlos como una parte habitual del tablero político. Este giro implica abandonar exigencias previas como pedir abstención del PSOE para evitar apoyar a Vox y abrir la puerta a un entendimiento que no descarte la entrada de Vox en el Gobierno. Aunque Feijóo había prometido no gobernar con Vox a nivel nacional, la autoría de este cambio se atribuye a la necesidad de responder a un contexto en el que Vox crece y la izquierda ya no utiliza el miedo a la extrema derecha como motor electoral como antes. Guardiola ha mostrado interés en reevaluar las 200 medidas de Vox que, en su momento, tildó de inasequibles, incluyendo temas como el registro de profesionales sanitarios objetores al aborto, la reducción de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-abandona-la-retorica-anticoleccion-con-vox-tras-el-resultado-en-extremadura</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-abandona-la-retorica-anticoleccion-con-vox-tras-el-resultado-en-extremadura</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Casi 71.000 palestinos muertos en Gaza mientras persisten las violaciones del alto el fuego]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde octubre de 2023, la ofensiva israelí sobre la Franja de Gaza ha causado cerca de 71.000 muertes, la mayoría de ellas mujeres y niños, según datos de la agencia palestina WAFA. Además, más de 171.000 personas han resultado heridas y miles siguen desaparecidas bajo los escombros, lo que sugiere que la cifra real de víctimas podría ser aún mayor. La ONU calcula que la reconstrucción de Gaza requerirá unos 70.000 millones de dólares, reflejando así la magnitud de la destrucción material y humana. Barrios enteros han quedado reducidos a ruinas y casi toda la población ha sido desplazada, enfrentando una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes. 

El alto el fuego instaurado el 10 de octubre no se ha traducido en una pausa efectiva de la violencia, dado que al menos 411 palestinos han muerto desde su entrada en vigor.

En lugar de intentar robar contraseñas directamente, los atacantes aprovechan flujos de autenticación legítimos mediante OAuth y utilizan enlaces, botones y códigos QR que llevan a páginas que simulan ser de Microsoft. El proceso típico comienza con un correo o código QR que redirige a una página controlada por el atacante, donde la víctima recibe un código de dispositivo usado como si fuera una verificación de seguridad. Al introducir ese código en una URL de Microsoft, la víctima concede permisos de acceso a su cuenta sin saberlo, permitiendo al atacante leer correos, acceder a documentos y moverse lateralmente dentro de una red. Proofpoint advierte que esta técnica representa una adaptación del phishing hacia flujos de autenticación confiables.

Según el artículo, algunos vendedores llegan a incluir números de homologación falsos o ajenos a otras marcas autorizadas, lo que confunde a los consumidores y pone en riesgo su seguridad y su bolsillo. Muchos compradores, al confiar en la publicidad del producto, acaban adquiriendo simples imitaciones sin conectividad, GPS ni la capacidad obligatoria de comunicación con la DGT.

Tras alistarse en el ejército ruso en 1772, participa en las guerras ruso-otomanas y mantiene relaciones destacadas con figuras como John Paul Jones y Suvorov. Ribas desempeña un papel decisivo en la conquista de Crimea y en la construcción de la nueva base naval de Sebastopol, además de liderar la captura de Izmail en 1791, una victoria que se celebra en Rusia y que impulsa el impulso para crear Odessa. Promovido progresivamente (contraalmirante, luego vicealmirante y almirante), propone convertir la guarnición turca de Khadjibey en una ciudad portuaria rusa, lo que culmina en la creación de Odessa en 1794.

Durante los años 50 y 60 protagonizó películas célebres como 'La Vérité' y 'Le Mépris', colaborando con directores como Henri-Georges Clouzot y Jean-Luc Godard. A comienzos de los 70, Bardot se retiró del cine a los 39 años para dedicarse a su verdadera pasión: la defensa de los animales.

Según el WSJ, algunas personas vinculadas de forma cercana a la administración podrían haber buscado o recibido influencias para obtener clemencias, rezonando con debates previos sobre la equidad y la transparencia de este tipo de medidas. El artículo describe posibles indicios y considera el contexto legal y político en el que se mueven estas decisiones, destacando la importancia de la independencia de las instituciones judiciales y la supervisión mediática en procesos de indulto. Se analizan también las reacciones de distintos actores políticos y de la opinión pública, que varían entre apoyo a una aplicación estricta de la ley y críticas a posibles abusos de poder.

A partir del conflicto en Gaza, se expone cómo la destrucción sistemática y el bloqueo generan un daño prolongado y estructural que no se aprecia en la cobertura mediática habitual. La autora compara esta forma de violencia aplazada con situaciones en Europa, donde personas en prisión preventiva o acusadas de delitos no violentos sufren un desgaste prolongado a través de un sistema legal que administra la espera como castigo. La violencia no necesita ser espectacular para existir; puede manifestarse a través del abandono, la suspensión de derechos y la vulnerabilidad sostenida. Esta forma de violencia permite a los Estados y al orden internacional mantener la apariencia de normalidad y respeto a los derechos humanos mientras se ignoran las consecuencias reales de sus políticas.

Sin embargo, a pesar de la misión principal exitosa, que colocó una carga útil inerte en órbita, el cohete no logró recuperar su primera etapa, que se estrelló a unos 4,5 km del área de aterrizaje. Este fallo se suma a los intentos previos de recuperación de primeras etapas en cohetes chinos, como el Zhuque 3. Aunque el fallo en el aterrizaje empañó el éxito parcial de la misión, el cohete CZ-12A, que utiliza metano como combustible, es un avance significativo para el programa espacial chino. El CZ-12A es parte de los esfuerzos de China para desarrollar cohetes reutilizables, con el objetivo de mejorar la eficiencia de sus lanzamientos espaciales.

CALT, la academia detrás del CZ-10A, anunció dos versiones reutilizables: CZ-10B, versión comercial del CZ-10A con posibles modificaciones, y CZ-10C, una versión de metano.

Según Trump, esta investigación forma parte de una “estrategia demócrata” para distraer la atención de temas como el supuesto fraude electoral. Además, instó a que se publiquen todos los nombres implicados en los documentos y se haga rendir cuentas a los responsables. 

Epstein, implicado en una red de abuso y prostitución de menores, se suicidó en prisión en 2019 mientras esperaba juicio.

Portugal destaca por ser el país menos asequible, donde prácticamente un salario completo se destina a un apartamento de este tipo, mientras que en Berna, Suiza, el coste representa solo el 24% del salario medio, siendo la ciudad más favorable. Otras regiones como Europa del Este, Sudeste y del Sur presentan ratios altos de alquiler respecto al salario, superando el 50%, lo que sitúa a las personas solteras en una situación económica más desfavorable al no poder compartir gastos.

El hallazgo supone un acontecimiento relevante para la conservación de la biodiversidad en el sudeste asiático y aporta nuevas esperanzas para la protección de especies amenazadas. Según los datos difundidos, la confirmación de la presencia de este felino se logró gracias a trabajos de campo recientes, que incluyeron el uso de cámaras trampa y la colaboración de expertos locales e internacionales en fauna salvaje.

Esta obra se distingue por su estilo narrativo, que alterna entre la biografía, la reflexión literaria y la crítica social. A través de una prosa impresionista y sutil, Cortines revela su proceso de autoconocimiento, mientras traza un retrato de su vida intelectual, afectiva y artística. Con un enfoque que abarca el amor, la amistad y el arte, el autor reflexiona también sobre las pérdidas y la inevitable presencia de la muerte, que marca el paso de los años. 'La edad ligera II' es más que un simple relato de memorias, pues también se convierte en una crítica a las injusticias sociales, un libro de viajes y una reflexión metafísica sobre la existencia y la belleza.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-segunda-parte-de-la-edad-ligera-de-jacobo-cortines-reflexiones-sobre-el-tiempo-la-memoria-y-la-muerte</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-segunda-parte-de-la-edad-ligera-de-jacobo-cortines-reflexiones-sobre-el-tiempo-la-memoria-y-la-muerte</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fracaso en el primer lanzamiento del cohete surcoreano HANBIT-Nano]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 23 de diciembre de 2025, la empresa surcoreana Innospace realizó su primer intento de colocar un cohete en órbita con el HANBIT-Nano desde el Centro Espacial de Alcântara en Brasil. Desgraciadamente, apenas treinta segundos tras el despegue, se produjo una anomalía en la primera etapa, y el cohete cayó al suelo 80 segundos después, destruyendo completamente la carga útil formada por cinco satélites. El HANBIT-Nano, un microlanzador orbital de dos etapas, puede colocar hasta 90 kg en órbita polar heliocéntrica y utiliza motores híbridos tanto en la primera como en la segunda etapa. Este lanzador es una evolución del HANBIT-TLV, un vector suborbital que había despegado con éxito en 2023, y forma parte de la estrategia de Innospace de desarrollar versiones futuras como el HANBIT-Micro y el HANBIT-Mini, capaces de llevar cargas más pesadas a órbita.

La película combina impresionantes avances en captura de movimiento y CGI con una narrativa que da voz a los indígenas y a la naturaleza, en contraposición a la perspectiva invasora y belicista de los humanos. Cameron utiliza la saga para criticar de forma contundente a nuestra especie y sus actitudes colonizadoras, estableciendo un paralelismo histórico con los pueblos indígenas y los errores del western clásico estadounidense. Además, reescribe los códigos del cine de aventuras y del western para ofrecer un enfoque interno ('emic'), desde la visión de los Na’vi, sus clanes y su mitología, mostrando respeto por el entorno y la cultura.

El arresto se produjo en una nave alejada del núcleo urbano, donde el prófugo se encontraba oculto. La operación fue posible gracias a la labor de la Sección de Localización de Fugitivos y a la colaboración ciudadana tras incluir su perfil en la lista de los diez delincuentes más buscados de España. Los hechos por los que Pavón fue condenado incluyen el hallazgo de dos cuerpos en un pozo: una de las víctimas falleció por un disparo de escopeta en el pecho y la otra a causa de múltiples lesiones con un objeto contundente. La detención se realizó tras detectar un vehículo con un ocupante con rasgos físicos similares a los del buscado, confirmando los agentes su identidad y procediendo a su arresto inmediato.

La Comisión de Fiestas, encargada de vender participaciones, imprimió y comercializó un número de boletos de forma que excedía el número real de décimos disponibles, generando un supuesto agujero de cuatro millones de euros. Durante una reunión en el Hogar del Pensionista, cerca de 300 participantes expresaron su preocupación y debatieron posibles soluciones. La opción más aceptada, aunque difícil, sería un acuerdo entre ganadores para renunciar a una parte del premio —aproximadamente un 6% de cada participación ganadora— que permitiría cubrir el déficit sin recurrir a la vía judicial. Si no se llega a un consenso, la alternativa sería iniciar procesos legales, lo que impediría cualquier pago hasta la resolución judicial y podría dirigir denuncias individuales hacia los responsables de la Comisión, que trabajan de forma voluntaria.

Este incidente se suma a una serie de detenciones similares ocurridas en los últimos años en la misma zona, una de las rutas más críticas para el transporte mundial de crudo, ya que por allí pasa aproximadamente una quinta parte del petróleo que se comercia globalmente.

Durante la primera semana, del 29 de diciembre al 4 de enero, se esperan temperaturas más frías de lo normal en casi toda España, salvo en Canarias, donde los valores serán suaves y acordes con la época del año. Las precipitaciones serán escasas en gran parte de la Península, aunque podrían registrarse lluvias en algunas zonas del litoral mediterráneo y en Baleares y Canarias. En la segunda semana, del 5 al 11 de enero, aumenta la incertidumbre en el pronóstico, pero todo apunta a que las temperaturas seguirán por debajo de lo habitual en la Península y Baleares.

Estas piezas estaban decoradas con cruces y llevaban inscripciones en griego que decían “Bendición del Señor desde los lugares sagrados”, y servían para transportar aceite, agua o tierra de sitios considerados santos. El hallazgo refleja la importancia de la industria de souvenirs religiosos en la época bizantina y la extensión de los viajes de peregrinos desde Jerusalén hasta otros puntos del Mediterráneo. Hyrcania, originalmente una fortaleza fundada durante la dinastía asmonea y reconstruida por Herodes el Grande, se convirtió en el siglo V en un monasterio cristiano vinculado a San Sabas.

Estas declaraciones se produjeron durante su tradicional maratón televisivo de final de año, un evento de varias horas en el que respondió a preguntas de ciudadanos y periodistas rusos y extranjeros. En respuesta a una pregunta del corresponsal de la BBC, Putin negó que Rusia tenga planes de atacar a otros países europeos y calificó de infundadas esas advertencias, aunque reiteró que Moscú está preparada para defenderse si se siente amenazada.

Putin volvió a culpar a la OTAN de haber incumplido supuestas promesas realizadas tras el final de la Guerra Fría sobre no expandirse hacia el este, argumento que utiliza de forma recurrente para justificar la invasión de Ucrania iniciada en febrero de 2022.

El incremento, que oscila entre 60 y 360 euros mensuales para la mayoría de la plantilla, y entre 240 y 360 euros para ingenieros de I+D, se enmarca en un contexto de intensa competencia en el sector automotriz chino, con numerosas marcas luchando por cuota de mercado y precios. El grupo atribuye la medida a la necesidad de mantener la innovación y evitar la fuga de talento hacia competidores, especialmente ante la presión de un mercado saturado donde los márgenes son estrechos y algunas compañías ya han cerrado.

García Aller recuerda que estas expresiones conviven en sociedades plurales y que no excluyen la libertad de expresión ni la convivencia. A lo largo de su reflexión, la periodista sitúa el tema en un contexto más amplio: la Navidad como periodo de celebración, ayuda a los necesitados y reflexión comunitaria. Señala que el cristianismo, y otros enfoques, deben coexistir sin que la lingüística de las festividades llegue a convertirse en una barrera para la inclusión.

Se cuestiona la coherencia de atribuir responsabilidad a los seres humanos cuando, si existiera un dios creador, éste sería el responsable de la desigualdad y las desgracias en el mundo. La entrada destaca la incongruencia de que milagros menores ocurran mientras persisten problemas graves como el cáncer infantil, y señala que la sociedad actual, con sus desigualdades, amplifica estas injusticias.

Este modelo es equivalente a un Audi A6 e-tron europeo en tamaño y prestaciones, pero con potencia similar a la del Audi e-tron GT, aunque con un coste comparable al de un Audi A3 en España. La diferencia de precios se explica por varios factores: se trata de una marca china, con plataforma y componentes de SAIC, producción local subvencionada por el gobierno, y mano de obra más económica. La estrategia del mercado chino, con fuerte competencia y control de la cadena de valor de vehículos eléctricos, permite ofrecer coches muy potentes a precios muy bajos.

La prueba, realizada por un equipo de la Universidad Nacional de Tecnología de Defensa (NUDT) en una pista de 400 metros, marca la velocidad más alta registrada en este tipo de plataforma a nivel mundial. El vehículo, que utiliza imanes superconductores para levitar y desplazarse sin fricción sobre la vía, completó la prueba de manera segura, demostrando el dominio tecnológico de China en sistemas de transporte ultra rápidos. Este avance es fruto de más de una década de investigación, durante la cual se superaron desafíos como la propulsión electromagnética a muy alta velocidad, la suspensión eléctrica, el almacenamiento y conversión de energía de alta potencia, y los imanes superconductores de campo intenso. El logro abre nuevas posibilidades para el desarrollo de transporte maglev en tubos al vacío, así como]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-logra-record-mundial-en-velocidad-de-trenes-de-levitacion-magnetica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-logra-record-mundial-en-velocidad-de-trenes-de-levitacion-magnetica</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Réquiem de Mozart en la Basílica de la Sagrada Familia - Concierto ARTE]]></title><description><![CDATA[Interpretación del Réquiem de Mozart realizada por la Orquesta y el Coro del Gran Teatre del Liceu en la majestuosa Basílica de la Sagrada Familia de Barcelona.

Estas entidades utilizan los problemas como capital político, económico y simbólico, prolongando crisis y polarización para mantener influencia, cohesión interna o beneficios. La política contemporánea se centra en la gestión de la percepción y no en soluciones de fondo, priorizando resultados visibles a corto plazo frente a reformas profundas y sostenidas en el tiempo. La polarización ideológica transforma los problemas en símbolos identitarios, lo que dificulta la cooperación y la resolución efectiva. Además, la complejidad estructural se convierte en excusa para no actuar, y quienes proponen soluciones de fondo son percibidos como fríos o elitistas.

El autor sostiene que este fenómeno no puede explicarse únicamente por la influencia de las redes sociales o por una supuesta frivolidad juvenil, sino por el fracaso de la democracia en dar respuesta a los principales problemas que afectan a las nuevas generaciones.

Sevilla argumenta que la política democrática ha perdido prestigio debido a la polarización extrema, la corrupción, el enfrentamiento permanente y la incapacidad de diálogo entre los partidos, lo que ha erosionado la confianza de los jóvenes en las instituciones. A ello se suma la falta de soluciones efectivas a problemas estructurales como el desempleo juvenil, la precariedad laboral y, especialmente, el acceso a la vivienda.

Sin embargo, investigaciones posteriores demostraron que todos los asistentes de esposas de presidentes anteriores también eran personas de confianza y no necesariamente expertos en protocolo.

Esta situación está generando preocupación entre muchas personas, especialmente ex autónomos con pensiones bajas. La Verbraucherzentrale NRW ofrece orientación sobre cómo afrontar estos incrementos. Entre las opciones disponibles se encuentra el cambio de tarifa dentro de la misma aseguradora, aunque con la advertencia de que ciertos beneficios pueden perderse permanentemente. Otra alternativa es renunciar a algunos servicios, como la habitación individual en hospitales o la atención de un médico especialista, o cambiar a tarifas con médico primario, donde se requiere acudir primero a un médico general. Incrementar el propio deducible es otra posibilidad para reducir la cuota mensual, aunque hay que considerar que esta medida no suele ser reversible sin una nueva evaluación de salud.

El organismo ha revisado al alza su estimación de crecimiento del PIB para 2025 hasta el 2,9%, frente al 2,6% previsto anteriormente, y anticipa una desaceleración moderada en 2026 y 2027, con avances del 2,2% y el 1,9%, respectivamente. Estas cifras consolidan a España como una de las economías más dinámicas de la zona euro en un contexto marcado por el estancamiento de la actividad en países clave como Alemania.

El crecimiento se apoya en varios pilares fundamentales. El consumo interno sigue siendo robusto, impulsado por el aumento de la población y una mayor participación en el mercado laboral, en parte gracias a la inmigración.

Según explica, el segundo mandato de Donald Trump se caracteriza por una aceleración autoritaria sin precedentes recientes, con ataques sistemáticos a minorías, restricciones a la libertad académica y ofensivas culturales contra periodistas, activistas y profesores universitarios. Bray destaca que la tecnología y las redes sociales han transformado la movilización de la extrema derecha, permitiendo que jóvenes se involucren en proyectos colectivos con la sensación de actuar individualmente. Además, advierte que políticas como la detención masiva de inmigrantes, los vetos a países extranjeros, los ataques a los derechos de las personas trans y la censura de términos en documentos oficiales reflejan un intento de imponer una nación cristiana y blanca.

Estas alzas afectan tanto a seguros individuales como colectivos y se deben a diversos factores, entre los que destacan el aumento de los costes sanitarios, la presión en precios de los proveedores y la mayor utilización de los seguros desde la pandemia. Las aseguradoras perciben que los clientes mantienen fidelidad a pesar de las subidas, debido a la sensación de deterioro de la sanidad pública y las largas listas de espera. Según Rastreator, la variabilidad de precios puede alcanzar hasta el 72%, con seguros básicos a partir de 46 euros y completos hasta 74 euros. Además, la concentración de proveedores privados tras fusiones y compras ha aumentado el poder de negociación de hospitales y clínicas, elevando los costes.

Este paquete incluye sistemas ofensivos de largo alcance como lanzadores HIMARS, misiles ATACMS y cohetes GMLRS, capaces de alcanzar el territorio continental chino. La medida, que sigue la política de estrechar la cooperación militar con Taiwán, ha sido criticada por Pekín como una violación del principio de 'una sola China' y una provocación que amenaza la estabilidad en el estrecho de Taiwán. Además, se incrementa la presencia militar estadounidense en la región mediante la participación de instructores y fuerzas especiales en maniobras y planificación de combate. El Gobierno taiwanés, alineado con Estados Unidos, ha aumentado su gasto militar y reforzado el servicio militar obligatorio.

El cura de la localidad publicó en Wallapop un anuncio para vender las puertas de la iglesia, incluyendo una puerta barroca del siglo XVI, a un precio de 390 euros. Este templo es relevante históricamente porque se cree que alberga la tumba del renombrado escultor Alonso Berruguete, cuyos restos se intentaron localizar años atrás mediante georradar. La noticia fue alertada por la vecina Malena Alonso, quien informó a la alcaldesa María Luisa Escalante. Según fuentes oficiales, la venta se realizó a través de un amigo del cura, y las puertas finalmente no se vendieron.

La intervención policial incluyó la dispersión de las actividades festivas, el decomiso de equipo y la entrada en una academia de música sin autorización. Testigos y la propia Mossawa describen videos que muestran a oficiales arrastrando al disfraz de Santa Claus, interrumpiendo un dabke callejero y agrediendo a asistentes, mientras que la policía señaló que se trató de un incidente de “ruido inusual y alteración del orden público”.

La norma, conocida como 'Energy Consumption Limits for Electric Vehicles', establece límites de consumo basados en el peso en vacío y las características del vehículo, endureciendo los requisitos de eficiencia en un 11% respecto a los estándares anteriores no obligatorios. Se estima que, tras las mejoras técnicas necesarias, la autonomía de los vehículos aumentará un 7% con baterías de la misma capacidad. La regulación no afecta a los híbridos enchufables ni a los eléctricos de autonomía extendida, aunque sí se elevará la autonomía mínima requerida para acceder a incentivos fiscales. Muchos modelos actuales ya cumplen los nuevos requisitos, por lo que no necesitarán modificaciones.

La pareja le brindó cuidados básicos, apoyo emocional y ayudó a Ronnie a integrarse en la sociedad, consiguiéndole un empleo como recolector de basura y facilitándole ropa y educación social. Ronnie desarrolló diversas rutinas diarias y colaboró activamente en la iglesia local, mostrando siempre su generosidad y dedicación a los demás, a pesar de luchar con adicciones y ciertas dificultades sociales.

Ferran Adrià, reconocido chef español, cuestionó esta afirmación señalando que en España solo un pequeño porcentaje de la población alcanza salarios elevados.

Adrià subrayó que la aspiración de la mayoría no debería centrarse en marcas exclusivas, sino en expectativas más realistas según la situación económica de cada uno.

El título original, 'Siente un pobre a su mesa', fue prohibido por su carácter crítico con la moral y la tradición católica. Incluso la segunda propuesta, 'Los Bienaventurados', fue rechazada por considerarla excesivamente evangélica. Finalmente, la película se estrenó con el nombre 'Plácido', aunque los censores llegaron a recomendar su prohibición total. La documentación recopilada por la Associació Memòria i Història de Manresa, disponible en memoria.cat, incluye más de setenta comunicaciones que muestran cómo la Junta de Clasificación y Censura recortó escenas y emitió informes sobre el contenido, criticando su humor negro, el ataque a la religión y la representación de la sociedad.

Todas ellas compartían un mismo administrador, Manuel Alba Fernández, y estaban domiciliadas en la misma dirección. Cada empresa solicitaba 15 licencias, siguiendo un patrón ya conocido en el sector de transporte, que busca rodear la normativa mediante sociedades instrumentales y aparentes independencias. El Juzgado de lo Contencioso-Administrativo número 31 respaldó al Ayuntamiento de Madrid, afirmando que las empresas no habían seguido el procedimiento legal correcto y que el taxi es un servicio público, no un mercado libre sin reglas. Aunque la sentencia aún puede ser recurrida, marca un precedente importante para limitar la concentración de licencias y proteger el equilibrio del sector. Este caso pone de relieve la tensión entre la protección del servicio público y los intereses empresariales, subrayando la necesidad de reglas claras]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Colosal error de Óscar Puente frente a Mariló Montero: 4 bulos en 1 minuto, récord mundial.

Sin embargo, este buen desempeño macroeconómico no se refleja en la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos.

El salario mínimo interprofesional ha subido a 1.184 euros mensuales, pero incluso esta cifra resulta insuficiente en las grandes ciudades. La vivienda es uno de los principales factores de presión económica, con alquileres que superan los 14 euros por metro cuadrado y subidas de precios que pueden absorber gran parte del salario.

Tras liderar a su partido a la victoria en las elecciones de febrero de 2025, la CDU quedó lejos de la mayoría absoluta, obligando a formar una Gran Coalición con los socialdemócratas del SPD. Aunque Merz prometió mejorar la economía y fortalecer la posición internacional de Alemania, su gestión ha sido percibida como insuficiente.

Béjar cuestiona que la nuclear contribuya a la independencia energética de España, dado que el país no produce uranio y depende de suministros de países como Rusia. Además, critica la falta de debate sobre la gestión de residuos nucleares y considera injustificado el apoyo económico que reciben las centrales frente a las renovables, cuyos precios pueden caer cerca de cero. El empresario subraya que uno de los principales problemas del sistema eléctrico es la saturación de la red, que en 2024 denegó 33 GW de solicitudes de conexión y saturó el 83% de los nudos de conexión. Para afrontar los precios bajos del mercado, Bruc apuesta por la instalación de baterías, con planes de aumentar 2,2 GW de capacidad en 2026 y 0,7 GW en nuevas placas solares, sumando una cartera total de 6,6 GW.

La plataforma 'Libertad 6 de Zaragoza' señala que este avance llega con cinco meses de retraso respecto a la aprobación judicial que permitía recibir tratamiento fuera de prisión, tras ser diagnosticado psiquiátricamente en la cárcel de Zuera. Desde la plataforma denuncian graves deficiencias en la atención a personas con salud mental, especialmente en población reclusa, y destacan que Imad también ha sufrido racismo estructural dentro del sistema penitenciario. Además, se le ha denegado repetidamente el tercer grado penitenciario, manteniéndolo en segundo grado, a pesar de su diagnóstico y de las recomendaciones previas.

Según datos de ACEA que abarcan la Unión Europea, Reino Unido y los países de la Asociación Europea de Libre Comercio, se matricularon 253.768 turismos eléctricos, lo que representa un aumento del 37,3% respecto al mismo mes del año anterior.

Los modelos de gasolina bajaron al 23,1% y los híbridos enchufables (PHEV) consiguieron un 10,4%. Esto refleja que un 33,9% de los compradores europeos eligieron coches enchufables, superando a los híbridos convencionales. El diésel se sitúa en el 6,9% y otras tecnologías en el 2,7%.

A pesar de que varios docentes ya habían advertido internamente sobre la conducta del trabajador del comedor, el colegio mantuvo al presunto agresor en su puesto durante todo un curso escolar.

Las familias, cuyos hijos tenían entre tres y seis años, aseguran que la dirección del centro actuó con silencio, minimización de los hechos y peticiones de discreción, lo que a su juicio buscaba evitar un escándalo público y proteger la reputación del colegio, vinculado al Opus Dei.

Aunque su acción era ilegal según la ley DORA, Jebb buscaba visibilizar el sufrimiento de los niños y usar su detención para amplificar su mensaje humanitario. Nacida en 1876 en una familia acomodada, estudió historia en Oxford y, tras la muerte de su hermano, dedicó su vida a ayudar a los más necesitados. Su trabajo en los Balcanes y con la Charity Organisation Society le permitió constatar que la pobreza se debía más a la injusticia que a la desgracia. Tras la guerra, ella y su hermana Dorothy documentaron la hambruna en Europa y fundaron el Consejo de Lucha contra la Hambruna.

Este hábito repercute en las relaciones familiares, la salud mental y en el ejemplo que se da a los hijos. Estudios muestran que un adulto revisa el teléfono entre 80 y 150 veces al día, generando una sensación constante de urgencia que afecta la comunicación cara a cara. La exposición de los menores a los dispositivos está condicionada por el comportamiento de los adultos: si durante la comida o el ocio familiar todos miran el móvil, los niños perciben que el dispositivo es más importante que las personas.

Aunque el texto inicial que acompaña al enlace contiene una secuencia incongruente de caracteres y palabras en varios idiomas, el contexto indica una respuesta oficial iraní ante las presiones estadounidenses. El país persa habría dejado claro que no cederá ante presiones externas y que sus decisiones se basan en sus propios intereses y en la defensa de su soberanía. Este tipo de declaraciones suele ir acompañado de un análisis de la política externa iraní, que enfatiza la necesidad de independencia frente a influencias externas. En el marco de las tensiones entre Irán y Estados Unidos, el artículo podría también referirse a sanciones, negociaciones o posturas estratégicas sobre el programa nuclear, seguridad regional y relaciones con aliados.

Su investigación, basada en la observación directa, el análisis geográfico y la consulta con los habitantes locales, ha permitido actualizar su diccionario toponímico, que ahora recoge más de 44.000 topónimos. La etimología de estos nombres combina influencias preindoeuropeas, indoeuropeas, celtas, latinas y medievales, así como factores relacionados con el agua, el paisaje, las rocas, los caminos, los animales, las plantas y antiguas divinidades. Algunos nombres de concejos como Oviedo, Gijón o Morcín presentan múltiples interpretaciones debido a su compleja historia, mientras que otros reflejan directamente la geografía, la flora, la fauna o la organización social de los pueblos antiguos.

La medida se enmarca dentro de un esfuerzo más amplio por proteger la seguridad nacional y reducir la dependencia de tecnología extranjera considerada de riesgo. Esta regulación, respaldada por la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC), impide que nuevos modelos de drones y componentes críticos obtenidos fuera de EE.UU. reciban la aprobación para su comercialización. Sin embargo, los drones ya adquiridos por consumidores y empresas seguirán siendo legales, por lo que la prohibición solo afecta a modelos más recientes. Según las autoridades estadounidenses, los drones extranjeros podrían ser utilizados para vigilancia, exfiltración de datos o incluso generar riesgos en infraestructuras críticas.

Publicado en Cell Reports Medicine, el estudio demuestra que restaurar el equilibrio del NAD+, una molécula central para la energía celular, puede prevenir e incluso revertir el Alzheimer en ratones con la enfermedad avanzada. Los investigadores utilizaron modelos animales que replican mutaciones humanas en proteínas asociadas al Alzheimer, como la beta-amiloide y la tau, y encontraron que la recuperación del NAD+ permitió corregir patologías cerebrales y restaurar la función cognitiva. Además, los niveles de tau fosforilada 217, un biomarcador clínico de la enfermedad, también se normalizaron, confirmando la reversión de la enfermedad.

El gran jefe Cuerno Verde, cuyo nombre indígena era Tabivo Naritgant, heredó el liderazgo de su padre y se convirtió en un formidable enemigo de los asentamientos españoles en Nuevo México. Sus incursiones y ataques constantes llevaron a Madrid a organizar una expedición dirigida por Juan Bautista de Anza, gobernador de Nuevo México desde 1777. Anza, experimentado en tácticas de caballería ligera, ideó un plan de emboscada que permitió acorralar a Cuerno Verde y sus hombres en las faldas de la actual Greenhorn Mountain en Colorado el 3 de septiembre de 1779, donde murieron junto a su hijo y otros jefes comanches.

En 2025, se conmemoraban 50 años de la primera intervención televisada de un monarca tras la muerte de Franco y 40 años de la entrada de España en la Unión Europea. El rey centró su mensaje en conceptos abstractos como 'Europa', 'convivencia' y 'confianza', evitando abordar directamente los problemas políticos actuales, la polarización social y el auge del fascismo. Según el autor, Gerardo Tecé, el discurso fue breve y simbólico, más enfocado en la puesta en escena que en contenido concreto, adoptando una estrategia de equidistancia que pretende no posicionarse ni a favor ni en contra de distintos sectores de la sociedad. Tecé critica que la monarquía use esta estrategia para evadir responsabilidades en la crisis democrática y social del país, comparando irónicamente al rey con un 'Mortadelo' inten]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-critico-del-discurso-de-navidad-de-felipe-vi-en-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-critico-del-discurso-de-navidad-de-felipe-vi-en-2025</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tribunal absuelve a un hombre de estafa por negligencia del denunciante]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Canarias (TSJC) ha absuelto a un hombre previamente condenado a cuatro años de prisión por estafa en la venta de viviendas, tras considerar que la víctima actuó con desidia y negligencia al entregar sucesivamente importantes sumas de dinero sin recibir ninguna propiedad a cambio. La sentencia destaca que las estafas fueron burdas y reiteradas, sumando un total de 246.000 euros en seis operaciones durante año y medio. El acusado se hizo pasar por un agente inmobiliario con experiencia y ofreció viviendas a precios muy bajos de fondos buitres, recibiendo transferencias y cheques por montos significativos. Aunque en ningún caso se formalizó la compra, tras la amenaza de acciones judiciales devolvió 100.000 euros, lo que permitió aplicar la atenuante de reparación del daño.

Fulnecky denunció que la nota se debía a sus creencias religiosas y a su ejercicio de la libertad de expresión, ya que en el ensayo citaba repetidamente la Biblia y defendía que la existencia de múltiples identidades de género se alejaba del “plan original de Dios”.

Usando equipos más antiguos de litografía ultravioleta profunda (UVP), adquiridos antes del veto, han conseguido fabricar procesadores de 7 nanómetros —e incluso de 5 nm— empleando una técnica conocida como 'multi-patterning'. Este método consiste en realizar múltiples pasadas sobre la misma oblea de silicio para alcanzar una mayor densidad de los circuitos, algo que normalmente solo sería posible con maquinaria UVE de última generación. 

El avance, que ha permitido la producción del Kirin 9000S y el reciente Kirin 9030, demuestra el ingenio técnico de SMIC pese a las limitaciones de hardware.

Mientras muchos compañeros abandonaban la compañía, él optó por quedarse, formarse y adaptarse a los cambios con el objetivo de seguir siendo útil y competitivo.

El despido se produjo de manera inesperada, dentro de un recorte de plantilla que afectó a unas 200 personas en varios países europeos. Favre sospecha que la causa principal fue su coste salarial, ya que con los años había mejorado sus condiciones, y también la deslocalización de funciones hacia países con mano de obra más barata.

Rubio destaca que la adicción al alcohol es una enfermedad crónica con predisposición a recaídas, y que la vulnerabilidad persiste incluso tras la abstinencia. Se enfatiza que la diferencia de género existe: las mujeres pueden sufrir daños neurológicos con menores consumos por la mayor sensibilidad de sus neuronas a tóxicos. El artículo concluye que el tratamiento efectivo requiere un enfoque integral que combine desintoxicación, terapia cognitivo-conductual y, crucialmente, apoyo comunitario y grupos de ayuda mutua.

La documentación presentada revela que Feijóo fue quien contactó primero con Mazón a las 19:59 horas, evidenciando que no hubo comunicación entre ambos durante las horas en que Mazón se encontraba con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana en El Ventorro. Los mensajes muestran que Mazón tardó en contestar y lo hizo escasos minutos antes del envío del Es-Alert, el sistema de alerta ante emergencias. Feijóo también ha solicitado que su comparecencia prevista para el 9 de enero como testigo se realice por medios telemáticos. La publicación de estos mensajes busca clarificar la gestión de la crisis y la coordinación entre las autoridades durante el episodio de lluvias intensas, conocido como DANA, que provocó graves incidencias en la región.

Se detalla cómo la Comunidad de Madrid, Galicia, Valencia, Andalucía y otras regiones gobernadas por el PP han adoptado modelos de gestión privada en hospitales públicos, generando sobrecostes, largas listas de espera y problemas de saturación en urgencias. Se mencionan casos concretos como los hospitales de Alzira y Torrejón de Ardoz, donde las concesionarias priorizaron el beneficio económico sobre la atención sanitaria, empeorando las condiciones laborales del personal y reduciendo recursos esenciales. También se denuncia la implicación de altos cargos políticos y empresas privadas en prácticas cuestionables, así como el impacto en pacientes y ancianos.

Este juicio forma parte del caso Lezo, que investiga una trama de corrupción vinculada al PP madrileño. Los retrasos en el sistema judicial español han provocado que el juicio se celebre más de seis años después de que se iniciara la investigación. González se enfrenta a una posible condena de seis años de prisión por tráfico de influencias, cohecho y fraude a la administración pública, en un caso que también afecta a varios familiares de González, como su hermano y su cuñado. Los acusados supuestamente se beneficiaron de contratos públicos sin la capacidad técnica para llevar a cabo los trabajos asignados.

La medida busca evitar un aumento brusco de costes y una espiral inflacionaria mientras el país desarrolla su propia capacidad de producción mediante la Ley de Chips. Aunque se mantiene la postura firme frente a China en la guerra tecnológica, la suspensión refleja la imposibilidad de un desacople total a corto plazo sin dañar la economía estadounidense. Los fabricantes habían advertido de incrementos de costes de hasta un 25% en sectores críticos, lo que podría repercutir directamente en los precios al consumidor. China, por su parte, sigue teniendo influencia sobre materiales estratégicos como tierras raras y minerales críticos, lo que refuerza la interdependencia.

Investigadores como Lluis Montoliu y Gemma Marfany destacan que existen métodos más seguros, como el diagnóstico genético preimplantacional, que permiten seleccionar embriones sin mutaciones patógenas sin necesidad de editar su ADN.

La licitación fue publicada en plena semana de Navidad y afecta a una superficie de 3.042 metros cuadrados, valorada en más de 2,3 millones de euros. Este intento sucede tras la anulación de un concurso anterior debido a las deudas del Arzobispado con el Ayuntamiento. Aunque la convocatoria está abierta a otras confesiones religiosas, todo apunta a que la única oferta provendrá de la Iglesia. El proyecto original, conocido como 'minivaticano', incluía un gran templo, oficinas, auditorio y otros servicios, pero fue cuestionado por su posible aprovechamiento económico indebido.

La política se ha convertido en espectáculo y los líderes visibles actúan como pararrayos de indignación colectiva, absorbendo críticas y polémicas que desvían la atención de los asuntos estructurales que realmente importan. La incompetencia aparente de estos líderes es funcional: permite al sistema financiero y corporativo consolidar su poder sin interferencias.

Estas afirmaciones provocaron burlas y críticas en redes sociales y entre economistas, que señalaron que el crecimiento del PIB no se traduce directamente en un incremento uniforme de los ingresos personales. El informe del Departamento de Comercio también indicó que el gasto de los consumidores subió un 3,5 %, mientras que la inflación sigue siendo una preocupación, con índices superiores al objetivo del 2 % de la Reserva Federal.

La torreta ofrecía poca protección y su diseño limitado dificultaba cualquier intento de escape rápido, especialmente en emergencia. Los artilleros debían permanecer en posición fetal, operando las ametralladoras Browning AN/M2 de calibre .50 desde un espacio extremadamente reducido, lo que requería tanto fuerza física como una gran concentración.

Estas palabras, lejos de tranquilizar al sector, provocaron un fuerte impacto en los mercados y un profundo malestar entre productores que, en su mayoría, habían apoyado políticamente al presidente.

El caso de Gary Vetter, ganadero de Iowa con más de cinco décadas de experiencia, refleja el sentir generalizado. Tras superar sequías, cambios en la demanda y tensiones comerciales internacionales, Vetter considera que las declaraciones de Trump y las medidas posteriores de su administración han generado un riesgo inesperado para su actividad.

La acusación se basaba en una anotación encontrada en un post-it durante registros en el despacho de la fiscal, en la que aparecían las indicaciones “Restaurante Manuel Becerra” y “Begoña Gómez Fernández”, pero separadas claramente por una línea. Los jueces consideran que estas anotaciones son meras sospechas sin evidencia de reunión ni de divulgación indebida de información. La anotación sobre el restaurante se refería a una consulta interna de la Fiscalía sobre un incendio mortal en un local y la mención a Begoña Gómez estaba relacionada con la recopilación de información sobre denuncias previas, sin conexión entre ambos elementos.

El analista político Antón Losada ha mostrado su rechazo a este acto, calificándolo de un uso poco elegante de las instituciones y destacando que parece responder más a intereses personales y electorales que a motivos culturales o sociales. Losada señala que actos como este, alineados con un discurso ideológico y religioso cerrado, no deberían emplearse desde instituciones públicas, sugiriendo que se podrían organizar actividades más inclusivas y neutrales. Hakuna, vinculado al Opus Dei y fundado por el sacerdote José Pedro Manglano, surgió en 2013 durante la Jornada Mundial de la Juventud y se centra en un estilo de vida basado en la fe católica. Actualmente funciona como asociación privada de fieles con aprobación del cardenal Carlos Osoro.

Esta medida, resultado de negociaciones directas entre el enviado especial John Cole y el régimen de Aliaksandr Lukashenka, ha permitido la liberación de 123 presos políticos, incluyendo al Nobel de la Paz Ales Bialiatski. Sin embargo, más allá del aspecto humanitario, el movimiento afecta al mercado agrícola europeo, ya que la potasa es un insumo clave para fertilizantes y la seguridad alimentaria. La UE no considera la potasa como materia prima crítica, lo que aumenta su dependencia de proveedores externos y deja a los agricultores vulnerables a fluctuaciones geopolíticas. Ante este escenario, proyectos europeos como Mina Muga, en Navarra y Aragón, adquieren una relevancia estratégica al ofrecer potasa de proximidad, reducir costes logísticos y cumplir con los estándares del Pacto Verde Europeo.

Entre estos hallazgos destaca una fotografía encontrada en el teléfono de Steve Bannon que muestra a Trump junto a Maxwell, la cual fue redactada en su totalidad en los documentos oficiales. Además, se revelan correos electrónicos que indican que Trump viajó en el jet privado de Epstein más veces de lo que había declarado públicamente, en algunos vuelos acompañado de Maxwell y familiares suyos. Otro documento polémico es una supuesta carta de Epstein a Larry Nassar, mencionando a Trump, aunque el FBI declaró posteriormente que dicha carta era falsa.

A punto de estrenarse la película Emergency Exit, de Lluís Miñarro, Pla interpreta a un director de cine extremadamente complejo, y su visión sobre el arte es contundente: “un trabajo como cualquier otro” y “no me transformo en nada, solo sigo indicaciones”.

Además, subraya el tono lacrimógeno del relato y cuestiona la veracidad de afirmaciones sobre Franco y la Transición, señalando que Juan Carlos exagera su papel y minimiza la oposición del dictador a la democratización de España.

Según datos de la Comisión Europea, la edad media de los agricultores en la UE es de 57 años y solo el 12 % tiene menos de 40 años, lo que pone en riesgo la continuidad del sector primario. En este contexto, Samanta, una joven agricultora de Níjar (Almería), ha dado visibilidad a esta problemática a través de un vídeo en TikTok que ha tenido una amplia repercusión.

En su intervención, Samanta rechaza la idea de que los jóvenes no quieran dedicarse al campo y subraya que el verdadero problema es la imposibilidad económica de hacerlo.

La jueza Luisa María Prieto Ramírez argumenta que el Código Penal no contempla la figura de desórdenes públicos y desobediencia en su modalidad “imprudente”, requisito necesario para imputar responsabilidad penal al delegado. Para que existiera delito, sería necesario que el acusado hubiera actuado con dolo, es decir, con intención de causar daño a los agentes, algo que no se demuestra en la querella.

La polémica se centra en que el desahucio se realizó sin garantizar alternativas habitacionales a las personas afectadas, incumpliendo expresamente un mandato judicial que exigía la atención de los servicios sociales. Además, se ha señalado que Albiol alentó a un grupo de personas con actitudes xenófobas, dificultando la ayuda de parroquias y ONG que intentaban asistir a los desalojados.

Aunque la Secretaría de Estado de Memoria Democrática activó todos los trámites necesarios para hacer efectiva la ayuda antes del cierre del ejercicio presupuestario, el Consistorio condicionó su aceptación a la firma de un convenio con la Junta de Andalucía y la Diputación, pese a contar con un protocolo marco firmado por todas las administraciones desde junio.

Entre los afectados se encuentra Thierry Breton, excomisario europeo de Mercado Interior, quien impulsó regulaciones para limitar la desinformación en redes como X, Meta y TikTok. También figura Imran Ahmed, activista británico y director del Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). El secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, afirmó que estas personas han liderado esfuerzos organizados para coaccionar plataformas estadounidenses, por lo que se les aplicarán restricciones de visado y posibles procesos de deportación si se encontraran en el país. Esta medida llega tras la multa de 130 millones de euros impuesta por la Comisión Europea a X por incumplir obligaciones de transparencia, hecho que la administración Trump calificó como un ataque al pueblo estadounidense.

Esta división tiene implicaciones directas sobre el acceso al aborto: mientras que en Tennessee es ilegal tras el fallo de la Corte Suprema de 2022, en Virginia sigue siendo legal. La única clínica de abortos de la ciudad, la Clínica de Salud Femenina de Bristol, se trasladó a Virginia para poder operar legalmente. Sin embargo, la clínica enfrenta constantes intentos de presión por parte de activistas antiaborto, incluyendo órdenes de desalojo por parte de sus propietarios y propuestas de aplicar leyes locales restrictivas. Estas acciones reflejan la estrategia de algunos grupos de restringir el aborto a nivel local, incluso en estados donde es legal.

Mientras tanto, los VMP no deberán registrarse ni asegurarse, excepto aquellos que superen los 25 kilos de peso y 14 km/h de velocidad máxima, que sí deben contar con un seguro obligatorio.

Paralelamente, el porcentaje de pisos en manos de propietarios únicos ha descendido del 64 % al 54 %, indicando un aumento progresivo de los multipropietarios.

Este sistema está diseñado para actuar en caso de que el piloto quede incapacitado durante el vuelo, asumiendo el control del avión y llevándolo de forma completamente autónoma hasta el aeropuerto más adecuado. Durante el proceso, el Autoland no solo calcula el destino más apropiado basándose en la distancia, las condiciones de la pista y el combustible disponible, sino que además se comunica activamente con el control aéreo y con los pasajeros mediante mensajes de voz automatizados. El incidente ocurrió en una aeronave Beech B200 Super King Air que volaba entre Aspen y el Aeropuerto Regional de las Montañas Rocosas, en Colorado.

Inicialmente, el buque había partido de Estambul rumbo al Caribe con destino a Venezuela, transportando nafta destinada al régimen de Nicolás Maduro, pero modificó su trayectoria para eludir la vigilancia de la Armada de Estados Unidos. Agate forma parte de la llamada 'flota fantasma', compuesta por antiguos petroleros con banderas de conveniencia y sistemas de navegación que evitan el control internacional.

Partiendo de la definición de pseudoterapia de la Asociación Médica Mundial, el texto subraya que se trata de prácticas sin respaldo empírico que prometen beneficios para la salud, explotando la vulnerabilidad de las personas y retrasando el acceso a tratamientos eficaces.

Entre los ejemplos más extendidos se encuentran la acupuntura aplicada a trastornos psicológicos, la bioenergética, las constelaciones familiares, la dianética, las flores de Bach, la homeopatía, la programación neurolingüística y el reiki. Todas ellas comparten elementos comunes: la apelación a conceptos no demostrados como la “energía vital”, la “fuerza vital”, los “meridianos” o la “memoria del agua”, así como el uso de un lenguaje aparentemente técnico que pretende dotarlas de legitimidad científica.

Hasta noviembre, el Estado presentó un saldo positivo de 640 millones de euros, frente al déficit de 8.740 millones del mismo periodo del año anterior. Este cambio se debe principalmente al aumento de los ingresos tributarios, que crecieron un 9,4% en contabilidad nacional, mientras que el gasto público aumentó en un 5,5%, igualando el crecimiento del PIB nominal. La prórroga de los presupuestos estatales ha contenido parcialmente el gasto estatal, aunque aún está pendiente la subida salarial retroactiva de los empleados públicos. En contraste, las comunidades autónomas presentan un deterioro de sus cuentas, con un déficit creciente pese a la financiación récord, y solo País Vasco y Navarra mantienen superávit por su régimen especial.

Esta decisión se suma al relevo de Ortega Smith como portavoz adjunto del grupo parlamentario, lo cual él mismo calificó como 'injusto'.

La operación ha llevado a la detención de siete personas, que formaban parte de un grupo criminal dedicado al expolio de sitios como la antigua ciudad de Lancia, en León, y el yacimiento de Mayorga, en Valladolid. Los detenidos utilizaban detectores de metales de alta tecnología para extraer monedas, áureos romanos, fíbulas y otros objetos históricos, los cuales posteriormente vendían por internet o en transacciones privadas. Se estima que el valor de las piezas recuperadas podría rondar el millón de euros en el mercado negro. La investigación, que comenzó a principios de 2025, culminó con la incautación de más de 6.000 monedas, varios áureos romanos, y un importante número de objetos de valor histórico.

El programa mostró a jóvenes militantes y religiosos compartiendo su visión positiva de estos grupos, sin explorar suficientemente la relación de estos movimientos con la extrema derecha o su vinculación con la manipulación de la fe. José Antonio Naz Valverde, presidente de Europa Laica, denunció la falta de diversidad de opiniones en el programa, subrayando que el enfoque mediático distorsionó la realidad de la juventud española, dando una imagen distorsionada de la juventud como fervientes seguidores del catolicismo.

Aunque las formaciones ultranacionalistas europeas celebran el ataque a la UE, su apoyo está matizado, ya que la injerencia de Trump choca con su propio ideario ultranacionalista. Líderes como Giorgia Meloni y Nigel Farage ven la estrategia de Trump como una oportunidad para avanzar en sus propios intereses políticos, pero reconocen las limitaciones de una cooperación que no ofrece un proyecto ideológico común. A pesar de las diferencias, los líderes ultraconservadores europeos aprecian la postura de Trump en temas como la inmigración y la defensa. Sin embargo, la ausencia de una agenda común plantea interrogantes sobre la viabilidad de estos vínculos.

Los cuerpos fueron encontrados en plena calle tras un aviso de una vecina, que vio cómo los agresores trataban de sacar los cadáveres de la casa.

La organización también critica las políticas del partido Vox, especialmente su postura contra los migrantes, las mujeres y las lenguas cooficiales, acusándolos de usar la tragedia para fortalecer su imagen política.

Esta decisión ha generado controversia, ya que se ha considerado que estas obras no son esenciales para el dominio público marítimo-terrestre. Aunque inicialmente se había señalado que las instalaciones podrían ubicarse fuera de esta zona protegida, la promotora defendió que su construcción era necesaria para atender la demanda de servicios turísticos en la zona. La Dirección de Costas argumentó que el proyecto es beneficioso para la economía turística de las islas, un aspecto clave para el desarrollo económico canario. Sin embargo, esta autorización ha sido criticada por colectivos ecologistas que alertan sobre los posibles impactos ambientales de las obras.

Un informe de auditoría reveló que varios contratos menores no se ajustan a la normativa, especialmente en lo que respecta a patrocinios, algunos de los cuales deberían haberse tratado como subvenciones. Además, se identificaron complementos salariales indebidos a empleados de la Fundación, los cuales deberán ser reintegrados. Estos hallazgos han motivado a los partidos PSPV y Compromís a pedir la ampliación de la denuncia contra Badenas. La auditoría también destaca otras incidencias en la contratación de personal, en la que se cuestionan los procedimientos seguidos y las retribuciones otorgadas a varios directivos, incluida la del subdirector de emprendimiento.

Alega que esta táctica, extendida desde la vuelta de Donald Trump a la presidencia en 2025, se emplea en lugares sensibles como cortes, lugares de culto y escuelas, generando miedo y debilitando la confianza en las fuerzas de seguridad. El informe recoge testimonios de 18 testigos y numerosos videos de arrestos, destacando incidentes en ciudades como Chicago y Washington D.C. Se señala que la anonimidad impide identificar responsables, obstaculiza investigaciones y promueve la impunidad.

Utilizando ondas acústicas dentro de un circuito cerrado de gas, esta tecnología permite transferir calor de zonas frías a zonas calientes de forma más eficiente que los sistemas tradicionales. El prototipo, basado en un ciclo Stirling termoacústico, logra temperaturas extremas sin recurrir a la combustión ni compresión mecánica. Este avance no solo mejora la eficiencia energética, sino que también abre la puerta a nuevas aplicaciones industriales, especialmente en sectores como la metalurgia y la petroquímica, que requieren calor a altas temperaturas. Además, la bomba de calor termoacústica tiene el potencial de reciclar calor residual de procesos industriales, lo que contribuiría a reducir el desperdicio de energía en China, donde se pierde entre un 10% y un 27% de la energía en forma de calor residual]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr: de pionera en el cine a inventora clave del WiFi]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr, nacida en Viena en 1914, fue una mujer que rompió moldes tanto en el cine como en la ciencia. A los 19 años, protagonizó la película 'Éxtasis', donde realizó el primer desnudo integral en la historia del cine y simuló un orgasmo, lo que causó gran escándalo en su época. Posteriormente, Lamarr pasó a ser esposa de Fritz Mandl, un magnate armamentístico que la sometió a un control extremo, lo que la llevó a huir a Hollywood. En Estados Unidos, fue renombrada como Hedy Lamarr y se convirtió en una de las grandes divas de la pantalla. Sin embargo, su verdadera pasión estaba en la ciencia. Durante sus noches de descanso, Lamarr desarrolló una tecnología que más tarde sería fundamental para la creación de WiFi, Bluetooth y otros avances en telecomunicaciones. Aunque en su época se le valoró más por su belleza que por su inteligencia, hoy se reconoce su legado como una innovadora tecnológica, recibiendo premios póstumos como el Pioner Award.

Vázquez, conocido por su vida bohemia y su pasión por el bingo, se destacó por su capacidad para hacer reír a públicos de todas las edades, utilizando un trazo ágil y una comedia incisiva. Su estilo irreverente, que en ocasiones rozaba lo políticamente incorrecto, ha perdurado con el paso del tiempo, siendo aún hoy una referencia en el cómic español.

Además de la pena de prisión, cada una deberá pagar una indemnización de 6.000 euros a la víctima por los daños morales causados. El tribunal considera que el comportamiento de las acusadas no puede considerarse como una simple broma, sino como un acoso reiterado que causó una grave persecución hacia la víctima. La sentencia también incluye una medida de alejamiento de tres años y medio hacia la perjudicada.

Esto implica que el sistema educativo público perdería parte de su carácter gratuito y obligatorio. Las escuelas públicas y privadas podrán diseñar sus propios planes de estudio, y las familias tendrán poder para decidir sobre la dirección de las instituciones.

Este hallazgo contradice la creencia popular de que los motores de combustión son más eficientes. Según Johannes Kückens, físico alemán, los motores de combustión nunca podrán superar un 45% de eficiencia debido a las leyes de la termodinámica, mientras que los motores eléctricos pueden alcanzar cifras cercanas al 90%. A pesar de los avances en la tecnología de los vehículos de combustión, la eficiencia energética sigue siendo muy limitada. Kückens también criticó la apuesta de la Unión Europea por los biocombustibles o e-fuels, señalando que, con la misma cantidad de electricidad, un coche eléctrico puede recorrer seis veces más distancia que uno alimentado con e-fuels.

Esta acción forma parte de una serie de movimientos diseñados para reconfigurar la postura diplomática estadounidense en el extranjero, priorizando una mayor alineación con las políticas de la administración. Este recorte de personal diplomático incluye figuras clave que habían estado en posiciones de liderazgo en embajadas alrededor del mundo. El Secretario de Estado Marco Rubio defendió la medida como parte de una reorganización necesaria, aunque algunos sectores críticos advierten que esto podría debilitar la capacidad de EE. UU. para mantener relaciones diplomáticas efectivas con otros países. La decisión llega en un momento de creciente tensión en varios frentes internacionales, incluido el conflicto con Rusia y la situación en Oriente Medio.

En una reciente intervención sobre los resultados electorales en Extremadura, Ayuso utilizó el escenario para reforzar su propio relato político, atacando al presidente Pedro Sánchez de forma personal y presentando su discurso como una constante lucha. Ayuso no se detuvo en los detalles de los resultados electorales ni en los retos reales de las comunidades autónomas, sino que se centró en posicionarse como la figura central de una polarización política. Su estilo se caracteriza por sustituir el debate y la reflexión por insultos y eslóganes vacíos, mientras alimenta la sensación de un país en crisis. Esta retórica, que ha sido una constante en sus intervenciones, parece tener como único objetivo movilizar a sus seguidores, reforzar trincheras y mantener la confrontación constante.

Estos países, principales receptores de emigrados ucranios, advierten que la fuga de jóvenes pone en peligro tanto la defensa como la reconstrucción de Ucrania. La política del presidente Zelenski, que permitió la salida de varones de entre 18 y 22 años para continuar sus estudios, ha resultado en una fuga masiva de jóvenes que evitan el alistamiento. A pesar de la ayuda que muchos reciben en países como Alemania, la situación es cada vez más insostenible para los gobiernos europeos. En este contexto, las perspectivas demográficas de Ucrania son preocupantes, con una disminución significativa de su población, que ha caído un 21% desde el inicio de la invasión rusa. Los expertos advierten que la crisis demográfica podría empeorar en el futuro y que la vuelta de los emigrados es incierta, lo que pone en peligro el futuro de Ucrania a largo plazo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-presion-de-europa-sobre-ucrania-para-frenar-la-emigracion-de-jovenes-hacia-paises-vecinos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-presion-de-europa-sobre-ucrania-para-frenar-la-emigracion-de-jovenes-hacia-paises-vecinos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Supremo investiga al eurodiputado Alvise Pérez por acoso a sus ex compañeros de lista]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo ha iniciado diligencias para investigar al eurodiputado Luis Pérez Fernández, conocido como 'Alvise', por presuntos delitos de acoso y revelación de secretos contra sus ex compañeros de la agrupación Se Acabó la Fiesta (SALF).

Su visión, basada en un análisis profundo de las contradicciones internas de la sociedad estadounidense, predice que la nación se encuentra en una crisis interna que podría llevar a su colapso. A través de su libro *America Against America*, Wang expone cómo la tensión entre el colectivismo y el individualismo, así como la mercantilización extrema de la sociedad, son factores que erosionan la cohesión interna de Estados Unidos. Además, propone que China, bajo el liderazgo de Xi Jinping, puede ofrecer una alternativa política que desafíe el modelo estadounidense.

Entre los afectados se encuentran empresas españolas, que enfrentarán un recargo del 28,6%, tras cooperar en la investigación. Esta decisión afecta a productos como quesos frescos, cuajadas y leche, con España como uno de los principales exportadores afectados. Las exportaciones de lácteos españoles a China fueron de unos 82 millones de euros en 2024, lo que hace que la medida tenga un impacto económico considerable. Además, la medida se enmarca en un contexto de creciente tensión comercial entre la UE y China, con la reciente disputa sobre los aranceles a los vehículos eléctricos.

NVIDIA asegura que el 94% de sus usuarios no superan ese límite, pero este cambio podría afectar a aquellos que juegan más de 3-4 horas al día. Para los usuarios más intensivos, se ofrecerán paquetes adicionales de 15 horas por 2,99 dólares en el plan Performance y 5,99 dólares en el plan Ultimate. Aunque el coste del servicio sigue siendo competitivo, este ajuste puede generar frustración, ya que los jugadores que ya pagan por un servicio de alta calidad preferirían tener acceso sin limitaciones.

Según la Sala del 61, la presencia de tres magistrados, incluido Andrés Martínez Arrieta, en cursos organizados por el ICAM durante las deliberaciones no constituye una conducta punible ni revela de forma directa e inequívoca el sentido condenatorio. La polémica se originó por unas declaraciones del ponente al final de su ponencia, en un curso para abogados, donde afirmó: “Concluyo, que tengo que poner la sentencia al fiscal general”. La querella argumentaba que esto indicaba una anticipación del fallo, pero el Supremo y la Fiscalía sostienen que las palabras no anticipan el resultado y que las decisiones en órganos colegiados son de todos los magistrados.

La familia ha confirmado que murió en un hospital tras una breve enfermedad. Rea, quien fusionó blues, pop, soul y soft rock a lo largo de su carrera, vendió más de 30 millones de discos y dejó un legado musical significativo, especialmente en España durante los años 80. Su estilo melódico y su profunda voz lo hicieron popular en las emisoras de radio dirigidas a un público adulto. Nació en Middlesbrough, Inglaterra, en 1951, y desde joven mostró interés por la música, trabajando en una heladería para poder comprar su primera guitarra. A pesar de enfrentarse a la irrupción del punk rock, logró varios éxitos en su carrera, destacando en Estados Unidos con su canción 'Fool (If You Think It’s Over)'.

Mientras el transporte por tren se volvía cada vez más puntual, las diferencias horarias entre poblaciones podían ser de hasta 45 minutos, como ocurría entre Barcelona y A Coruña. Este desajuste se convirtió en un desafío para el funcionamiento de los trenes, que necesitaban horarios más precisos para evitar accidentes. Fue así como se propuso la unificación de la hora, una medida que surgió en Inglaterra y que, poco a poco, fue adoptada en otros países. El sistema se basaba en el horario de Greenwich, que se convirtió en la referencia mundial. En España, la primera normativa se implementó en 1859, estableciendo que las estaciones ferroviarias debían ajustarse a la hora de Madrid. Este proceso, que comenzó con la sincronización de los relojes de las estaciones, culminó en 1900 con la adopción de un huso horario nacional. Así, el ferrocarril]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercadona pierde juicio por despido improcedente tras acusar a trabajadora de comer platos preparados]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una ex trabajadora de Mercadona ha conseguido que se declare improcedente su despido, después de ser acusada de consumir platos preparados al final de su jornada laboral.

El testimonio de dos excompañeras que aseguraban haber presenciado los hechos, así como fotografías de los presuntos restos de comida, fueron las pruebas presentadas por la empresa. Sin embargo, la trabajadora no reconoció los hechos y llevó a Mercadona a los tribunales, rechazando una oferta de 1.000 euros a cambio de admitir su culpabilidad. En el juicio, el Juzgado de lo Social de Terrassa consideró que las pruebas eran poco creíbles, ya que las declaraciones de las excompañeras no resultaron convincentes y existió un conflicto previo entre ellas.
