According to journalist Tim Weiner, author of 'The Mission,' the CIA had been anticipating military escalation since at least 2014, closely observing Russian military buildups and coded communications near the Ukrainian border. Rather than keeping these observations secret, the CIA and NSA opted for high-profile information disclosures between late 2021 and early 2022, aiming to deter Russian action and shape media narratives—what was referred to as 'preventive intelligence.' For the first time, intelligence reports typically reserved for the president were widely shared with the press and allies, showcasing details about troop movements and possible Russian operations.

Despite these efforts, analyst briefings and direct warnings to the Kremlin did not alter Moscow's plans.

The deployment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, with fears of a renewed arms race. These bombers, coming from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, are part of NATO's efforts to increase its influence near Russia's borders. The Pentagon has euphemistically described the mission as part of the 'Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1', a display of military might meant to reinforce deterrence on Europe's eastern flank. This comes shortly after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that Moscow is preparing nuclear tests in response to U.S. directives. The increasing military posturing follows remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump, who instructed the Department of Defense to resume nuclear testing, accusing Russia and China of conducting underground tests. In retaliation, President Vladimir Putin has warned that ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-b-52-bombers-arrive-in-spain-amid-rising-tensions-with-russia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-b-52-bombers-arrive-in-spain-amid-rising-tensions-with-russia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[BBC Newsroom Resignations Follow Controversy Over Trump Speech Edits; Typhoon Kalmaegi Hits Philippines]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article compiles global news highlights across multiple regions, focusing on political and international matters. It reports on BBC executives resigning after criticism of how a Trump speech was edited for broadcast, with the BBC noting that Trump has threatened to sue over the edited speech. The roundup also notes ongoing coverage of international conflicts, including the Israel-Hamas war and the Russia-Ukraine war. In addition, natural disaster news is featured, including a new typhoon striking the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Kalmaegi.

This incident is part of a growing trend of similar attacks on Russian diplomatic missions in Sweden, with more than 20 such attacks recorded since May of the previous year. The attacks typically involve drones dropping paint, often in glass containers, which poses a danger of injuries from shards or splashes. The Russian government has repeatedly condemned these actions, stressing that they violate the Vienna Convention of 1961, which obliges host nations to ensure the safety of foreign diplomatic missions. Despite these protests, Swedish authorities have failed to identify or prosecute any suspects, with investigations yielding no results. Russian officials argue that Sweden's inaction reflects a deliberate political stance and a violation of international agreements, as these attacks endanger both diplomatic staff and civilians living near the]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/drone-attack-targets-russian-commercial-mission-in-stockholm-amid-rising-tensions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/drone-attack-targets-russian-commercial-mission-in-stockholm-amid-rising-tensions</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coal Miners in West Virginia Struggle with Black Lung as Disease Rates Rise]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the coal mining heartland of West Virginia, a growing number of miners, including those in their 30s and 40s, are battling black lung disease, a condition once associated with older workers. Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist and director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, witnesses firsthand the increasing severity of the disease among miners, some of whom require double lung transplants by their mid-40s. As miners are forced to dig through more rock to access coal, they are being exposed to dangerous levels of respirable crystalline silica dust, which is causing rapid deterioration in their health. Despite efforts to protect miners through regulations by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, the risks remain high. Emery is deeply emotional about the plight of these miners and believes that she was put on earth to help them. The story sheds light on the human cost of coal mining, the increasing rates of black lung disease, and the struggles of a commu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/coal-miners-in-west-virginia-struggle-with-black-lung-as-disease-rates-rise</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/coal-miners-in-west-virginia-struggle-with-black-lung-as-disease-rates-rise</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Albania's EU bid amid deepening narcotics-linked corruption and state infiltration]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines Albania under Prime Minister Edi Rama, portraying a tight intertwining of politics, corruption, and organized crime. It highlights Rama’s government as pursuing European Union accession while facing accusations of widespread corruption and criminal infiltration within state institutions. The piece traces the career of ex-vice prime minister Arben Ahmetaj, his 2022 expulsion from the party, and his subsequent exile after facing corruption allegations linked to a controversial waste-to-energy project in Elbasan. It discusses how incinerators funded by public money became focal points for alleged graft, with two of three planned facilities completed and one abandoned after significant costs. The piece also covers broader criminal activity by Albanian networks, including cannabis production, drug trafficking, and money laundering, noting Europol and Italian authorities’ warnings about criminal groups with ties to government circles. It mentions the alleged connections ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albania-s-eu-bid-amid-deepening-narcotics-linked-corruption-and-state-infiltration</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albania-s-eu-bid-amid-deepening-narcotics-linked-corruption-and-state-infiltration</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 08:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Forces Advance Toward Pokrovsk Amid Extended Urban Combat]]></title><description><![CDATA[Russian forces are reportedly nearing the city of Pokrovsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region, with intensified urban fighting as surrounding troops have effectively besieged the city. A battalion commander cited by CNN described the situation as difficult, with firefights in urban areas and shelling from various weapons, while a Ukrainian drone unit member noted that Russian movement is so rapid that drone operators struggle to keep pace. The delay in Ukrainian command decisions is suggested to risk higher casualties, echoing past experiences in Batmut (2023) and Avdiivka (2024). Pokrovsk’s strategic importance lay in its road and rail connections to Donetsk, Kostyantynivka, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia, serving as a logistics hub for Ukrainian operations and supporting smaller settlements around the area. Since the summer, Russian siege efforts and drone/artillery strikes have pressured Kyiv to reroute supply lines, diminishing Pokrovsk’s logistical role and marking a tactical gain for Russia. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-forces-advance-toward-pokrovsk-amid-extended-urban-combat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-forces-advance-toward-pokrovsk-amid-extended-urban-combat</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 08:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump faces voter appeal on live TV as he touts affordability amid inflation concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a Fox News appearance by President Donald Trump, where he responded to Regina Foley, a three-time Trump voter who urged rapid cost-of-living relief. Foley’s on-air message emphasized struggles on groceries and utilities and warned Republicans about losing Congress in 2026. Trump replied by highlighting declining prices in energy and overall affordability, framing himself as sympathetic to Foley and insisting that prices would continue to fall as energy costs drop. The piece juxtaposes Trump’s claims with statistical context: gasoline averages around $3.12 per gallon (down 8% from 2024), electricity prices rising in multiple states, and grocery prices up year over year. It also cites polls showing disapproval of Trump for inflation and mixed assessments of affordability among the public. The article concludes by noting opinion polls and political implications, including Republicans’ concerns about grocery costs and ongoing national debates over inflation.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-faces-voter-appeal-on-live-tv-as-he-touts-affordability-amid-inflation-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-faces-voter-appeal-on-live-tv-as-he-touts-affordability-amid-inflation-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump grants pardons to allies connected to efforts to overturn 2020 election]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump issued a broad set of pardons to a number of political allies who were connected to efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election. The pardon proclamation, publicly shared by Ed Martin, the Pardon Attorney, on social media, lists prominent figures including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, among many others. The document describes the pardons as a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” and states that they apply to federal offenses, not to state or local charges. The proclamation asserts that the pardons rectify a national injustice and contribute to national reconciliation. Some recipients were co-defendants implicated in legal actions in Georgia related to attempts to undermine Trump’s 2020 loss. The White House and Martin’s office have been contacted for additional information. In a related move, Trump granted clemency to a retired New York City police officer convicted in 2023 of stalki]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-grants-pardons-to-allies-connected-to-efforts-to-overturn-2020-election</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-grants-pardons-to-allies-connected-to-efforts-to-overturn-2020-election</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Experts and Critics Slam Trump's Proposal for 50-Year Mortgages]]></title><description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's proposal for a 50-year mortgage plan has sparked significant backlash from experts, analysts, and social media users alike. The former president recently hinted at the plan, which administration officials later confirmed. Critics argue that such a proposal would significantly increase the total cost of a home, trapping buyers in debt for much of their lives. For example, a $400,000 house on a 30-year mortgage at 6% interest would cost the buyer around $863,000, but under Trump's 50-year plan, that cost would rise to $1.38 million—half a million more in interest. The idea was labeled a 'spectacularly dumb' move by many, with political figures and commentators pointing out that it would benefit banks while worsening the financial burden on Americans. Others expressed frustration over Trump's perceived lack of understanding regarding housing affordability, and some critics even stated they regretted voting for him, citing the proposal as a prime example of his detachment fr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experts-and-critics-slam-trump-s-proposal-for-50-year-mortgages</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experts-and-critics-slam-trump-s-proposal-for-50-year-mortgages</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alleged Torture and Abuse of Palestinians in Israeli Detention Centers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Israeli military prosecutor, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, was arrested and removed from her position after leaking a video exposing the torture of Palestinian prisoners at the Sde Teiman concentration camp. This military base in the Negev Desert, close to Gaza, was converted into a detention and torture center after the passage of the 2023 Illegal Fighters Law. Detainees, often arrested arbitrarily, are subjected to severe physical and psychological abuse. Human rights organizations like B'Tselem have highlighted various forms of torture used against Palestinian prisoners, including sexual violence, physical assault, and deprivation of basic needs such as medical care and proper hygiene. The torture practices at Sde Teiman have been compared to those at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib. Additionally, Palestinian medical personnel have been detained and abused under similar conditions. These acts are considered violations of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, and have led ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alleged-torture-and-abuse-of-palestinians-in-israeli-detention-centers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/alleged-torture-and-abuse-of-palestinians-in-israeli-detention-centers</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 06:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ODF 1.4 Launch Celebrates Two Decades of OpenDocument Standard Enhancements]]></title><description><![CDATA[ODF 1.4 marks a milestone in the OpenDocument Format’s history, celebrating its 20th anniversary under the OASIS Open umbrella.

The device mimics Biden's signature and has allegedly been used for pardons, appointments, and executive orders. The article claims that Biden’s cognitive decline was evident, and his administration allegedly covered it up. It highlights a congressional investigation that questions Biden's ability to govern and the legality of decisions made under his name. Testimonies, including from his former chief of staff, Ron Klain, suggest Biden struggled with basic tasks, including debate preparations. The report calls for further scrutiny of Biden's health and the actions of his closest aides. The situation raises concerns about constitutional issues, especially regarding pardons and executive orders signed with the autopen.

Sentinel-1D, a C-band SAR Earth observation satellite built by Thales Alenia Space for the European Space Agency on the PRIMA platform, weighs 2184 kg and features a 12.3-meter deployable SAR antenna capable of up to 5-meter resolution. The satellite includes five panels and 280 transmitter/receiver modules, with an instrument AIS for maritime traffic monitoring. Its mission life is estimated at 7.5 years, with propellant capacity for 12 years, and it uses 14 propulsion motors. The article explains how Sentinel-1D will operate in the same orbital plane as Sentinel-1C to maximize revisit times, and contrasts prior Sentinel-1A/B lifecycles, noting the prolonged gaps caused by satellite outages and launch vehicle issues.

The joint operations hub, allegedly headquartered in Saudi Arabia, allegedly coordinated sabotage and espionage against Yemen by forming small, independent cells directly connected to it. These cells were equipped with advanced surveillance equipment to conduct missions including surveillance, photography, and the collection of coordinates and information. Members reportedly received training from American, Israeli, and Saudi officers in Saudi Arabia.

These fake agents have been involved in several violent crimes, including robberies, kidnappings, and sexual assaults. The FBI has reported at least five such incidents in 2025 and is urging law enforcement to ensure officers clearly identify themselves during operations. The rise in impersonation crimes has raised concerns about public trust in law enforcement, especially in vulnerable communities. The FBI's advisory calls for coordination at all levels of government to distinguish real ICE operations from fakes. It also highlights the need for agencies to cooperate with civilians who request verification, such as allowing calls to local precincts. These impersonators are exploiting the heightened profile of ICE, using forged credentials, mismatched gear, and cloned vehicle markings.

It highlights Conrad Schumann as the first known escapee and emphasizes that, over 28 years, many attempted to flee to the West using diverse methods. A significant focus is placed on underground tunnels as one of the most romantic and successful escape routes. Early tunnels emerged within weeks, such as one dug from West Berlin into the Pankow cemetery to rescue girlfriends, followed by others like the Niebank couple who leveraged a visa system to plan a move to the West. The narrative covers multiple tunnels built by locals, including the famous Tunnel 29, constructed by students and Italian collaborators, which enabled 130+ people to reach the West.

The English world number one described the match as one of the strangest games he had ever been involved in, adding that the victory was a testament to the unpredictable nature of darts. Humphries, who needs three legs from his final group match to progress, remarked on the unexpected nature of the game and his surprise at hitting the nine-darter. In other matches, reigning champion Luke Littler continued his strong performance with a 5-3 win over Connor Scutt, while Michael van Gerwen suffered a surprising 5-4 loss to Niko Springer, missing 15 darts at double.

The match, held in Ottawa, was played amidst a fierce blizzard with temperatures dropping to -8°C. The snowstorm caused repeated delays, with players clearing the pitch, goalkeepers using shovels, and a snowplough making an appearance before extra time. Despite the extreme weather, Atletico Ottawa clinched their inaugural North Star Cup with a 2-1 extra-time victory. The match saw Fraser Aird give Cavalry the lead with a 33rd-minute penalty, celebrated by a snow-slide before being pelted with snowballs by the home fans. However, David Rodriguez of Atletico Ottawa would steal the show, scoring a bicycle kick that deflected off the bar to level the match, followed by a chip over Cavalry's goalkeeper Marco Carducci in extra time to secure the win.

This decision is part of the company's ongoing plan to move away from Fujitsu as it seeks a new supplier. The Horizon software has been at the heart of a major scandal, with hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongfully convicted of fraud and theft due to errors in the system. Despite Fujitsu executives acknowledging a 'moral obligation' to contribute financially to the victims of the scandal, the company has yet to settle on a final amount. The Post Office is committed to moving to a new system and has set a timeline to award a contract for a new supplier by July 2026.

The shutdown, triggered by a political deadlock over healthcare spending, has affected millions of Americans. On Sunday night, senators passed a procedural vote to advance a bill that will be amended to fund the government until January 30, 2026. The agreement comes after months of disruptions, including the suspension of federal services and the furlough of employees. The shutdown, the first in nearly seven years, was a result of partisan divisions between Democrats and Republicans. The proposed bill will also prevent federal agencies from firing employees until January 30, a win for unions representing federal workers.

The operation, known as Operation Baselife, was part of a broader effort by the Metropolitan Police to address anti-social behavior, shoplifting, phone theft, and violence against women ahead of the busy Christmas period. Among those arrested was a man who filmed women in a coffee shop, as well as two men attempting to steal mobile phones at an ice rink. Additionally, a stolen vehicle was intercepted with a stinger, and its occupants were arrested for car theft and drug possession. The police deployed more than 100 officers, and used advanced technology like facial recognition to assist in the operation. Superintendent Natasha Evans emphasized that this intelligence-led approach is yielding positive results, such as doubling the number of solved shoplifting cases.

Spearheaded by Jon Prideaux, former CEO of Boku, and Martin Graham, ex-AIM head, the initiative aims to revive public markets for growth companies by attracting capital from venture funds that predominantly invest in private businesses. The plan proposes eliminating fund management fees and carried interest, offering to provide half of eligible companies’ capital needs to incentivize participation. Prideaux emphasized that the public markets stopped working for growth companies years ago and stated that the GGM intends to reconnect companies and capital to the public markets with a more favorable deal for both sides.

Officials report that the workforce is already short by hundreds of controllers, with about 730,000 federal employees affected by a pay halt since October 1. The resignations exacerbate existing bottlenecks at major airports, forcing agencies to implement reductions of air traffic in high-traffic markets. Controllers coping with burnout are calling in sick and expressing concerns about paying essential expenses, including gas and childcare. Some workers have even taken second jobs, despite warnings from officials to avoid compromising safety. Transportation Secretary and other leaders acknowledge the mounting fatigue and stress among staff who continue to report to duty for six days a week, long hours, and increasing fatigue.

Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who returned to power in 2022, there has been a concerted effort to address the rising levels of forest clearing, which had been largely unchecked during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. Deforestation in the Amazon is at its lowest level in over a decade, a major factor in the significant reduction in emissions. A new report from the Climate Observatory shows that Brazilian emissions fell by 16.7% in the past year. The decline highlights the impact of federal enforcement against illegal activities by miners, loggers, and farmers who destroy forests for land expansion. While Lula aims to eliminate illegal deforestation by the end of the decade, the country still faces the challenge of widespread fires, which, despite the reductions in deforestation, continue to threaten forest preservation. In 2023, fires were ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/brazil-sees-major-drop-in-emissions-following-crackdown-on-deforestation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/brazil-sees-major-drop-in-emissions-following-crackdown-on-deforestation</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fuel Blockade and External Interventions Deepen Mali's Humanitarian Crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mali is currently facing a major humanitarian crisis due to a persistent fuel blockade that has lasted several weeks. Jihadist groups, particularly JNIM (affiliated with Al Qaeda), have targeted fuel-carrying trucks coming from neighboring countries, escalating by stealing vehicles and kidnapping drivers. This has resulted in a critical shortage of fuel throughout Mali, causing severe disruptions in transportation, electricity supply, and economic activity, especially in the central and southern regions and in the capital, Bamako. Only one out of ten gas stations in Bamako remained operational by late October, with long lines and people waiting overnight for fuel, as attacks continued despite military escorts. The jihadists justify their blockade as a reaction to government policies that limit fuel deliveries to villages cooperating with them, but have now expanded into a nationwide embargo in an attempt to undermine the military-led government, which came to power in 2021.

This unusual display raised concerns and prompted further media coverage. The event, part of a broader initiative aimed at addressing healthcare costs, highlighted the challenges Trump faces while balancing his public duties. While the president’s apparent fatigue during the event captured attention, there was no official explanation provided for his behavior at that time. The footage, which was widely shared across social media platforms, sparked a mix of reactions, with some expressing concern for his well-being, while others speculated about the reasons behind his drowsiness.

The multilayered web spans over 100 square meters along a cave wall near the entrance and houses roughly 69,000 Tegenaria domestica (domestic house spiders) and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans. This appears to be the first reported instance of colonial web formation for both species, traditionally solitary. Investigations by the Czech Speleological Society and collaborators began in 2022, with DNA barcoding and morphological analyses confirming the two species and revealing unexpected cohabitation. Colony size was estimated by counting funnel webs in random sections and extrapolating density, then calculating surface area. The study found that the cave environment, which lacks sunlight and contains hydrogen sulfide, supports a food web powered by sulfur-oxidizing microbes.

This change marks a move toward considering personal character alongside academic achievements in admissions decisions. The rejected students had applied through the regular admissions route, and although they had outstanding scores on the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), their disciplinary histories related to bullying led to their disqualification. The new policy follows a 2023 scandal where public outrage over the leniency shown to an applicant with a bullying history pushed for stricter measures.

Epstein, a convicted sex trafficker, operated with apparent immunity, including a controversial 2007 legal deal that protected him and his clients from prosecution. The article also highlights the role of wealthy figures like Les Wexner, whose connections to Epstein enabled his rise, as well as his links to powerful groups like the 'Mega Group,' a circle of prominent Jewish American businessmen.

The march, presented by Morocco as a peaceful, religiously driven demonstration, was supported by tens of thousands of Moroccan civilians. It was intended to force Spain to relinquish control of the territory, leading to a division of Western Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania. Despite the peaceful façade, the operation was heavily orchestrated by the Moroccan military, and its ultimate goal was the annexation of Western Sahara. The author argues that the true nature of the march was a betrayal of the Sahrawi people, who were left without their right to self-determination. The article also critiques the subsequent political and military developments, including the failed UN-backed negotiations for a referendum, and highlights the long-lasting struggle of the Sahrawi people for independence.

One key advantage for China is its significantly cheaper electricity costs, which give it an edge in training large AI models. While U.S. companies still dominate in high-performance chips like Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s MI300, China’s investments in both digital and analog chips are paying off. Analog chips, which are more energy-efficient and cheaper to produce, are becoming a strategic asset, particularly in industrial AI applications. Additionally, China’s dominance in rare earth elements and its ability to manage critical materials for AI production further strengthen its position. The rise of open-source AI models from China is also challenging U.S. models, with Chinese companies gaining tracti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-gains-ground-in-the-global-ai-race-as-the-u-s-faces-structural-challenges</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-gains-ground-in-the-global-ai-race-as-the-u-s-faces-structural-challenges</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 09:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[DRAM Prices Skyrocket 171% Due to AI Demand and Ongoing Shortage]]></title><description><![CDATA[DRAM prices have experienced an extraordinary 171.8% increase year-over-year as of Q3 2025, driven largely by demand from the AI industry. The price hike is so severe that it now outpaces the recent increase in gold prices. This surge is the result of memory manufacturers prioritizing server-grade memory types such as RDIMM and HBM for AI applications, which has reduced the availability of consumer-focused DDR5 memory. As a consequence, mainstream DDR5 prices are now about double what they were in July 2025. Retailers like Newegg are reflecting these price increases, with products like Corsair's Vengeance DDR5 kit rising from $91 in July to $183. Experts predict this trend will continue for the next few years, with DRAM shortages expected to worsen by 2026. This is not isolated to DRAM, as NAND flash and hard drive prices are also climbing due to high demand for AI server components.

These recruits are primarily motivated by the financial compensation, with many lacking prior military experience. A few Spanish-speaking Ukrainian instructors are tasked with training them in combat tactics. The pay for these foreign recruits is just under 3,000 euros per month, and unlike Ukrainian soldiers, they can terminate their contracts at any time. Following the outbreak of the war in February 2022, Ukraine issued a global call for volunteers to join their ranks, leading to the enlistment of about 8,000 mercenaries from various countries, with 40% reportedly coming from South America. Initially, only individuals with prior military experience were accepted, but as the war progressed, Ukraine relaxed these requirements.

Known as the 'Angel of Mercy,' she was a symbol of hope for Palestinians and was revered for her tireless humanitarian work. Despite her clear identification as a medical worker, the Israeli military claimed she was a threat or used as a human shield, but a UN investigation concluded otherwise, affirming her murder was intentional. Her death, which occurred just before her engagement to her fiancé, drew international outrage and made her a martyr for the Palestinian cause. The article also discusses the failure of Israel's investigation and the role of international officials, like former British Minister Alistair Burt, who later admitted his mistake in downplaying her death as a war crime.

The sculpture, which survived from a shipwreck, is an extraordinary example of Greek artistry and is on display at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The piece is known for its expressive portrayal of both the horse and the boy in the heat of a race, showcasing dramatic details such as the horse’s strained body language and the boy’s fatigued expression. The artwork combines Greek classical ideals with added emotion, energy, and realism, typical of Hellenistic sculpture. The statue is unique not only because of its remarkable condition but also due to its survival when most ancient bronzes were melted down. The artist's identity remains unknown, but theories suggest it may have been looted during the Achaean War. The boy, likely of mixed heritage, adds to the statue's symbolic depth.

Descendants disclosed that the diamond was stored in a Canadian bank vault under Empress Zita's orders during World War II and had remained there all along, despite public belief in its disappearance. The reveal follows a broader controversy surrounding royal jewels that captured global attention, including a Louvre heist that brought renewed interest to missing artefacts. According to family accounts, after escaping Nazi persecution to Canada, the Habsburgs kept the Florentine secure with other jewellery, revealing its location only to Zita's sons and later to their own children for security until 100 years after Charles I’s death in 1922. Several relatives confirmed the story to major outlets, and the family now contemplates publicly exhibiting the diamond as a gesture of appreciation to Canada for sheltering the former monarch's kin.

Titanium offered notable advantages, including lighter weight, resistance to seawater corrosion, and non-magnetic properties, making Soviet submarines like the Alfa and Sierra classes harder to detect by Western sonar and capable of diving to depths around a thousand meters. The Alfa class, introduced in the 1970s, featured a lead-bismuth reactor enabling speeds exceeding 76 km/h underwater and was designed to threaten aircraft carriers, forcing the U.S. Navy to develop new antisubmarine weapons such as the Mark 48 torpedo. Titanium submarines formed a core part of the USSR’s tactical nuclear arsenal, often carrying nuclear-tipped torpedoes for naval battles rather than strategic land strikes. Some larger classes carried nuclear cruise missiles for ground attacks, notably the Papa (Project 661 Anchar), nicknamed “]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titanium-submarines-soviet-engineering-and-the-cold-war-undersea-race</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titanium-submarines-soviet-engineering-and-the-cold-war-undersea-race</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City Mayor, Defeating Cuomo and Sliwa]]></title><description><![CDATA[Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, has won the 2025 New York City mayoral race, becoming the youngest mayor in a century. Mamdani’s victory marks the culmination of a rapid political rise, having gone from a little-known state assemblyman to leading America's largest city. He defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as a third-party candidate, by about 9 points. Mamdani’s platform includes ambitious policies such as freezing rent on rent-stabilized apartments, enacting universal child care, and launching city-run grocery stores. His victory speech focused on combating authoritarianism and oligarchy, with a strong challenge to former President Donald Trump.

The attack involved a group of 11 individuals, many of whom were armed with military-grade equipment, who ambushed the facility, shooting one officer in the neck. These charges are the first-ever to be brought against individuals under the designation of Antifa as a terrorist organization. The Trump administration classified Antifa as a terrorist group in a September executive order, citing their involvement in political violence. However, experts like Dr. Todd Sandler, an economist and terrorism expert, caution that labeling Antifa as a terrorist organization is problematic.

These operations, using U.S. supplied Black Hawk helicopters, aimed to infiltrate Russian-controlled areas and extract CIA-linked officers. However, both missions were detected by Russian drones and ended in failure, with Ukrainian special forces being killed in the process. The CIA has been deeply involved with the GUR since the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, providing extensive training and equipment. The relationship between the CIA and GUR has led to some of Ukraine's most daring operations.

Greene, a Bible-believing Christian, explained that she believes demons, including those in UFO phenomena, may be fallen angels who were cast out of heaven. Her comments have once again sparked debates surrounding her controversial positions, including past involvement in conspiracy theories. During the interview, Greene also discussed a controversial 2018 post where she suggested that California wildfires were caused by space lasers under the control of the Rothschild banking dynasty, a theory that has been widely criticized for its antisemitic undertones. Greene admitted that she was unaware of the Jewish identity of the Rothschild family at the time. Despite her past controversies, Greene has recently found some unlikely bipartisan support, especially on issues like healthcare and]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marjorie-taylor-greene-speculates-that-ufos-might-be-related-to-fallen-angels</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marjorie-taylor-greene-speculates-that-ufos-might-be-related-to-fallen-angels</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 08:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Historical Context of the Revolt in Flanders Against Spanish Rule]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article delves into the complex historical and political situation of Flanders during the reign of Emperor Charles V and King Philip II of Spain. It explains that the territories in the Low Countries were not politically united and maintained their own local power structures. The nobles, who held significant power, were at odds with Spanish rule due to religious and political differences, including heavy taxation and the influence of the Inquisition. As tensions grew, many Dutch elites and Calvinists presented their struggle as a fight for freedom against Spanish oppression, despite the fact that the majority of the population remained Catholic. The article argues that the rebellion was driven more by local political interests and elite rivalry rather than a widespread popular uprising. Over time, propaganda painted the conflict as a religious and political battle, while the military confrontation evolved into a prolonged, fragmented conflict that became the Eighty Years' War.

De esas personas, al menos 2.613 serían víctimas de la represión franquista. Aunque existen fondos ya aprobados por varias administraciones, el proyecto de exhumación está paralizado por la falta de iniciativa del gobierno municipal del PP, que no ha incluido las partidas necesarias en los presupuestos de 2026. A pesar de los compromisos adquiridos por el Gobierno central y la Junta de Andalucía, el retraso del Ayuntamiento de Sevilla está poniendo en peligro los plazos establecidos para completar la exhumación antes de 2029. La falta de un proyecto por parte del Consistorio impide que lleguen los fondos de otras administraciones, lo que podría hacer que se redirijan a otras iniciativas relacionadas con la memoria histórica.

Campos, periodista de la Cadena SER, relató que pudo leer fragmentos del correo el 13 de marzo por la tarde, aunque afirmó que el fío no autorizó su publicación y que no era fuente del fiscal general.

Marhuenda argumentó que TVE está promoviendo una campaña en contra del político gallego, presentándolo como un líder incapaz de controlar su partido, el PP, y de tomar decisiones firmes en momentos clave. Según Marhuenda, esta actitud responde a la influencia de un aparato propagandístico alineado con el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. La crítica se enmarca en un momento de alta tensión política, donde el PP se encuentra en negociaciones con Vox para formar gobierno en la Comunidad Valenciana tras la dimisión de Carlos Mazón. Marhuenda también reflexionó sobre la difícil situación en la que se encuentra Feijóo, que, a pesar de su necesidad de llegar a acuerdos con Vox, se ve atacado por la cobertura mediática.

La causa se cerró después de que la menor, que es de origen romaní, declarara que su traslado fue voluntario y con el consentimiento de sus padres. Según su testimonio, no hubo ningún tipo de coerción, lo que llevó al juez a considerar su declaración como la principal evidencia para archivar el caso. Los padres de la menor, detenidos inicialmente por vender a su hija por 5.000 euros y otros bienes, fueron puestos en libertad. La menor había sido localizada en Lleida, donde se encontraba mendigando, y fue llevada a un centro de protección. La operación fue realizada por la Guardia Civil y los Mossos d’Esquadra, tras una denuncia de Servicios Sociales.

Sin embargo, el catedrático de Filosofía del Derecho Ramón Soriano desmiente estas afirmaciones, señalando que el Gobierno de Sánchez cumple con los requisitos constitucionales para su legitimidad de origen y ejercicio. Soriano explica que la Constitución Española establece claramente cómo deben entenderse ambos tipos de legitimidad y argumenta que el rechazo a convocar una cuestión de confianza no implica ilegitimidad, ya que esta herramienta es de libre disposición del presidente.

Su mandato, que comenzó en 2011, ha sido calificado por muchos de 'neoliberal', priorizando los beneficios económicos sobre la labor social y evangelizadora. Esta actitud ha provocado múltiples enfrentamientos con el clero, organizaciones sociales y víctimas de su gestión. Además, las críticas no solo provienen de los trabajadores despedidos, sino también de sacerdotes como Rafael Vez, quien tras denunciar públicamente los abusos de poder de Zornoza, fue suspendido de sus funciones por más de cuatro años.

Según ALA, el ICAM, presidido por Eugenio Ribón, ha mostrado un protagonismo desmesurado al personarse en el caso como acusación popular, pidiendo penas de cárcel para el fiscal sin justificación. La denuncia se centra en la filtración de un correo relacionado con el novio de la presidenta madrileña, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, y la posterior actuación de la Junta del ICAM, que ha sido vista como un intento de defender los intereses de dicha persona. ALA también critica que el ICAM haya insinuado una conexión política con la Moncloa en relación a la filtración, algo que no se corresponde con los hechos del caso.

La violencia comenzó con un asedio prolongado a la ciudad, que culminó en octubre con la toma de su base militar. En videos grabados por los propios milicianos, se muestran ejecuciones de prisioneros desarmados, tanto hombres como mujeres, y la celebración del genocidio por parte de los combatientes. La comunidad internacional, incluida la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI), investiga posibles crímenes de guerra y crímenes contra la humanidad. La milicia FAR, que tiene su origen en el infame grupo Janjaweed, ha sido acusada de atrocidades durante años, especialmente en Darfur. Tras la caída de El Fasher, comenzaron a circular imágenes que evidencian masacres y ejecuciones, algunos de los cuales se documentaron a través de imágenes satelitales.

La noticia subraya que la combinación de bajas, bajas temporales y desafíos de reclutamiento ha reducido la plantilla disponible para operaciones y entrenamiento, lo que podría limitar la capacidad de la región para responder de forma rápida y coordinada ante incidentes en la frontera norte. Además, el informe analiza factores como la rotación de personal, la modernización de equipamiento y las presiones internas que impactan en la disponibilidad de tropas. En este contexto, se destacan posibles escenarios de escalada y la necesidad de estrategias de refuerzo y reserva para mantener disuasión y seguridad nacional.

La investigación incluye vehículos de marcas como Kia, Tesla y Volvo, que destacan por la buena conservación de sus baterías. Además, el estudio pone en evidencia cómo la gestión adecuada de la temperatura, el software de carga y los hábitos de uso pueden alargar la vida útil de las baterías, mejorando la autonomía y reduciendo el impacto ambiental. El análisis también subraya que los coches eléctricos de segunda mano, con baterías en buen estado, se posicionan como una opción más fiable y económica para los consumidores, lo que podría beneficiar tanto a los conductores como al medio ambiente.

El Ayuntamiento, liderado por Izquierda Unida en coalición con el PSOE, ha establecido un protocolo que permite a los vecinos autorizar al consistorio para representarlos judicialmente y solicitar medidas cautelares, incluida la orden de alejamiento. Este enfoque surge como respuesta a un notable incremento en los robos con fuerza en viviendas, registrando un aumento del 95,6% en el segundo trimestre de 2025, y busca salvaguardar a la ciudadanía ante delincuentes habituales. El procedimiento, denominado protocolo exprés, facilita que la víctima acuda a la Guardia Civil para denunciar y, con la autorización municipal, que los servicios jurídicos gestionen todo el proceso, desde la denuncia hasta la petición de medidas ante el juez.

Otro caso similar afecta a un modelo de altavoz Vieta Party 11, cuyo precio marcado como rebajado es también más alto que el anterior.

Jean Carroll. El caso se originó por una presunta agresión ocurrida a mediados de los años 90 en una tienda de Nueva York, y Trump negó las acusaciones, calificándolas de inventos para dañar su imagen política y comercial. En 2024, una corte federal confirmó el veredicto y la sentencia, descartando errores que justificaran un nuevo juicio, pese a que el juez permitió testimonios de varias testigos y la difusión de un video de Access Hollywood que supuso un elemento clave en la difusión de las acusaciones. Trump sostiene que el juez cometió numerosos errores al permitir ciertas pruebas y que Carroll tardó más de dos décadas en presentar la acusación, lo que, en su opinión, minaría la credibilidad de las denuncias.

Dos afectados, Ramón Merino y Pablo Gutiérrez, han presentado una querella contra un agente de la Policía Municipal de Madrid, al que acusan de detenciones arbitrarias, coacciones y abuso de autoridad. A pesar de que las causas contra ellos fueron archivadas, los empresarios denuncian que estas actuaciones ilegales han afectado gravemente a sus negocios, provocando el cierre de algunas tiendas.

Se detalla el contexto de precariedad económica, descontento social y la caída del Segundo Imperio, que impulsaron a obreros, artesanos y vecinos a organizarse. Las barricadas emergen como elementos centrales de la resistencia física y del poder popular, construidas con adoquines, mobiliario y vigas, y elevadas en barrios como Belleville, Montmartre y el Marais. Estas estructuras variaban desde simples acumulaciones de piedras hasta fortificaciones con troneras para fusiles, reflejo de la supremacía numérica del ejército de Versalles y la necesidad de conocimiento del terreno urbano. Durante la Semana Sangrienta (21-28 de mayo de 1871), las barricadas fueron el último refugio de la Comuna, enfrentando la artillería y el fuego de fusil hasta su caída.

La ley, que aún debe ser aprobada en dos lecturas más, ha generado controversia, especialmente por su aplicación retroactiva, lo que podría permitir la ejecución de cientos de palestinos detenidos desde el 7 de octubre de 2023. Organizaciones de derechos humanos denuncian que esta medida podría ser usada para legitimar 'ejecuciones masivas' y acusan al gobierno israelí de promover una ley más orientada a la venganza que a la disuasión.

Un ejemplo claro es la planta de baterías de CATL en Figueruelas, Zaragoza, donde el personal empleado para su construcción proviene mayoritariamente de China, lo que genera inquietud sobre el futuro del empleo local.

Este hecho conmocionó a la comunidad y desató una ola de indignación que llevó al Consejo General del Poder Judicial (CGPJ) a revisar los delitos de escándalo público y desacato. Pese a las manifestaciones en la localidad, el juez que instruyó el caso, Antonio Navarro Castillo, no enfrentó medidas disciplinarias. La tragedia provocó una reflexión sobre la legislación y la moral de la época, aunque fue demasiado tarde para evitar la tragedia que marcó la vida de ambos jóvenes.

Luque destacó que, sin un plan hidrológico adecuado, el país podría perder el liderazgo mundial en producción de aceite de oliva. A pesar de la reciente mejora de la cosecha gracias a las lluvias de la primavera, la producción de aceite en España sigue siendo insuficiente y está por debajo de los niveles esperados.

La misión fue realizada por el cohete Ariane 62, la cuarta vez que este lanzador se utilizaba con éxito. El Sentinel-1D está diseñado para monitorizar el terreno mediante radar SAR en banda C, y ayudará a completar la constelación inicial de los satélites Sentinel-1. Su órbita tiene una inclinación de 98,2º, y su vida útil estimada es de 7,5 años, aunque tiene propelentes para 12 años. Este lanzamiento se produce en un contexto en el que Europa busca consolidar su autosuficiencia espacial con los lanzadores Ariane y Vega, aunque la decisión de utilizar un lanzador tan potente y caro como el Ariane 62 ha generado controversia, ya que el Sentinel-1D es relativamente ligero en comparación con la capacidad de carga del cohete. Este evento marca un hito importante para el programa Copérnico, y la ESA se prepara ahora para fut]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-lanzamiento-del-sentinel-1d-un-paso-mas-para-europa-en-los-satelites-de-observacion-terrestre</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-lanzamiento-del-sentinel-1d-un-paso-mas-para-europa-en-los-satelites-de-observacion-terrestre</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La burbuja de la IA: ¿un riesgo para la economía global?]]></title><description><![CDATA[El despliegue de la inteligencia artificial (IA) en Estados Unidos está generando señales claras de una burbuja económica. Las grandes tecnológicas estadounidenses han comprometido miles de millones de dólares en infraestructura de IA, aunque los beneficios aún no se reflejan en sus ingresos. Esta inversión masiva en centros de datos podría transformar el mercado, pero también plantea riesgos si la rentabilidad de la IA no es tan alta como se espera. La situación recuerda a las burbujas tecnológicas del pasado, como la burbuja puntocom o la crisis de las hipotecas subprime. Aunque el auge de la IA ha impulsado la economía estadounidense, su sostenibilidad es incierta. Las grandes empresas tecnológicas, como Meta, Microsoft y Amazon, están invirtiendo billones de dólares en centros de datos, pero aún no han obtenido retornos significativos. Si la IA no logra generar los beneficios necesarios para cubrir estos gastos, la burbuja podría estallar, provocando una crisis económica que afecta]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-burbuja-de-la-ia-un-riesgo-para-la-economia-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-burbuja-de-la-ia-un-riesgo-para-la-economia-global</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 11:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla revisará su IA tras incidente en el que pidió fotos desnudas a un menor]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe un incidente relacionado con la IA integrada en vehículos Tesla, donde un chatbot conversacional supuestamente pidio a un menor de edad que enviara fotos desnudas.

Este acto no fue solo una decisión política, sino una necesidad impuesta por las circunstancias de la época, marcadas por la invasión napoleónica. Desde el comienzo de la guerra en 1808, las transformaciones políticas en España llevaron a la aparición de ideas y debates políticos que, hasta entonces, solo eran conocidos por una pequeña élite intelectual. Aunque el reconocimiento legal de la libertad de imprenta no ocurrió hasta 1810, en la práctica ya se había estado llevando a cabo durante dos años debido a la imposibilidad de controlar todos los materiales escritos en tiempos de guerra. Este avance representó un cambio significativo en la historia política y cultural de España, marcando un hito en la historia de la libertad de expresión en el país.

La mujer, originaria de Avilés, fue apuñalada y enterrada en cal viva en Langreo, tras ser asesinada por un camionero. El crimen ocurrió el 6 de enero de 1991, pero la desaparición de la joven no fue denunciada hasta 1995. El asesino, un hombre de La Felguera, confesó tras ser delatado por su pareja, aunque siempre negó conocer a la víctima. Según su relato, recogió a la joven cuando hacía autostop y, tras un intento de robo por parte de ella, la apuñaló y la enterró en cal viva junto a su pareja. La investigación se reactivó en 2023 gracias al análisis de ADN, lo que permitió identificar los restos de la joven. Este caso, que inicialmente fue un misterio, ahora ha llegado a su resolución después de más de tres décadas de búsqueda.

Se describe cómo Trump ha privilegiado a un núcleo de confianza, desplazando al establishment y promoviendo una narrativa de renacer ante cambios económicos y geopolíticos. Se destacan cambios en la estructura interna del partido, con una mayor influencia de activistas de base y una reducción de espacios para la disidencia, así como la ascensión de figuras leales que ejecutan estratégicamente las políticas del presidente. El texto también aborda las tensiones internas entre distintas corrientes dentro de MAGA, desde posiciones más religiosas hasta enfoques más seculares, y las fricciones con antiguos republicanos que cuestionan políticas de comercio, alianzas internacionales y apoyo a Ucrania.

En particular, se refiere a Pablo Iglesias, al que considera una figura polémica dentro de la política española, criticando que un político consulte a sus bases si debe comprarse un chalé.

Las sanciones, que pueden ser comerciales, financieras y tecnológicas, buscan debilitar las economías de los países objetivo, pero tienen consecuencias devastadoras para los ciudadanos inocentes. Según estudios, estas medidas han causado millones de muertes, principalmente entre niños y personas mayores, a lo largo de las últimas décadas. A pesar de su brutalidad, las sanciones rara vez logran los objetivos políticos de cambio de régimen o modificación de comportamientos, lo que convierte a estas medidas en una forma de crueldad innecesaria y dañina. En particular, el embargo de Estados Unidos a Cuba, que lleva más de 65 años en vigor, ilustra cómo las sanciones económicas se aplican sin tener en cuenta el sufrimiento humano, sin generar los cambios prometidos.

La llamada 'Línea Amarilla', una franja de seguridad creada por Israel en Gaza, ha sido un punto de conflicto, con varios palestinos muertos por cruzarla, sin que se haya ofrecido claridad sobre su trazado. Además, el gobierno israelí ha obstaculizado la entrada de suministros esenciales como alimentos, medicinas y materiales de refugio, lo que ha empeorado aún más la situación en la Franja. La comunidad internacional, junto con organizaciones humanitarias, ha exigido una mayor intervención para aliviar la crisis. En Cisjordania, los ataques de las fuerzas israelíes y de los colonos continúan, con más de 2.400 incidentes violentos en octubre. La violencia y las políticas represivas del Estado israelí siguen siendo un tema central de debate y condena a nivel internacional.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-sigue-violando-el-alto-el-fuego-y-asesina-a-civiles-palestinos-en-gaza-y-cisjordania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-sigue-violando-el-alto-el-fuego-y-asesina-a-civiles-palestinos-en-gaza-y-cisjordania</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sonic GX para GX4000: después de siete años de desarrollo, ya está disponible]]></title><description><![CDATA[Después de un largo proceso de desarrollo que comenzó en 2018, Sonic GX, el esperado remake de Sonic the Hedgehog para la consola Amstrad GX-4000/Plus, ya está disponible para su descarga gratuita.

En el pasado, esta dolencia se asociaba principalmente con trabajadores de mayor edad.

El texto recuerda que su llegada al poder fue consecuencia de la dictadura franquista y que la Transición no permitió un referéndum para decidir entre monarquía o república, lo que ha generado descontento histórico. Se critica la figura del 'rey emérito' como una invención sin parangón en otras monarquías democráticas, que le otorga impunidad vitalicia. El artículo también se burla de su nuevo libro de memorias, titulado 'Reconciliación', en el que el exmonarca se lamenta de su aislamiento y pide perdón, pero sin asumir responsabilidades ni devolver el dinero acumulado.

Según Joaquín, los trabajos no tienen licencia para afectar a su propiedad y acusa a los responsables de querer forzarlo a abandonar su casa, una denuncia que incluye malas prácticas y corrupción en el proceso. El Ayuntamiento de Vigo asegura que la demolición tiene licencia y está autorizada judicialmente, pero Joaquín no ve avances en la resolución del conflicto y acusa a las autoridades de no intervenir de forma efectiva.

Esta postura del PP español llega en un contexto de negociaciones con Vox para la formación de un nuevo gobierno en la Comunidad Valenciana. Fuentes del PPE justifican el voto afirmando que la propuesta es demasiado ambiciosa y difícil de cumplir, especialmente considerando la antigüedad del parque automovilístico y el uso de combustibles fósiles en el país.

Una historia de amor' de Juan del Val, ganadora del Premio Planeta 2025, ha sido duramente criticada por su lenguaje pobre y falta de imaginación. En la crítica, se menciona que la 'voz directa' del autor, tan destacada en la solapa del libro, en realidad enmascara una escritura inexperta y una narrativa floja. La novela cuenta la historia de Vera, una mujer de 45 años que atraviesa una separación, y su relación con Antonio, un joven de 35 años con un pasado complicado. A lo largo de la trama, los personajes se entrelazan con los destinos de los hermanos de ambos, Alba y Diego, quienes también tienen papeles relevantes pero algo forzados. La crítica menciona la presencia de escenas eróticas y compara el enfoque del autor con una narrativa de baja categoría, como las fantasías del 'fontanero'. El final, donde el personaje de Borja se suicida tras ser revelada su maldad, se considera otro ejemplo de lo que se percibe como una falta de profundidad en la construcción de los personaj]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-negativa-de-vera-una-historia-de-amor-la-novela-ganadora-del-premio-planeta-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-negativa-de-vera-una-historia-de-amor-la-novela-ganadora-del-premio-planeta-2025</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 01:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenido en Valencia por violar a su sobrina de seis años; antecedentes de 2019 por abusos a otra menor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre de 36 años ha sido detenido en Valencia acusado de violar a su sobrina, una niña de seis años con autismo.

Las pruebas médicas indicaron lesiones genitourinarias compatibles con el relato, aunque el himen permanecía intacto. La investigación, a cargo del Grupo de Menores de la Policía Nacional, llevó a que el detenido fuera puesto en libertad con una prohibición de aproximarse a menos de cien metros de la víctima. Paralelamente, se ha revelado que este mismo individuo fue arrestado en 2019 por abusos a otra menor de su entorno familiar, antecedente que quedó cancelado al ser absuelto por la defensa.

Según datos de la OCU, el coste de la docena de huevos más barata, que era de poco más de dos euros hace unos meses, ahora supera los tres. Además, desde 2021, los precios han subido más de un 100% tanto en huevos medianos como grandes. Esta subida afecta especialmente a las familias con menos recursos, ya que el incremento se da sobre todo en los huevos más baratos. El fenómeno, conocido como “efecto cohete y pluma”, hace que los precios suban rápidamente pero apenas bajen cuando el coste en origen disminuye. Las causas de esta subida son varias: aumento de los precios en origen, brotes de gripe aviar que han reducido la producción, resistencia de los intermediarios a bajar márgenes y cambios en la oferta de los supermercados, optando por huevos de suelo y camperos, más caros.

En su mensaje, el usuario señalaba que, a pesar de la disminución de la inflación, los precios seguían altos, y afirmaba que el 'socialismo' no era un 'camino de rosas'. Sin embargo, la respuesta de la comunidad en las redes sociales no se hizo esperar. Muchos usuarios le criticaron por no tener en cuenta factores como la gripe aviar, que afecta a la producción de huevos, o el hecho de que los precios son fijados por empresas privadas.

Según su declaración, Mazón pasó gran parte del tiempo con su móvil en mano, especialmente utilizando WhatsApp para intercambiar mensajes. Aunque no escuchó sus llamadas telefónicas, Vilaplana confirmó que Mazón estaba constantemente 'whatsappeando' en el restaurante El Ventorro, mientras se encontraba con ella. La testigo destacó que Mazón estaba mucho más en silencio que conversando, y que las comunicaciones por WhatsApp parecían ser su principal medio de contacto, aunque no pudo precisar si usaba otras aplicaciones. La información sobre sus mensajes de WhatsApp no se ha hecho pública y contrasta con la documentación de llamadas proporcionada por otras fuentes, como la exconsellera Salomé Pradas.

Esta mejora se produce tras la noticia de que el Gobierno tiene planes para recomprar bonos soberanos a lo largo de toda la curva de vencimientos, una estrategia que ha incrementado la confianza en los mercados. Durante la jornada, el riesgo país llegó a tocar los 596 puntos básicos, una baja significativa desde el cierre de la semana pasada. El optimismo también se ha reflejado en los bonos soberanos, que han registrado aumentos de hasta un 2%, con los Bonares y Globales subiendo de forma destacada. En paralelo, las acciones argentinas también han experimentado una notable subida, destacándose las de Ternium y Aluar, mientras que la estabilidad del dólar oficial y el dólar blue continúa en el mercado cambiario.

En una rueda de prensa posterior a un Comité de Dirección del PP, Feijóo se dirigió al presidente de la ciudad autónoma, Juan José Imbroda, con una frase machista que rápidamente se viralizó en las redes sociales. 'No sé qué te da tu mujer, pero cada día estás mejor', dijo el líder del PP, un comentario que desató un torrente de críticas. Esta frase, considerada sexista, eclipsó el propósito principal de la visita, que era presentar compromisos políticos y económicos para Melilla. Además de la polémica por la frase, Feijóo también hizo declaraciones de corte xenófobo, prometiendo 'europeizar' la ciudad autónoma en caso de llegar al Gobierno, y refiriéndose a medidas para reforzar la seguridad y la soberanía de Melilla, así como mejorar áreas como la sanidad y la educación.

La denuncia proviene de una carta enviada por la víctima al Dicasterio de Doctrina de la Fe, en la que detalla que Zornoza se introducía en su cama, lo acariciaba y besaba, además de someterle a terapias de conversión para 'curar' su homosexualidad. La víctima asegura que los abusos ocurrieron entre los 14 y 21 años y que, en varias ocasiones, Zornoza reconoció los hechos. El Obispado de Cádiz y Ceuta ha negado las acusaciones y ha suspendido temporalmente la agenda del obispo, quien se encuentra en tratamiento contra un cáncer agresivo.

Se señalan rangos de precio que van desde 400 a 1.500 euros mensuales, con ejemplos en Maspalomas, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria y otros municipios. La falta de oferta acorde al sueldo medio canario, que ronda los 22.531 euros brutos anuales, ha provocado que muchos canarios deban afrontar opciones de vivienda más caras o verse fuera del mercado. Organizaciones como Derecho al Techo advierten de la explotación encubierta y la vulneración del derecho a una vivienda digna, denunciando prácticas especulativas y excluyentes, especialmente contra parejas.

El tribunal considera probado que el acusado ejerció violencia física y psicológica sobre los menores a través de agresiones, insultos y conductas vejatorias. Además, el hogar donde los niños residían con su padre carecía de las condiciones mínimas de higiene y seguridad, lo que provocó que los menores estuvieran infestados de pulgas. El padre tampoco proporcionaba la medicación necesaria a su hijo ni una alimentación adecuada. Los informes psicológicos y testimonios de los menores acreditan el sufrimiento emocional sufrido.

Se afirma que los intereses corporativos y estatales habrían promovido un mapa euroasiático que favorece la desestabilización de Rusia, y que la élite occidental habría utilizado instrumentos como sanciones, apoyo a conflictos regionales y campañas mediáticas para justificar una presencia militar prolongada.

El empresario Timur Mindich, amigo cercano de Zelenski y socio en la productora Kvartal 95, ha sido señalado como un intermediario clave en esta red de corrupción.

La violencia se concentró especialmente en la zona de Masafer Yatta, donde cuatro personas resultaron heridas. En la aldea de Umm al Jeir, un anciano y un joven fueron atacados con palos. En otro incidente, colonos robaron ovejas y golpearon a un joven en la aldea de Safi al Fawqa. La agresión, que se repite frecuentemente en la región, también fue documentada a través de redes sociales. Los ataques, a menudo perpetrados por colonos que viven en asentamientos ilegales, cuentan con el apoyo tácito del Ejército israelí, que ha sido criticado por permitir la impunidad de los agresores.

Además, se propone añadir un 5% adicional por cada inmueble a partir del quinto, con el fin de evitar que grandes tenedores acaparen propiedades. En la misma sesión, se debatirá otra ley relacionada con el alquiler de viviendas, impulsada por Sumar y socios de izquierda, que también ha sido apoyada por ERC. La formación independentista también plantea eliminar beneficios fiscales para las Socimi (Sociedades Anónimas Cotizadas de Inversión en el Mercado Inmobiliario), que actualmente disfrutan de un régimen fiscal muy favorable.

Un paso importante fue dado por Camboya, que se convirtió en el primer país en trasladar parte de sus reservas de oro desde bancos occidentales hacia China, reflejando una creciente desconfianza en Occidente. Este movimiento se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de desdolarización global, impulsada por China, que promueve su Bolsa de Oro en Shanghái como nuevo centro de custodia para las reservas de oro extranjeras. Otros países, como Arabia Saudita, Malasia e Indonesia, también están alineándose con este nuevo sistema financiero.

A medida que la vivienda se ha convertido en una inversión financiera, el coste de vivir se ha disparado, lo que ha dificultado la formación de familias. Este fenómeno afecta a jóvenes de todo el mundo, que destinan una parte significativa de sus ingresos al alquiler o la compra de viviendas, dejando menos recursos para la crianza de hijos. Investigaciones realizadas en países como China, Brasil, Japón y Australia demuestran que la inseguridad y la falta de accesibilidad a la vivienda contribuyen a la baja tasa de natalidad. La solución pasaría por tratar la vivienda como un bien social y no como un activo financiero, para asegurar que las personas puedan formar y mantener familias sin las presiones económicas actuales.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-mercantilizacion-de-la-vivienda-en-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-fertilidad-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-mercantilizacion-de-la-vivienda-en-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-fertilidad-global</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 17:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump otorga indultos a Giuliani y otros implicados en los intentos de anular las elecciones de 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[Donald Trump ha concedido un perdón simbólico y preventivo a 77 personas vinculadas a sus esfuerzos por revertir los resultados de las elecciones presidenciales de 2020.

El perdón, anunciado por Ed Martin, abogado de la Casa Blanca, no tiene impacto legal, ya que los implicados no enfrentan cargos federales. La medida se enmarca dentro de la estrategia de Trump para reescribir el relato del asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, y se interpreta como un ajuste de cuentas político, dado que ha utilizado el indulto para premiar a colaboradores cercanos y continuar con su narrativa de que las elecciones fueron fraudulentas, a pesar de la evidencia contraria.

A raíz de los hechos, el niño fue retirado de su entorno familiar y se dictó su desamparo provisional.

Estas ofertas secretas, accesibles a través de 'amagos' de portabilidad o mediante procesos de retención, ofrecen descuentos significativos en comparación con los precios oficiales. Vodafone y Lowi han liderado esta estrategia con tarifas que pueden ser hasta un 30% más baratas que las de Digi, además de ofrecer condiciones más favorables a largo plazo, como la permanencia indefinida.

Zettelmeyer señala que, si Estados Unidos sigue ejerciendo un liderazgo coercitivo, Europa podría distanciarse de Washington y alinearse con otros países no alineados, como India y muchas naciones en desarrollo.

Aunque no se registraron diagnósticos erróneos, las cartas enviadas a los pacientes contenían información equivocada, incluyendo falsos negativos. Estos errores fueron detectados en febrero y los pacientes afectados fueron contactados por diversos medios, como teléfono, SMS y Atención Primaria. Según la Consejería de Sanidad, todos los procesos clínicos se mantuvieron intactos y las pruebas complementarias necesarias se realizaron correctamente. La administración subraya que el programa de cribado ha sido fiable durante más de ocho años y recalca que los ciudadanos pueden confiar en el mismo.

LaInspección investigaba si TMB había pagado las diferencias de cotización de los últimos cuatro años para miles de trabajadores, además de las diferencias de cotización asociadas a un complemento de puesto de trabajo. A pesar de requerimientos reiterados, la empresa no aportó la documentación necesaria, alegando que no se habían abonado atrasos ni pagos adicionales. La Inspección continuó solicitando documentos para poder calcular la deuda potencial, y TMB respondió de forma ambigua. El tribunal supremo confirmó la sanción, quedando firme. En el proceso, las diferencias de cotización totalizaron más de 810.000 euros, y la posibilidad de sanciones adicionales de hasta más de 225.000 euros también estuvo en juego.

HKG, que es copropiedad de RWE y varias empresas municipales, había solicitado al gobierno alemán 350 millones de euros para cubrir estos gastos, pero un tribunal rechazó su demanda en junio de 2025. La planta, en funcionamiento solo tres años antes de ser retirada en 1989, fue un prototipo experimental que no alcanzó sus objetivos. Ahora, los costos estimados para el desmantelamiento se calculan entre 750 millones y 1.000 millones de euros, lo que podría generar una carga financiera para el Estado alemán.

El objetivo declarado es desincentivar la concentración de vivienda en manos de grandes tenedores y fomentar el alquiler social y la vivienda habitual. El impuesto beginning con un 4% para la tercera vivienda, escalando al 8% desde la cuarta y al 12% desde la quinta, con aumentos subsecuentes de 5 puntos porcentuales por cada vivienda adicional.

El perdón se aplica solo a los cargos federales, no a los estatales, y no cubre al propio Trump.

La investigación histórica reciente ha permitido comprender mejor este período y desmontar los mitos sobre su supuesto bienestar económico.

Sin embargo, en la calle, el descontento con la gestión de la sanidad pública es evidente, especialmente en relación con la crisis de los cribados de cáncer de mama. Aunque Bonilla aseguró que el problema estaba resuelto 'al 80%', miles de personas se manifestaron en defensa de la sanidad pública, denunciando la negligencia y la falta de transparencia en el sistema. La crisis de los cribados surgió cuando se descubrió que muchas personas, algunas incluso con diagnóstico tardío de cáncer, no fueron citadas a tiempo. Los críticos acusan a la Junta de Andalucía de privatizar progresivamente la sanidad pública, lo que ha generado un ambiente de desconfianza y malestar entre los pacientes y el personal sanitario. Esta crisis refleja un problema más amplio dentro del sistema de salud, en el que la falta de recursos y la gestión inadecuada están perjudican]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-partido-popular-y-la-crisis-de-los-cribados-de-cancer-de-mama-en-andalucia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-partido-popular-y-la-crisis-de-los-cribados-de-cancer-de-mama-en-andalucia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El gobierno del Reino Unido actualiza a Windows 10 a pesar de su inminente fin de soporte]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Departamento de Medio Ambiente, Alimentación y Asuntos Rurales (Defra) del Reino Unido ha completado una actualización tecnológica significativa, invirtiendo 312 millones de libras en la renovación de decenas de miles de dispositivos antiguos a Windows 10. Esta actualización se produce después de que Microsoft dejara de ofrecer soporte oficial para este sistema operativo en octubre de 2025, lo que plantea dudas sobre la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de la medida. A pesar de la obsolescencia del sistema, la actualización busca retirar plataformas anticuadas, como Windows 7, y modernizar equipos esenciales para servicios nacionales, incluyendo operaciones fronterizas y sistemas de inundaciones. Sin embargo, Defra aún enfrenta un significativo rezago tecnológico, con 24,000 dispositivos obsoletos y otros 26,000 dispositivos y componentes esperando ser reemplazados.

El suceso ocurrió el domingo por la noche, cuando los servicios de emergencia fueron llamados a la casa de la familia. A pesar de los esfuerzos de paramédicos, el bebé fue declarado muerto en el lugar. El perro, que tenía seis años, fue registrado antes de que entrara en vigor una nueva ley que prohíbe la posesión de perros de esta raza en 2024. Tras el ataque, el perro fue sedado y trasladado al veterinario, donde se sacrificó. La policía ha abierto una investigación para esclarecer los hechos y, hasta el momento, no se han realizado arrestos. Las autoridades piden cautela en los comentarios públicos para respetar el proceso investigativo y la privacidad de la familia.

A pesar del tiempo transcurrido, no se sabe nada sobre el estado del informe ni cuándo estará disponible. La falta de avances es llamativa, especialmente si se compara con otros casos como la investigación de Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente Pedro Sánchez, en la que la UCO entregó rápidamente un informe tras unos pocos días de solicitud.

Las niñas relataron que el acusado aprovechaba su relación con la abuela para quedarse a solas con ellas y agredirlas, incluso en la piscina de la casa y en parques. La mayor de las víctimas contó que fue violada más de treinta veces y que el hombre también obligaba a las menores a beber batidos y tomar pastillas que les hacían perder la memoria, según la Fiscalía, que sospecha que contenían cocaína. Tras ser descubierto, el acusado envió un mensaje de audio reconociendo sus actos, aunque en el juicio negó los hechos. Las exploraciones psicológicas y los testimonios de las niñas han sido considerados creíbles por los agentes y la psicóloga forense.

El acuerdo permitirá la reapertura del gobierno sin garantías de que se prorroguen las ayudas sanitarias bajo la Ley de Cuidado de la Salud Asequible (Obamacare). A pesar de la oposición de varios líderes demócratas, que exigen una extensión de estas ayudas, Trump sigue sin ofrecer una alternativa clara al sistema de Obamacare. El acuerdo, respaldado por algunos demócratas moderados, también incluye medidas para la protección de empleados federales y la financiación de programas clave, como la ayuda alimentaria y los veteranos. Sin embargo, la batalla sobre los subsidios sanitarios continuará y el resultado final sigue siendo incierto, lo que genera tensiones dentro del partido demócrata.

La protagonista, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, máxima autoridad jurídica militar de Israel, fue suspendida y después dimitió tras admitir ser autora de la filtración. La noticia resalta dos reacciones principales en la opinión israelí: la derecha considera que el caso es una maniobra de conspiración del 'Estado profundo' para atacar los valores nacionales, mientras que el sector liberal justifica la filtración como un acto por la justicia y el Estado de derecho, obviando la cuestión del genocidio en Gaza.

Utilizando 500 vapeadores desechables que rescató de la basura, construyó una batería casera capaz de alimentar su hogar y taller. Los vapeadores, comúnmente desechados al agotarse, contienen baterías internas que aún conservan capacidad, lo que llevó a Doel a probar su reutilización. Recogió los dispositivos en tiendas locales, desarmándolos y seleccionando las baterías con mejor rendimiento. Tras organizarlas en módulos y usar tecnología reciclada de otros dispositivos, logró crear una batería de 2,52 kWh y 40 kilos de peso. La batería fue configurada para proporcionar 230 voltios de corriente alterna, alimentando su taller y parte de su vivienda. Doel planea instalar paneles solares para hacer su sistema completamente autosuficiente.

Este ataque no fue solo un desvío de la seguridad pública, sino una acción con un marcado componente político, diseñada para interrumpir la recuperación de prestigio internacional del país bajo el liderazgo de Lula. La reacción internacional ante la masacre también afecta la imagen de Brasil, justo antes de la COP 30, un evento clave para la diplomacia brasileña.

Este análisis, realizado a partir del trabajo del filólogo judío alemán Victor Klemperer, explora cómo el lenguaje ha sido utilizado históricamente para manipular y polarizar a la sociedad. Gaupp y Labrador, en su artículo de 2020, muestran cómo este lenguaje busca construir un relato en el que los 'otros' son demonizados y la nación se presenta como amenazada. Durante el debate, al que asistieron más de 200 personas, se discutieron los orígenes y los factores que favorecen la aceptación de estos discursos, así como las tácticas de resistencia que pueden contrarrestar el impacto de esta retórica.

El dinero, que debía utilizarse para el bienestar de los sacerdotes, fue presuntamente desviado por el fraile y un cómplice hacia cuentas bancarias en Colombia y Argentina. La investigación comenzó a raíz de varias denuncias de familiares de los sacerdotes afectados, quienes alertaron sobre la presunta estafa, en la que las víctimas, debido a su edad y estado de salud, no eran conscientes de la desviación de fondos. Las autoridades descubrieron que uno de los implicados tenía acceso a las cuentas bancarias de los residentes y habría transferido diversas cantidades de dinero a través de locutorios a países extranjeros.

Esta victoria plantea retos tanto para Donald Trump como para los demócratas.

Además, el auge del socialismo urbano y la insatisfacción de la generación Z con el capitalismo podrían alterar el panorama político.

Las causas más frecuentes de las bajas laborales son problemas musculoesqueléticos y de salud mental, exacerbados por el envejecimiento de la población laboral y el estrés crónico. Las mutuas y empresas recurren a detectives privados para investigar estos fraudes, pero sindicatos como UGT advierten de que esta tendencia puede criminalizar a los trabajadores enfermos y restar atención a la prevención. La verdadera solución al absentismo no solo debe centrarse en las investigaciones, sino también en mejorar las condiciones laborales y reforzar la a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-mayoria-de-las-bajas-medicas-investigadas-en-espana-son-fraudulentas-pero-solo-se-investigan-con-indicios-claros-de-fraude</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-mayoria-de-las-bajas-medicas-investigadas-en-espana-son-fraudulentas-pero-solo-se-investigan-con-indicios-claros-de-fraude</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 03:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Isabel Díaz Ayuso recupera la agenda tras ser dada de alta por gastroenteritis y bajada de tensión]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha sido dada de alta en el Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz tras sufrir una bajada de tensión provocada por una fuerte gastroenteritis. Ayuso acudió este domingo a la misa en honor a la Virgen de la Almudena, patrona de Madrid, donde realizó declaraciones a los medios sobre sus deseos para la ciudad. Minutos después, al sentirse indispuesta, fue trasladada en ambulancia al hospital por decisión del Samur, que detectó una disminución de tensión y pulsaciones. Las fuentes regionales confirmaron que la jefa del Ejecutivo autonómico se encuentra estable y prevé retomar su agenda pública el próximo martes, ya que el lunes 10 de noviembre es festivo en la capital. Este sábado, Ayuso ya había tenido que suspender parte de su agenda por una leve indisposición y canceló su participación en el congreso del PP de Andalucía.

Situado en el macizo de Los Urrieles, este glaciar fue una de las últimas reliquias de la Pequeña Edad del Hielo, que perduró hasta principios del siglo XXI. A pesar de que el equipo de geógrafos de la Universidad de León monitoreó su retroceso desde 2004, en octubre de 2025 se constató que casi todo el hielo había desaparecido, dejando solo un pequeño vestigio de lo que fue una gran masa de hielo. El Trasllambrión alimentó a la cordillera durante siglos, pero el cambio climático ha acelerado su desaparición. En su momento, este glaciar llegó a cubrir una superficie de 10 hectáreas, pero ya en los años 90 comenzó a reducirse. Con su extinción, el Parque de Picos de Europa pierde una parte fundamental de su patrimonio natural. El geógrafo Javier Santos lamenta esta pérdida, recordando que los glaciares, además de ser fuentes de agua, modelan paisajes únicos y son clave par]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/desaparece-el-trasllambrion-el-ultimo-glaciar-de-leon-tras-su-extincion-por-el-cambio-climatico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/desaparece-el-trasllambrion-el-ultimo-glaciar-de-leon-tras-su-extincion-por-el-cambio-climatico</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 01:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La escasa reacción ante las mentiras de Miguel Ángel Rodríguez en el entorno político y mediático]]></title><description><![CDATA[Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, jefe de gabinete de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso, se ha visto envuelto en múltiples polémicas por difundir mentiras, pero sorprendentemente, pocas voces exigen su dimisión. A pesar de las peticiones de partidos como Más Madrid y del propio PSOE, así como de varias asociaciones de periodistas que condenaron sus amenazas y desinformaciones, el caso no ha tenido el impacto esperado. Rodríguez ha mentido públicamente sobre varios temas, como el supuesto intento de pacto entre la Fiscalía de Madrid y Alberto González, conocido como 'El Novio', y sobre el contenido de un correo de este último. Sin embargo, sus declaraciones han sido respaldadas y defendidas por sus compañeros del PP, quienes parecen ver en él una figura estratégica más que un mentiroso. En este contexto, se plantea una reflexión sobre cómo la mentira en la política ha dejado de escandalizar a la sociedad, lo que refleja un preocupante cambio en los valores y la ética política.

Este cambio se debe en gran parte a la creciente participación de las mujeres en el mercado laboral, quienes han impulsado una transformación en los modelos de trabajo. A lo largo de las últimas décadas, las mujeres comenzaron a ocupar empleos a tiempo parcial, lo que permitió reconfigurar las estructuras familiares y laborales. Hoy en día, el modelo laboral en los Países Bajos favorece la conciliación de la vida personal y profesional, contribuyendo a una tasa de desempleo baja. Este sistema flexible no solo beneficia a los padres que se encargan del cuidado de sus hijos, sino que también ha permitido a muchas personas seguir activas en la fuerza laboral.

Durante la marcha, se produjeron disturbios que incluyeron el quemado de contenedores y la destrucción de mobiliario público, además de enfrentamientos con los agentes. Tras la intervención de la Policía, que utilizó porras y disparos disuasorios, los manifestantes se dispersaron por el barrio de Las Letras, dejando a su paso daños materiales. Los organizadores de la marcha intentaron evitar que los participantes mantuvieran símbolos ultras y anunciaron el fin de la protesta.

Esta controversia surgió después de que, durante un debate en Antena Huelva, Romero responsabilizara a los equipos médicos por no contactar a las 2.317 mujeres afectadas por los fallos en el cribado. Las reacciones no se hicieron esperar, con fuertes críticas desde los sindicatos de médicos y el Consejo Andaluz de Colegios de Médicos, que exigieron una rectificación pública.

Este desequilibrio se acentúa al mirar las homologaciones: apenas 29 de las 233 balizas listadas son fabricadas exclusivamente en España, representando el 12% del total. El fabricante más prolífico es Ningbo Chakesi Electronic Co., Ltd. (China), cuyo principal cliente Limburg Technology Limited registró 78 homologaciones, y sus modelos aparecen bajo numerosas marcas.

La investigación, llevada a cabo por la Unidad Central de Falsificación de Moneda de la DIC, reveló que los billetes falsificados procedían directamente de la Camorra italiana y presentaban un alto grado de calidad, lo que dificultaba su detección. El operativo, realizado el 5 de noviembre, reunió a efectivos del Área Central de Crimen Organizado de la DIC y del ARRO de la Región Policial Metropolitana Norte, y resultó en la detención de siete sospechosos (cuatro mujeres y tres hombres) que habían privilegiado esta modalidad de fraude operando desde viviendas múltiples en el mismo barrio.

La Exposición Internacional de Artes Decorativas de 1925 en París dio nombre a este movimiento, que rápidamente se extendió por el mundo, desde los rascacielos de Nueva York hasta los edificios más emblemáticos de Miami Beach. Sus principales características incluyen formas geométricas, simetría elegante y materiales lujosos como el mármol, ónix y acero inoxidable, a la par que elementos inspirados en civilizaciones antiguas.

Mientras algunos defensores del expresidente la consideran una solución para facilitar la compra de vivienda, muchos analistas y políticos han calificado la idea como 'espectacularmente tonta'. La propuesta, que busca alargar el plazo de las hipotecas actuales a 50 años, podría resultar en un aumento significativo de los intereses a pagar a lo largo de la vida de los prestatarios. Por ejemplo, una casa de 400.000 dólares bajo una hipoteca a 30 años se pagaría a un total de 863.000 dólares, mientras que bajo la propuesta de Trump ese monto se elevaría a 1,38 millones de dólares. Expertos como Mike Nellis y el inversor Alex Cole consideran que esta medida podría enriquecer a los bancos y dejar a los ciudadanos atrapados en deudas durante toda su vida.

El hallazgo más relevante es que el Hemisferio Norte se oscurece más rápido que el Sur, absorbiendo aproximadamente 0.34 vatios más por metro cuadrado y por década. Este desbalance se debe a tres factores principales: el deshielo que expone superficies más oscuras, la reducción de aerosoles en la atmósfera por regulaciones ambientales que disminuye la reflexión de la luz, y el aumento de vapor de agua en el Norte debido al mayor calentamiento. Aunque la cobertura de nubes no ha mostrado cambios significativos en las últimas dos décadas, los investigadores señalan que podría haber incertidumbres sobre su comportamiento futuro.

La conversación fluye entre los asistentes de la taberna, que se muestran cada vez más desconcertados ante las profundas y abstractas reflexiones sobre el infinito y los subconjuntos de los números reales. A través de esta narrativa, Carlo Frabetti invita a reflexionar sobre la complejidad matemática y teológica de las relaciones interpersonales y los límites del entendimiento humano. La historia también plantea cuestiones sobre la transfinidad y la posibilidad de relaciones divinas más allá de los binomios tradicionales, ampliando la visión del amor y la creación infinita.

A través de crónicas impactantes, Kostyuchenko relata las historias de personas que han quedado fuera del modelo de nación promovido por Putin, como víctimas de la violencia institucional, la represión y la discriminación. La periodista recuerda cómo su perspectiva cambió a medida que cubría las atrocidades cometidas por el régimen, desde la persecución a las minorías hasta la tortura en los internados psiconeurológicos.

Foley urgió a Trump a tomar medidas inmediatas para aliviar la situación, advirtiendo que sin cambios los republicanos podrían perder el control del Congreso en 2026. En su respuesta, Trump insistió en que los precios están 'muy bajos' y atribuyó esta mejora a la reducción de los costes energéticos, destacando que 'cuando la energía baja, todo baja'. Además, criticó a los republicanos por no hablar adecuadamente sobre la 'asequibilidad' y acusó a los demócratas de mentir sobre este tema. Sin embargo, datos oficiales muestran que mientras el precio de la gasolina ha disminuido un 8%, los precios de la electricidad y de los alimentos básicos como la carne de vacuno han subido significativamente, afectando la economía de las familias.

Durante la cosecha de este año, más de 4.000 olivos han sido vandalizados, y más de 250 ataques han sido reportados, afectando tanto a agricultores como a activistas que intentan ayudarles. El conflicto se ha intensificado con el apoyo tácito de las autoridades israelíes, lo que ha incrementado la sensación de impunidad entre los colonos. A pesar de los esfuerzos de los palestinos por regresar a sus tierras, la violencia y las restricciones impuestas por el ejército israelí continúan dificultando su acceso. La cosecha de aceitunas no solo es una tradición cultural, sino una actividad económica vital para unas 100.000 familias palestinas. La ONU y diversas organizaciones han señalado la necesidad de garantizar la seguridad de los palestinos y detener estos ataques, pero la situación sigue siendo ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-violencia-de-los-colonos-israelies-afecta-gravemente-la-cosecha-de-aceitunas-palestinas-en-la-ribera-occidental</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-violencia-de-los-colonos-israelies-afecta-gravemente-la-cosecha-de-aceitunas-palestinas-en-la-ribera-occidental</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 21:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Robos en hospitales: realidad diaria y falta de soluciones eficaces]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda el problema real y poco visibilizado de los robos en hospitales, una situación que afecta tanto a pacientes, especialmente ancianos y personas vulnerables, como a los propios trabajadores sanitarios.

El texto destaca el caso de un anciano estafado sistemáticamente en una cafetería, como punto de partida para reflexionar sobre cómo el abuso de la confianza y la indefensión de los enfermos hace que los hospitales sean lugares propicios para este tipo de hurtos.

La investigación también ha identificado a otra hija de 7 años, invidente, con lesiones oculares similares, lo que hace sospechar que podrían haber sido intencionadas. La mujer, que llegó a Alicante con la hija mayor, alegó en su momento problemas psicológicos y había intentado entregar a sus hijos en una comisaría por no poder hacerse cargo de ellos.

La sentencia, emitida en septiembre de 2025, anula una sanción de 200 euros que la Dirección General de Tráfico había impuesto a un conductor cuyo coche permanecía estacionado en la calle, sin que estuviese en circulación. Según el fallo, la ley sanciona únicamente la circulación de vehículos sin la ITV vigente, no el mero hecho de estar aparcado. El juez destaca que la infracción requiere que el vehículo esté en movimiento, ya que el núcleo de la norma está en el verbo 'circular'. Hasta ahora, tanto la DGT como algunos tribunales interpretaban que era sancionable cualquier vehículo con la ITV caducada, incluso sin estar circulando. Sin embargo, el magistrado reconoce una 'reconsideración' respecto a resoluciones anteriores y subraya que multar a un coche parado por ese motivo no previene ningún riesgo para la seguridad vial.

Según el líder burkinés, estos grupos extremistas son financiados y entrenados por países imperialistas para desestabilizar la región africana y robar sus recursos naturales. Traoré aseveró que el objetivo de estas potencias es mantener a África en un estado de guerra permanente, lo que impide su desarrollo y perpetúa la explotación de sus riquezas.

A pesar de las estrictas medidas de seguridad, muchos berlineses idearon formas de cruzar la frontera, siendo los túneles una de las soluciones más arriesgadas y a la vez exitosas. El primer túnel se excavó solo un mes después de la construcción del muro, en una historia que tiene tintes románticos, ya que un par de jóvenes excavan un túnel para sacar a sus novias. Con el paso de los años, la construcción de túneles se convirtió en una de las formas más utilizadas para escapar del régimen comunista, siendo responsables de la fuga de cientos de personas. Sin embargo, no todos los túneles tuvieron éxito. Muchos fueron descubiertos antes de que las personas pudieran escapar, y otros se derrumbaron antes de ser terminados.

La noticia sugiere que la firma de inversiones busca reorientar su portfolio hacia oportunidades potencialmente menos volátiles o con mayores perspectivas de liquidez. A nivel de mercado, este movimiento podría influir en los precios de activos similares y en la percepción de inversores sobre el riesgo asociado a plataformas de vivienda asistida y comunidades para adultos mayores.

A través de una narrativa fragmentada y no lineal, la autora construye un relato que transita entre los años 1970 y 2010, donde lo que se transmite no son relatos, sino silencios que atraviesan a los personajes. La novela se centra en la relación entre Stella y Emma, madre e hija, quienes cargan con secretos y emociones reprimidas que marcan su destino. Los silencios entre ellas y las promesas incumplidas —como el viaje al Pacífico que nunca se realiza— sirven como metáforas de lo no dicho y lo no vivido. El mar, que da título a la obra, se convierte en un símbolo de lo inalcanzable, de las promesas rotas y de la violencia latente. Aareleid también aborda temas como la violencia en el cuerpo femenino y la identidad en conflicto, todo ello envuelto en una atmósfera de lirismo y crudez]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kai-aareleid-explora-la-memoria-heredada-y-los-silencios-en-oceano-pacifico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kai-aareleid-explora-la-memoria-heredada-y-los-silencios-en-oceano-pacifico</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 16:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump muestra dificultades para mantener los ojos abiertos en un evento oficial de la Casa Blanca]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 6 de noviembre de 2025, durante un evento en la Oficina Oval centrado en los recortes de precios de los medicamentos, el presidente Donald Trump mostró evidentes dificultades para mantener los ojos abiertos durante un lapso de aproximadamente 20 minutos. Este incidente ha generado preocupación y especulaciones sobre su estado de salud, especialmente dado que la situación se produjo en un acto importante de la Casa Blanca, donde se discutían temas cruciales de política sanitaria. Aunque el presidente parecía luchar por mantenerse alerta, no se dieron detalles sobre su bienestar durante el evento ni más comentarios por parte de la Casa Blanca sobre el suceso. Este tipo de incidentes, especialmente cuando involucran a figuras públicas de alto perfil, a menudo despiertan debates sobre su capacidad para seguir cumpliendo con sus responsabilidades. Sin embargo, no hay indicios claros de que el incidente esté relacionado con un problema grave de salud, aunque la imagen de un presidente vis]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-muestra-dificultades-para-mantener-los-ojos-abiertos-en-un-evento-oficial-de-la-casa-blanca</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-muestra-dificultades-para-mantener-los-ojos-abiertos-en-un-evento-oficial-de-la-casa-blanca</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 16:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Gomera: multa de 2.250 euros por no destinar un apartamento al turismo pese a ser segunda residencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe la propuesta de sanción de 2.250 euros dirigida a propietarios de un apartamento en La Gomera que estaban utilizando la vivienda como segunda residencia y no la destinaban al turismo, a pesar de encontrarse en una zona turística. El caso surge tras la publicación de un decreto que suspendía temporalmente las multas en ciertos procedimientos, dejando en el aire si la sanción procede o no. Los propietarios sostienen que su uso es residencial y familiar, no exclusivo turístico, y argumentan que la normativa no establece que su vivienda deba funcionar como plaza alojativa de explotación turística. La Dirección General de Turismo de Canarias indica que las suspensiones eran por tres años y que algunos expedientes siguen en trámite, mientras la Plataforma de Afectados denuncia interpretaciones ambiguas del decreto.

Según su equipo, se trató de una 'leve indisposición', lo que motivó su evacuación en ambulancia, un medio elegido por ser el más rápido y seguro. La salida de Ayuso se produjo pocos minutos después de haber realizado declaraciones a los medios, en las que expresó su intención de participar en el acto religioso. Este incidente se suma a la ausencia de la presidenta en el Congreso del Partido Popular de Andalucía, celebrado el viernes pasado, también debido a motivos de salud. Aunque no se han proporcionado más detalles sobre su estado de salud, fuentes cercanas a la presidenta aseguran que no es nada grave.

Según Provost, los altos precios de los coches nuevos, sumados a la dificultad de muchos ciudadanos para adquirirlos debido a la brecha con los salarios, están llevando a que la gente mantenga vehículos cada vez más viejos. Esto no solo afecta a la descarbonización, sino también a la seguridad de los conductores, ya que muchos coches superan los 20 años de antigüedad. Además, Provost destaca que las políticas de descarbonización están aumentando los costes, haciendo aún más difícil que los europeos puedan acceder a un coche nuevo. La situación se complica en países como España, donde la media de antigüedad del parque automovilístico alcanza los 12,5 años, lo que agrava los objetivos medioambientales de la Unión Europea.

El autor plantea que Narciso no se limita a ser un joven hermosísimo que se queda ciego ante el mundo, sino que es testigo de un amor que nace al mirarse en el agua: un amor dirigido hacia su propia imagen que, paradójicamente, señala la vulnerabilidad y la necesidad de conexión con otros. Eco, por su parte, representa la fidelidad a un deseo que se desdibuja cuando la voz del otro se repite hasta la perfección repetitiva, mostrando una condena divina por negarse a amar. A lo largo del texto se exploran lecturas críticas desde la mitología clásica hasta Lacan y Dalí, pasando por Ovidio y las interpretaciones psicoanalíticas modernas, para sostener que el verdadero pecado reside en la negación del amor hacia los demás o hacia uno mismo.

La cobertura señala que, mientras desde Congreso se ha presionado al PP y a Vox para escuchar a las víctimas y recoger sus testimonios, en las Cortes y el Senado el PP trata de desviar la responsabilidad hacia el Gobierno central, citando a ministros y a Pedro Sánchez sin convocar a consellers. Se mencionan comparecencias y citaciones, incluyendo la posible participación de Carlos Mazón, presidente del PP valenciano, y la ausencia de respuestas por parte del Gobierno ante las comisiones autonómicas. Expertos consultados destacan que la incidencia de factores como las cañas en el barranco del Poyo fue nula y que existen sensores suficientes para monitorizar crecidas.

Si se realiza solo una transferencia bancaria sin seguir los procedimientos fiscales correctos, la Agencia Tributaria podría considerarlo una donación encubierta. En este caso, los padres se enfrentarían a sanciones de entre 7.000 y 9.000 euros, además de recargos e intereses. Los expertos aconsejan que para evitar estos problemas se formalice un préstamo o donación ante notario y se declare en el plazo correspondiente, utilizando el modelo 600. La diferencia entre préstamo y donación es clave, ya que mientras que el préstamo debe ser devuelto, la donación está sujeta a impuestos de sucesiones y donaciones. Si se opta por la donación y se hace de forma correcta, se pueden aplicar beneficios fiscales. En cambio, si solo se hace la transferencia sin declaración alguna, Hacienda puede imponer una sanción. La recomendación es firmar la escritura de donación]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hacienda-alerta-sobre-multas-por-ayudar-a-los-hijos-con-la-compra-de-vivienda-sin-declarar-correctamente-como-prestamo-o-donacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hacienda-alerta-sobre-multas-por-ayudar-a-los-hijos-con-la-compra-de-vivienda-sin-declarar-correctamente-como-prestamo-o-donacion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 15:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Venezuela amplía su cooperación militar con Rusia ante tensiones con EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe un incremento en la cooperación militar entre Venezuela y Rusia, con la llegada de sistemas de defensa aérea Pantsir F-1 y Buk-M2E, además de la posibilidad de suministros de misiles balísticos hipersónicos Oréshnik y misiles de crucero Kalibr.

Los flujos piroclásticos que descendieron por las laderas del volcán formaron ríos de lava y escombros que arrasaron con la ciudad de Armero, situada a sus pies. La mayoría de los 20.000 habitantes que residían allí quedaron sepultados por la avalancha de lodo y rocas. Entre las imágenes más recordadas de esa tragedia está la de Omayra Sánchez, una niña de 13 años que, atrapada bajo los escombros, pidió ayuda en sus últimos momentos, pronunciando la desgarradora frase: 'Mamá, reza para que esta gente me ayude a salir'.

Tras percibir señales de alerta, Nadia decidió marcharse, pero Harkins comenzó a acosarla con llamadas y mensajes amenazantes, incluyendo amenazas de muerte y ataques contra su familia. El acoso afectó gravemente su salud mental y autoestima, y la policía no actuó inicialmente porque las denuncias anteriores se centraban en fraudes y se trataron de forma aislada.

Según las crónicas, el emperador, conocido por su temperamento irascible, sufrió la apoplejía tras un altercado con una delegación de los cuados. El descubrimiento de un gran edificio absidal en la fortaleza, destinado a funciones de representación y recepción, parece ser el lugar donde ocurrió este evento trágico. Este hallazgo ha permitido resolver parte de un misterio histórico que llevaba siglos sin esclarecerse, y también arroja luz sobre los acontecimientos que llevaron a la proclamación de su hijo, Valentiniano II, como emperador poco después de su muerte. Los arqueólogos sugieren que la proclamación tuvo lugar en Brigetio, basándose en las pruebas geográficas y en los relatos históricos de la época.

Rodríguez, que había admitido en la instrucción que inventó parte de un mensaje difundido en redes sociales sobre la filtración de un correo relacionado con el novio de Ayuso, Alberto González Amador, defendió que este buscaba evitar un juicio para proteger la reputación de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid. Rodríguez reiteró su intuición de que el fiscal general continuaría con el caso, y a pesar de que González Amador había cometido delitos fiscales, lo consideró una víctima y no un delincuente. También argumentó que la Agencia Tributaria le impidió llegar a un acuerdo con Hacienda debido a la gravedad de los delitos.

En sus recientes memorias, el monarca arremete contra el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, acusándolo de haber transformado las investigaciones judiciales en una 'caza de brujas'. Sin embargo, la historia judicial del caso muestra una serie de irregularidades, archivadas investigaciones y regularizaciones fiscales que lo exoneraron de responsabilidades penales. En 2008, Juan Carlos I aceptó un regalo millonario del rey saudí Abdalá bin Abdulaziz y lo ocultó en bancos suizos a través de una fundación en Panamá, evitando pagar impuestos en España. La Fiscalía y el Gobierno no impulsaron acciones legales en su contra, y la inviolabilidad constitucional del monarca durante su reinado le permitió eludir consecuencias penales.

Esta investigación se produce en el marco de un esfuerzo por frenar el abuso en el mercado inmobiliario, que ha visto el auge de alquileres en condiciones insalubres aprovechando la crisis de vivienda. Tras el desmantelamiento de las infraviviendas en octubre de 2024, el Ayuntamiento de Badalona ha decidido emprender acciones contra las empresas responsables, que podrían enfrentar sanciones millonarias.

Nick Daniels, presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Controladores Aéreos, reveló que muchos están renunciando diariamente, lo que agrava la escasez de personal en los aeropuertos. A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno por reducir el tráfico aéreo en las principales ciudades para mitigar el caos, el impacto sobre la seguridad y la eficiencia del sistema de aviación está creciendo.

Se detallan proyecciones de la propuesta Rearm Europe y su posible impacto en el PIB y el gasto militar de la UE para 2035, incluyendo estimaciones de empleo por sector. Los hallazgos señalan que, si bien el gasto militar genera empleo, lo hace en menor medida que otros sectores sociales, especialmente educación y salud. En España, los estudios citados indican que invertir en educación, salud y medio ambiente produce entre dos y tres veces más puestos de trabajo que invertir en defensa.

Se destaca que Irán, con una mayoría musulmana, alberga comunidades cristianas armenias y asirias que, a pesar de la Constitución que les reconoce ciertos derechos, enfrentan limitaciones, vigilancia y periodicamente persecución. El artículo subraya la relevancia simbólica del gesto, al presentar un espacio público con un nombre cristiano, y señala que, más allá de este símbolo, los cristianos iraníes viven con miedo a la vigilancia y a las represalias del régimen. Se ofrece un recorrido histórico del cristianismo en Persia, desde sus orígenes en el siglo II ligado al apóstol Tomás, hasta su presencia contemporánea en Teherán e Isfahán, con una población estimada entre 150.000 y 200.000 personas. También se mencionan las dos comunidades principales: armenios y asirio-caldeos, con derechos parlamentarios limitados.

Según las autoridades, el detenido aprovechó la confianza que había ganado con la anciana para cometer el crimen, sin necesidad de usar violencia debido a su edad y vulnerabilidad. La familia de la víctima denunció el suceso al descubrir lo sucedido, y el hombre fue arrestado por los Mossos d'Esquadra en Figueres, donde permanece en espera de pasar a disposición judicial.

En su intervención, defendió la mejora de los recursos sanitarios y la inversión, mencionando que la partida sanitaria de 2026 sería la más alta de España.

El Ayuntamiento se desvincula formalmente del calendario, aunque el regidor reconoció haber tenido una estatua de Franco en su despacho y defendió que el negocio es independiente.

A lo largo de la entrevista, Baby aborda cómo la falta de juicios a los responsables de la dictadura ha condicionado la relación de España con su pasado. En su opinión, la Transición se hizo en continuidad con el régimen franquista, sin romper con él, lo que permitió a la derecha española mantener una relación intacta con ese pasado autoritario. La historiadora también destaca cómo el rechazo de las derechas españolas a políticas de memoria histórica, como la Ley de Memoria Democrática de 2022, es una muestra clara de la resistencia a asumir la responsabilidad por los crímenes del franquismo.

Casos como el del Prestige, el Yak-42, el accidente del Metro de Valencia, y los atentados del 11M muestran cómo los responsables políticos en el gobierno han mentido, ocultado información y desechado la verdad para proteger sus intereses. El ejemplo más destacado es el de la DANA, donde se repitieron estrategias similares a las que ya se vieron en desastres anteriores. En el caso del Prestige, la decisión de Manuel Fraga de irse de cacería mientras el crudo alcanzaba las costas gallegas es un claro ejemplo de la falta de gestión responsable.

Este innovador material combina fibras de aramida (el polímero que compone el Kevlar) con nanotubos de carbono alineados a escala molecular. Con solo 1,8 mm de grosor, este tejido es capaz de detener una bala viajando a 300 metros por segundo, superando al Kevlar y otros materiales como el Dyneema. El nuevo material ofrece ventajas significativas en términos de ligereza y movilidad, lo que podría revolucionar el diseño de chalecos antibalas, vehículos blindados y aeronaves militares. Al mejorar la resistencia dinámica y la tenacidad de las fibras, el nuevo material logra una absorción de energía más eficiente que el Kevlar, que necesita un grosor mayor para detener la misma bala.

A pesar de que se han tomado medidas judiciales para evitar la suspensión total de los pagos, la incertidumbre persiste, afectando a 42 millones de estadounidenses de bajos recursos. La situación ha puesto de relieve la creciente desigualdad en el país, donde los salarios estancados y el elevado costo de vida empujan a muchas personas a depender de este tipo de ayudas para sobrevivir. Expertos destacan que, aunque el fenómeno es parcialmente impulsado por crisis económicas como la de 2008 y la pandemia de COVID-19, también hay causas estructurales, como la desigualdad salarial y el encarecimiento de la vida. Muchos beneficiarios del SNAP tienen trabajos de bajos salarios, lo que demuestra que incluso un empleo a tiempo completo no garantiza la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-crisis-economica-en-la-ayuda-alimentaria-de-ee-uu-y-el-aumento-de-la-desigualdad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-crisis-economica-en-la-ayuda-alimentaria-de-ee-uu-y-el-aumento-de-la-desigualdad</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 22:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Una joven cubana muestra las duras condiciones de los hospitales en su país]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una cubana que reside en España ha compartido en TikTok un video mostrando las malas condiciones de un hospital en su país. En su relato, explica cómo el trayecto hasta el centro médico le genera miedo y estrés debido al deterioro de las calles y el entorno urbano, marcado por baches y basura acumulada. A su llegada, la joven evita profundizar en las condiciones sanitarias del hospital, ya que, según afirma, 'hablan por sí solas'. El hospital presenta un claro estado de abandono, con instalaciones deterioradas, aunque el centro oncológico en el que recibe tratamiento ofrece una atmósfera más limpia y humana. A pesar de las dificultades, destaca la dedicación de los profesionales médicos. El video también resalta el contraste entre la Cuba alegre que ella recuerda y la situación actual, marcada por la crisis.

La sustitución de la bandera ha tenido lugar junto a la de los Estados Unidos, lo que subraya el carácter de la protesta. Los activistas han explicado que con este gesto buscan rechazar la participación del equipo israelí en la competencia y alertar sobre la necesidad de continuar con el boicot contra Israel, al que consideran un 'Estado genocida'. La acción ha sido promovida por el colectivo 'Ciutadans per Palestina', que ha difundido el acto en redes sociales. Además, han instado a la población a seguir con el boicot y a organizar más protestas de solidaridad con Palestina.

A pesar de tener excelentes resultados en el Examen de Habilidad Académica (CSAT), estos solicitantes no fueron admitidos debido a su historial disciplinario. Esta medida refleja un cambio en la filosofía de admisión, en la que el carácter y la integridad empiezan a tener el mismo peso que las calificaciones. Las universidades coreanas, como SNU, han comenzado a restar puntos a los solicitantes con antecedentes de acoso escolar, y este enfoque ahora se está extendiendo a otras instituciones.

Según Lindo, la crianza actual no está enfocada en formar buenos seres humanos, sino en preparar a los niños para ser triunfadores en el ámbito académico y profesional. Asegura que la sobreprotección comienza desde una edad temprana y se extiende hasta la universidad, un fenómeno que también se refleja en los casos de padres que intervienen en las gestiones académicas de sus hijos adultos, incluso en universidades. Además, comparó la situación actual con la de los niños nacidos en los años 80, que según Lindo, tenían más libertad e independencia de sus padres.

Este servicio, prometido por el presidente de la Generalitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón, aún no se ha puesto en marcha, debido a la falta de personal y recursos. Se estima que faltan 300 bomberos para cubrir los turnos y la situación se ha visto agravada por la inestabilidad en la dirección del servicio, con dimisiones sucesivas.

A través de testimonios de empresarios como José Manuel Louro y Daniel Infante, se ilustra cómo la interrupción de conexiones IP, ordenada por LaLiga y basada en direcciones IP compartidas, genera daños colaterales, afectando a clientes y proveedores y dificultando operaciones como ventas online y generación de informes contables.

Se caracteriza por la acumulación de grasa en el hígado en ausencia de consumo elevado de alcohol y está relacionada con el sobrepeso, la obesidad, la diabetes tipo 2 y el síndrome metabólico. El inicio de la enfermedad suele ser silencioso, lo que dificulta su detección precoz y puede desembocar en complicaciones graves como fibrosis, cirrosis o cáncer de hígado. El diagnóstico definitivo requiere actualmente una biopsia hepática, pero estudios recientes proponen indicadores no invasivos como el índice de hígado graso (FLI) y la ecografía para identificar de manera temprana a las personas en riesgo. Un estudio realizado por Quirónprevención, basado en más de 3.000 reconocimientos médicos laborales, demuestra que el FLI es una herramienta útil y coste-efectiva para detectar la enfermedad y facilitar intervenciones preventivas antes de que evoluci]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-indice-de-higado-graso-fli-mejora-el-cribado-laboral-precoz-de-la-enfermedad-hepatica-silenciosa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-indice-de-higado-graso-fli-mejora-el-cribado-laboral-precoz-de-la-enfermedad-hepatica-silenciosa</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 19:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El discurso de Abascal sobre la libertad de prensa, puesto en duda tras comentarios y contradicciones públicas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Santiago Abascal, líder de Vox, ha declarado recientemente que su formación hará 'que toda la prensa pueda ser libre', buscando así transmitir una imagen de defensa de la libertad informativa en España. Sin embargo, estas palabras han sido ampliamente cuestionadas, sobre todo en el programa 'Malas Lenguas', donde se recurrió a declaraciones pasadas tanto de Abascal como de otros miembros de Vox para subrayar las contradicciones del partido respecto a la libertad de prensa. Se recordó que, poco tiempo atrás, Vox había mostrado un deseo explícito de cerrar espacios informativos críticos como ese propio programa, lo que deja en evidencia un doble discurso evidente. Además, se citaron comentarios desafiantes de Manuel Mariscal, diputado de Vox, sobre 'entrar en RTVE con motosierra o lanzallamas', poniendo de manifiesto la postura beligerante que algunos miembros de Vox tienen hacia medios públicos.

Este fraude dejó sin salarios a empleados de Fintopio y a inversionistas de China y el Medio Oriente sin sus fondos. Según los informes, Novak se hacía pasar por amigo de Pavel Durov, fundador de Telegram, aunque esta relación nunca fue confirmada. La pareja fue asesinada en una villa alquilada en la ciudad de Hatta, donde, bajo el pretexto de reunirse con posibles inversores, fueron atrapados por los criminales que exigieron la clave del monedero criptográfico de Novak.

La decisión de la jueza Karin Immergut, designada por el propio Trump, concluye que el despliegue de tropas violaba la autoridad de los gobiernos estatal y local, lo que representa una derrota para el mandatario republicano. Esta sentencia pone fin a semanas de litigios sobre la legalidad de las acciones federales en ciudades sin el consentimiento de las autoridades locales. La jueza destacó que la intervención de las tropas no estaba justificada, ya que no existían evidencias de que las protestas fueran una amenaza significativa para la seguridad pública ni que dificultaran la aplicación de las leyes migratorias.

En total, más de 140.000 personas fueron asesinadas por los sublevados y la dictadura hasta 1950, mientras que más de 49.000 murieron a manos de los republicanos. A pesar de los avances en la recuperación de la memoria histórica, los cuerpos de muchas de estas víctimas siguen enterrados sin una sepultura digna, en lugares como cementerios, cunetas y campos. A partir del año 2000, se comenzaron a realizar exhumaciones científicas, destacando la de Priaranza del Bierzo como un hito en este proceso. En 2014, la ONU instó a España a continuar buscando a los desaparecidos. Hasta la fecha, se han recuperado los restos de más de 17.000 personas, y se estima que otras 12.000 podrían ser exhumadas en el futuro.

En particular, se analizan casos como el de la DANA en Valencia en 2024, el Yak-42, el 11M, y los casos de mujeres afectadas por negligencias en mamografías en Andalucía. En todos estos casos, el PP ha mostrado una actitud de indiferencia, incluso acusando a las víctimas de politizar sus tragedias o cuestionando su sufrimiento. Esta tendencia de maltrato hacia las víctimas es parte de un patrón sistemático de la derecha española, según el autor. La crítica abarca la actitud del PP en el Congreso, donde los diputados de este partido se negaron a aplaudir a los familiares de las víctimas de la DANA, mostrando así un total desdén por el dolor ajeno.

Se destaca el aumento de casos de deserción, con 110.000 registradas solo en 2025, y el fenómeno del 'escaqueo' masivo, donde más de seis millones de hombres en edad militar eludieron su responsabilidad al no actualizar sus datos de registro. Además, se abordan las prácticas de corrupción dentro de los centros de reclutamiento y el uso de sobornos para evitar la movilización.

Aunque la mayoría de las personas sabe que el tabaco es una causa conocida de cáncer, el alcohol sigue siendo una amenaza menos reconocida. En una encuesta a más de 6.700 personas, el 52,9% respondió que no sabía si el alcohol influía en el riesgo de cáncer, mientras que solo un 37,1% reconoció su efecto negativo. Esta desinformación es preocupante, ya que las creencias erróneas sobre la relación entre el alcohol y el cáncer podrían llevar a la gente a mantener hábitos perjudiciales. El estudio también identificó que los fumadores, las personas con menos nivel educativo y los que consumen alcohol habitualmente son los más propensos a subestimar este riesgo.

Los datos recogidos permiten estudiar la dinámica de la marea estelar durante la fase de espaguetización y la rápida liberación de energía, que se tradujo en una emisión de rayos y luz en varias longitudes de onda. Este tipo de eventos, aunque raros, aporta información clave sobre la tasa de consumo de materia por los agujeros negros y la influencia de estos objetos en la evolución de galaxias.

Este proyecto distópico, promovido por la Fundación Heritage y el Programa 2025, plantea una respuesta radical frente a una crisis civilizatoria y se posiciona como un desafío global contra el cambio de ciclo histórico en Occidente. En su núcleo, el trumpismo propone un autoritarismo extremo, con políticas de represión, persecución de opositores y medidas que destruyen derechos fundamentales como la inmigración, los derechos de género y el bienestar social. En el ámbito económico, promueve un neoliberalismo radical, con recortes fiscales a los más ricos y un gasto social reducido, lo que profundiza las desigualdades sociales.

Además, ha compartido imágenes con el presidente del club, Florentino Pérez, lo que añade controversia a la relación del Real Madrid con la extrema derecha en España. Quiles, quien elogió públicamente a Pérez y sus valores, es otro de los personajes que alienta las conexiones entre el fútbol y el fascismo, especialmente en el contexto del club madridista. A pesar de la insistencia de algunos sectores de la sociedad en que los ultras y los fascistas han sido expulsados del Bernabéu, la realidad parece más compleja.

La corona graminea, una de las más prestigiosas, solo podía ser otorgada por los propios soldados a un comandante que hubiera salvado a todo un ejército. Estas condecoraciones también eran un medio para ascender en la vida política, ya que los veteranos las exhibían en sus campañas y desfiles.

La situación es especialmente grave para Cataluña, ya que algunas de las reformas bloqueadas incluyen la financiación singular y la quita de la deuda autonómica, demandas históricas de la Generalitat.

Desde acusaciones sobre su 'vivir de pagas' hasta la afirmación de que 'les regalan casas', los bulos se propagan fácilmente a través de redes sociales y medios de comunicación. Sin embargo, los datos oficiales contradicen estas afirmaciones. Según el INE, en España residen casi siete millones de extranjeros, de los cuales la gran mayoría está trabajando legalmente, contribuyendo a sectores clave como la hostelería, agricultura y construcción. La mayoría de los migrantes sin papeles, que no tienen acceso a ayudas, sobreviven gracias a trabajos en la economía sumergida. En cuanto a la obtención de la nacionalidad española, el proceso está claramente regulado y no es tan sencillo como algunos sugieren. Además, se destaca el racismo inmobiliario y las dificultades para los migrantes en el acceso a vivienda.

Tras su regreso al poder en 2022, el presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ha intensificado los esfuerzos para frenar la tala ilegal de bosques por parte de mineros, madereros y agricultores. Estas acciones han permitido que la deforestación en la Amazonía brasileña alcance su nivel más bajo en más de una década. La deforestación y la ganadería son las principales fuentes de emisiones del país. Según un informe del Observatorio del Clima, la caída de las emisiones fue del 16,7 % en 2023, lo que refleja la recuperación del control gubernamental sobre la deforestación tras los años de descontrol bajo la presidencia de Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022).

Aunque se presenta como una manifestación pacífica y religiosa, en realidad fue un acto estratégico respaldado por el régimen de Hassan II de Marruecos y apoyado indirectamente por Estados Unidos. La marcha, que movilizó a más de 350.000 civiles marroquíes, fue una presión directa sobre España para que abandonara el territorio saharaui y entregara la soberanía a Marruecos. A pesar de que la ONU había dictaminado que el Sáhara no formaba parte de Marruecos, el régimen marroquí utilizó la movilización como una excusa para la invasión. El resultado fue la división del pueblo saharaui, la ocupación marroquí y el exilio masivo. 50 años después, la resolución de la ONU ha dado un giro al conflicto, reconociendo el plan de autonomía marroquí y excluyendo el referéndum de autodeterminación.

Tras escapar y ser recapturado, se le ofrece participar en el brutal programa televisivo 'Perseguido', donde prisioneros son cazados por gladiadores en un juego mortal. Dirigida por Paul Michael Glaser, la película mezcla acción, sátira social y un tono caricaturesco, lo que le otorga una atmósfera algo kitsch y desconectada de las intenciones del guion original de Stephen King.

A lo largo del artículo, se detalla cómo el presidente afirmó que los precios son más bajos bajo su administración y que la inflación es una cuestión que su equipo intenta gestionar ante un público y una prensa atentos. Leavitt, descrita como la más joven en su cargo, asume un papel destacado al defender la agenda de asequibilidad y a la vez enfrentar preguntas sobre datos económicos, como el Índice de Precios al Consumo y los precios de los alimentos. El texto también señala un intercambio con el primer ministro húngaro, Viktor Orban, que se une en tono jocoso a la conversación y sugiere que Leavitt podría trabajar para Orban, una ocurrencia que añade un toque de humor a la cobertura.

El presidente del Comité Ejecutivo de Ifema Madrid, José Vicente de los Mozos, informó que hasta ahora se han vendido alrededor de 50.000 entradas para las carreras previstas del 11 al 13 de septiembre de 2026, con un resto que no saldrá a la venta hasta la campaña de Navidad. Los precios de las entradas oscilan entre 544 y 986 euros para abonos de tres días y entrenamientos, y las zonas más económicas y más caras ya no están disponibles. Además, se destaca que gran parte del aforo previsto continúa sin vender, mientras las negociaciones y acuerdos con socios como AMES, TAG Heuer o el Atlético de Madrid siguen en curso.

El evento, ubicado a unos 11 kilómetros de profundidad, ha sido detectado por el Instituto Volcanológico de Canarias (INVOLCAN). Aunque no se pudo determinar la magnitud exacta del temblor mediante técnicas convencionales, se estima que la intensidad fue de alrededor de 2,2 en la escala de Richter. Este tipo de temblores, conocidos como sismos LP (de largo período), se caracterizan por vibraciones de baja frecuencia y por la ausencia o atenuación de las fases sísmicas habituales. En este caso, los expertos explican que están asociados al movimiento de fluidos hidrotermales dentro del volcán, parte de un proceso de presurización que lleva observándose desde 2016. Aunque este tipo de eventos no activan alertas de erupción por sí solos, la repetición de los mismos y la ocurrencia de enjambres sísmicos de naturaleza híbrida en la zona mant]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-temblor-inedito-en-el-teide-supera-todos-los-registros-anteriores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-temblor-inedito-en-el-teide-supera-todos-los-registros-anteriores</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 01:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Despidos y condiciones laborales irregulares en las obras del Camp Nou: trabajadores sin permisos de trabajo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En las obras del Camp Nou, 13 trabajadores fueron despedidos de manera verbal sin ningún documento por parte de la empresa Extreme Works UAB, subcontratada por Limak, tras participar en una protesta en la que denunciaron la falta de permisos de trabajo. Los obreros, originarios de Turquía, llevan más de un año en Barcelona, pero no cuentan con la documentación adecuada. A pesar de tener permisos de residencia de otros países de la UE, no tienen los permisos laborales correspondientes. La denuncia del sindicato CCOO subraya que estos trabajadores no solo carecen de contrato formal, sino que tampoco han cotizado a la seguridad social ni tienen derecho a indemnización. Además, se está investigando si la empresa ha incurrido en infracciones laborales.

Además, otros vecinos y expertos legales relataron la presión y el racismo que sufren los latinos y la impotencia de las autoridades locales, quienes, aunque podrían colaborar con ICE mediante acuerdos como el 287(g), no tienen competencias para frenar las detenciones federales.

Sin embargo, su declaración no pasó desapercibida y el periodista José Miguel Villaroya lo criticó en el programa Malas Lenguas de RTVE.

A través de experimentos en laboratorio, el estudio demuestra que esta cepa produce una enzima llamada L-asparaginasa que transforma el aminoácido L-asparagina en aspartato y amonio. La liberación de amonio ha mostrado tener efectos citotóxicos relevantes sobre cultivos celulares de riñón embrionario humano (HEK 293 T), con una reducción significativa de la viabilidad celular. Además, se ha comprobado en modelos de nematodos (Caenorhabditis elegans) que la bacteria es capaz de colonizar de manera rápida y mantenida el tracto reproductivo de estos animales, ocasionando cierta mortalidad. El trabajo caracteriza la enzima bacteriana como halotolerante y especialmente activa en medios alcalinos, además de mostrar una alta similitud con otras asparaginasas marinas.

Según los datos de la encuesta, un 65% de los simpatizantes de Aliança Catalana y un 55% de los de Vox muestran un perfil conspiranoico. Este fenómeno se relaciona con un escepticismo generalizado hacia la información proporcionada por expertos e instituciones, que se ve reemplazada por creencias en realidades ocultas. Además, los votantes con estas características son más propensos a informarse a través de las redes sociales y a confiar en fuentes no convencionales. La encuesta también destaca que los votantes más jóvenes, especialmente los hombres, tienden a valorar más el nivel de vida que la democracia, un hecho que refleja una creciente tendencia autoritaria en la sociedad catalana.

Sin embargo, aunque este modelo es el preferido por muchos debido a su precio accesible, no refleja la realidad económica del país. A pesar de que se tiende a asociar la popularidad del Sandero con la pobreza, los datos muestran que los españoles gastan un promedio de 33.251 euros en sus coches, una cifra considerablemente mayor que el precio base del Sandero, que ronda los 15.000 euros. Según el economista Manuel Hidalgo, la media de los coches vendidos en España está más cerca de los 30.000 euros, lo que desmiente la idea de que la compra del Dacia Sandero es una señal de pobreza. Además, el mercado de coches está influenciado por las flotas de empresas, que a menudo compran vehículos a precios más bajos, lo que distorsiona aún más las estadísticas.

La presión mediática generada por esta manipulación provocó que la Fiscalía publicara una nota oficial aclarando los hechos, y que el Tribunal Supremo iniciara una investigación sobre si se había cometido un delito al divulgar el contenido de un correo del abogado de González Amador.

Qué debes saber sobre el combustible restante]]></title><description><![CDATA[La luz de reserva del combustible es una de las señales más temidas por los conductores, pero no siempre significa que estés a punto de quedarte sin gasolina. Cuando la luz se enciende, en realidad todavía queda un 10% de combustible en el depósito, lo que equivale a unos 5-10 litros, dependiendo del coche. Esto te permitiría recorrer entre 40 y 80 kilómetros antes de quedarte sin combustible. Sin embargo, continuar conduciendo en estas condiciones no es recomendable para la salud del motor, ya que el combustible restante puede estar lleno de impurezas y residuos. Si sigues conduciendo hasta agotar el depósito, podrías dañar la bomba de combustible, los inyectores o el filtro, lo que podría llevar a fallos mecánicos costosos. Lo ideal es repostar cuando el indicador marque un cuarto del depósito para evitar problemas a largo plazo.

Sin embargo, lo que debería haber sido un proceso rutinario se ha convertido en una tragedia para millones de personas, que enfrentan aumentos drásticos en sus primas o la pérdida total de su cobertura médica. Esto se debe a la decisión del Congreso de no renovar las subvenciones públicas aprobadas durante la pandemia, que ayudaban a los ciudadanos a costear sus seguros privados. El precio medio de las primas ha aumentado significativamente, y sin la ayuda pública, más de 4 millones de personas se quedarán sin seguro médico, lo que aumenta la desigualdad social en un país donde la salud es tratada como un negocio. La política fiscal actual beneficia a las grandes corporaciones y los hogares más ricos, mientras que recorta los fondos destinados a los más vulnerables, lo que agrava aún más la brecha entre ricos y pobres en el acceso a la salud.

Este avance representa un hito, ya que el modelo no solo iguala, sino que supera a los mejores sistemas propietarios de OpenAI, Google y Anthropic en varios tests de referencia. Destacan especialmente los resultados en Humanity's Last Exam y BrowserComp, donde logra las puntuaciones más altas. Kimi K2 Thinking también se desempeña con notable eficacia en tareas agénticas, obteniendo resultados sobresalientes en simulaciones de atención al cliente. Además del rendimiento, el coste de entrenamiento ha sido de solo 4,6 millones de dólares, cifra muy inferior comparada con los 500 millones estimados para GPT-5, lo que hace a Kimi K2 Thinking mucho más accesible.

En los últimos tres años, el Producto Interno Bruto apenas creció un 1,44%, lo que revela una profunda falta de dinamismo en su economía. Además, el país pierde un promedio de 126.000 habitantes anualmente, lo que afecta la productividad y el consumo interno. La competencia de China se ha convertido en una amenaza cada vez mayor, ya que el gigante asiático avanza en tecnología y producción de bienes que antes eran exclusivos de Italia, como los productos 'Made in Italy'. Este fenómeno se combina con un mercado laboral estancado y un sistema productivo que no logra adaptarse a los nuevos desafíos globales. La situación se agrava con el bajo crecimiento de otros países de la eurozona, como Alemania, que sigue en recesión, mientras que naciones como España y Grecia muestran un crecimiento superior.

Recientemente, agentes del ICE irrumpieron en una guardería y arrestaron a una educadora, lo que ha generado indignación en la comunidad. Desde que Donald Trump asumió la presidencia, las políticas migratorias se han endurecido, aumentando las detenciones, incluso de personas sin antecedentes penales, y generando críticas por violaciones de derechos humanos en los centros de detención. La situación ha llegado a tal punto que algunas organizaciones de derechos humanos, como Human Rights Watch, denuncian abusos sistemáticos, como las largas horas de detención sin acceso a comida ni agua, y el uso de la fuerza excesiva por parte de los agentes. Con la aprobación de una ley que permite al ICE operar sin supervisión y con fondos ilimitados, la situación parece estar f]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ice-intensifica-sus-redadas-y-la-persecucion-a-inmigrantes-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ice-intensifica-sus-redadas-y-la-persecucion-a-inmigrantes-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 21:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Concurso internacional para proteger el Templo de Debod tras preocupación por su conservación]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Templo de Debod, ubicado en Madrid, ha sido objeto de creciente preocupación por su estado de conservación debido a la erosión, la contaminación, el vandalismo y la falta de mantenimiento adecuado.

A pesar de que gran parte del pueblo neerlandés era católico, la elite protestante, apoyada por otros países protestantes como Inglaterra, utilizó la religión como una herramienta para movilizar a la población contra el imperio español. En realidad, el conflicto era una lucha de poder entre los nobles y la monarquía española, disfrazada de una guerra religiosa. La figura de Guillermo de Orange se elevó como el líder de la rebelión, aunque sus intereses políticos y los de los nobles neerlandeses estaban muy lejos de representar un verdadero anhelo de libertad para el pueblo. A lo largo de la guerra de los 80 años, la propaganda rebelde moldeó la percepción europea del conflicto, presentando a los españoles como los villanos, mientras que las violaciones de derechos cometidas por los rebeldes fueron minimizadas.

El Partido Popular ha votado en varias ocasiones en contra de medidas similares en los últimos años, como la reforma de pensiones de 2021 y el real decreto de este enero, que regulaban la revalorización de las pensiones según el IPC. A pesar de esto, Feijóo se presenta ahora como defensor de los pensionistas, argumentando que el Gobierno carece de mayoría y proyecto para gobernar. Sin embargo, desde el Ministerio de la Seguridad Social han recordado que las pensiones ya están garantizadas por ley y que no es necesaria una nueva reforma.

Huang subraya que Occidente, incluida EE. UU. y Reino Unido, ha mostrado cinismo y necesidad de más optimismo para mantener el liderazgo tecnológico. El informe detalla que Pekín ha aumentado los subsidios energéticos para grandes centros de datos gestionados por gigantes chinos como ByteDance, Alibaba y Tencent, lo que reduce el coste de operar infraestructuras de IA. En este contexto, Estados Unidos mantiene restricciones sobre la venta de chips avanzados a China, y la administración de Trump ha dejado claro que algunos productos no serán accesibles fuera del país.

La condición fue impuesta como requisito para firmar el contrato de arrendamiento, bajo la amenaza de no poder alquilar la vivienda sin dicho pago. El juez ha calificado esta práctica como 'engañosa y coercitiva', ya que los inquilinos no recibieron información clara ni transparente sobre el servicio, el cual resultó ser prácticamente inexistente. Además, se ha subrayado que los gastos derivados del alquiler deben ser asumidos por el propietario, no por el inquilino. Esta sentencia se produce en un contexto de creciente preocupación por los abusos en el mercado de alquiler, con investigaciones en curso por parte del Ministerio de Consumo, que ya había propuesto una sanción económica a Alquiler Seguro por sus prácticas ilegales.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-ordena-a-alquiler-seguro-devolver-el-cobro-de-un-servicio-abusivo-e-innecesario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-ordena-a-alquiler-seguro-devolver-el-cobro-de-un-servicio-abusivo-e-innecesario</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La ciberseguridad del Louvre: contraseñas evidentes y sistemas obsoletos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una auditoría interna realizada en 2014 desveló la alarmante falta de seguridad en el Louvre, revelando que algunos de los sistemas clave del museo usaban contraseñas extremadamente simples, como 'LOUVRE' para acceder al servidor de videovigilancia. Además, varios de los ordenadores del museo operaban con versiones desfasadas de Windows, como Windows 2000, que ya no reciben actualizaciones de seguridad. Aunque no se ha comprobado que estas vulnerabilidades estuvieran relacionadas con el reciente robo de joyas en el museo, el informe de la Agencia Nacional de Seguridad de los Sistemas de Información de Francia (ANSSI) deja claro que el museo no había actualizado sus sistemas de forma adecuada. A pesar de las advertencias de los técnicos, las medidas adoptadas por el Louvre para reforzar la seguridad pudieron haber sido solo parciales o temporales.

Este fenómeno no es exclusivo de los turrones, ya que otros dulces navideños también han experimentado subidas de precios similares, como el turrón crujiente Dulce Noel. Aunque las empresas justifican los aumentos debido a los elevados costes de fabricación, como el encarecimiento del cacao y otros ingredientes, muchos consumidores perciben que el precio por kilo se ha disparado considerablemente.

A través de cartas inéditas y documentos secretos, Anton reconstruyó la trama que permitió que el famoso 'Ángel de la Muerte' viviera en Brasil sin ser atrapado por el Mossad ni la CIA. En su investigación, Anton descubrió que Liselotte Bossert, su propia profesora de primaria, fue una de las personas que le ofreció refugio y lo protegió durante los últimos años de su vida. El caso de Mengele, conocido por los horrendos experimentos que realizó en Auschwitz, estuvo cubierto por una red de exiliados nazis en Latinoamérica que proporcionaron un entorno seguro para él.

Mientras muchos países europeos restringen la entrada de extranjeros, España se mantiene como uno de los pocos destinos abiertos a la inmigración. En contraste, Portugal ha cerrado sus puertas a inmigrantes, endureciendo sus leyes de extranjería y ciudadanía, lo que podría afectar a su mercado laboral. La falta de trabajadores está llevando a una disminución de la tasa de desempleo, pero también a una disminución de la población activa, lo que podría frenar el crecimiento económico.

La caída de la natalidad en los últimos años ha sido alarmante, con una tasa de 1,12 hijos por mujer en 2024, una de las más bajas de Europa. Este fenómeno se ha visto reflejado especialmente en el aumento de nacimientos de madres mayores de 40 años, que ha crecido un 20% en la última década. La inseguridad económica, la precariedad laboral y la falta de proyectos compartidos entre las parejas son algunos de los principales factores detrás de este cambio demográfico. Según la experta Dolores López, la falta de esperanza en el futuro y la fragilidad de las relaciones afectan gravemente a la decisión de ser padres. La falta de un proyecto común entre las parejas y la creciente individualización en la sociedad dificultan la paternidad.

Se destacan ejemplos como la enseñanza de religión en centros financiados con fondos públicos, la financiación mediante IRPF y el reconocimiento del matrimonio canónico con efectos civiles.

La Fundación Madrina, conocida por su activismo antiabortista, ha sido criticada por esta práctica, ya que busca asesorar a estas mujeres para disuadirlas de abortar, lo que ha generado controversia. El presidente de la Fundación, Conrado Jiménez, es conocido por sus vínculos con grupos ultracatólicos y su postura en contra de los derechos reproductivos. Aunque la Fundación presenta su trabajo como un acto de caridad para ayudar a las familias en situación de vulnerabilidad, su agenda ideológica ha suscitado indignación entre activistas locales, que denuncian que estas acciones son un intento de manipulación de las personas más necesitadas para fines políticos y religiosos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fundacion-madrina-ofrece-comida-a-cambio-de-datos-de-mujeres-embarazadas-migrantes-en-valencia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fundacion-madrina-ofrece-comida-a-cambio-de-datos-de-mujeres-embarazadas-migrantes-en-valencia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 10:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zohran Mamdani gana la alcaldía de Nueva York; el voto judío favorece a Cuomo en más de dos tercios]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza la elección para la alcaldía de Nueva York en la que Zohran Mamdani, un activista de extrema izquierda y legislador estatal abiertamente crítico con Israel, fue elegido alcalde convirtiéndose en el líder musulmán más joven de la ciudad. Tras la victoria, Mamdani enfrentó un marco de cautela y preocupación por parte de las principales entidades judías estadounidenses, que expresaron la necesidad de vigilar de cerca su mandato para asegurar que se combata el antisemitismo y se protejan los derechos de la comunidad judía. Una encuesta de la CNN citada por la pieza indica que, aunque Mamdani ganó, el 63% de los votantes judíos respaldó al exgobernador Andrew Cuomo y solo un 33% apoyó a Mamdani. A pesar de la oposición de algunos grupos y de críticas hacia su postura sobre Israel, Mamdani prometió luchar contra el antisemitismo y promover políticas progresistas como transporte público mejorado, guarderías gratuitas y modelos de seguridad comunitaria.

La tecnología en cuestión, sensores de vigilancia fabricados por la división Wescam de L3 Harris, habría sido utilizada para coordinar ataques aéreos que causaron la muerte de varios pescadores en aguas colombianas y venezolanas. Esta compañía, que tiene una larga relación comercial con el Pentágono, ha sido señalada de contribuir indirectamente en la ejecución de lo que se consideran ejecuciones extrajudiciales, específicamente en los casos de Alejandro Carranza y otros pescadores. A pesar de que Canadá es signatario de tratados internacionales que prohíben la exportación de tecnología militar para fines de represión y violaciones de derechos humanos, el Acuerdo de Compartición de Producción de Defensa con EE.

Mamdani, un socialista democrático de 34 años, ganó las elecciones con el 50,4% de los votos, convirtiéndose en el alcalde más joven de la historia de la ciudad. La polémica surgió por el apoyo de Mamdani a Palestina, algo que Messing, defensora del Estado de Israel, no dudó en atacar públicamente. La actriz compartió memes y vídeos ofensivos, incluso utilizando el término 'Osama bin Mamdani' y sugiriendo que el nuevo alcalde era un 'yihadista' comunista. Sus publicaciones, que han sido calificadas de islamófobas, han desatado una tormenta en las redes sociales, donde se le acusa de contribuir a la división y el odio.

Sin embargo, a pesar de estos impactos cada vez más evidentes, la preocupación ciudadana por el calentamiento global ha disminuido en los últimos años. Según diversos estudios, la preocupación ha caído significativamente en países europeos como España, Francia y Alemania. El profesor Pablo Ángel Meira Cartea señala que esta desconexión se debe, en parte, a la politización del cambio climático y a la propagación de mensajes negacionistas que confunden a la población. Además, los ciudadanos sienten que no pueden hacer nada efectivo frente a este problema, lo que limita su motivación para actuar. En particular, los jóvenes, un grupo con acceso a la información, están mostrando una creciente indiferencia hacia la crisis climática, lo que representa una preocupación a largo plazo.

Mediante técnicas avanzadas de proteómica y bioinformática, el estudio reveló que la sobreexpresión de TMOD2 en células tumorales está asociada a una mayor capacidad de metástasis especialmente hacia el hígado. Los investigadores han constatado que TMOD2 no solo favorece la adhesión celular y el crecimiento tumoral, sino también la formación de tumores de mayor tamaño y la mayor colonización hepática en modelos tanto 'in vitro' como en animales.

Francisco, quien ha denunciado que su ex pareja le presentó falsas acusaciones de malos tratos, teme por el bienestar de sus hijos, especialmente porque Grethel tiene problemas de salud mental. La desaparición ocurrió tras un juicio que iba a quitarle la custodia de Francisco, lo que habría agravado su situación. La Policía Judicial de Torrevieja investiga el caso y rastrea posibles movimientos internacionales de los niños. Este caso ha conmocionado a la comunidad de Torrevieja, y los padres de los menores, unidos en la búsqueda, temen que los niños hayan sido trasladados fuera de España.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francisco-busca-a-sus-hijos-tras-la-desaparicion-de-su-madre-en-torrevieja</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francisco-busca-a-sus-hijos-tras-la-desaparicion-de-su-madre-en-torrevieja</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 20:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La desaceleración económica en EE.

Actualmente, 22 estados y el Distrito de Columbia están en recesión o muy cerca de entrar en ella, lo que afecta a casi el 90% de la población estadounidense. Las señales de desaceleración son claras: el crecimiento de empleo se está desacelerando, los salarios están estancados y el mercado inmobiliario se ha suavizado. Sectores clave como la manufactura, la agricultura y el transporte están luchando debido a la fluctuación de la demanda global, problemas con la cadena de suministro y los costos crecientes. La caída en la construcción de viviendas ha afectado gravemente a los empleos locales y a las pequeñas empresas dependientes del sector. Además, aunque algunos estados todavía crecen, las dificultades económicas a nivel regional están tocando a casi todos los ciudadanos, reduciendo oportunidades laborales y haciendo más difícil el acceso a viviendas. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-desaceleracion-economica-en-ee-uu-afecta-a-la-mayoria-de-los-estados-con-22-en-recesion-o-cerca-de-ella</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-desaceleracion-economica-en-ee-uu-afecta-a-la-mayoria-de-los-estados-con-22-en-recesion-o-cerca-de-ella</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 19:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Supremo establece que las empresas no pueden modificar unilateralmente los horarios de trabajo sin acuerdo previo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo ha dictado una sentencia clave en defensa de los derechos laborales al establecer que las empresas no pueden imponer cambios sustanciales en los horarios de trabajo sin un pacto previo con los empleados. En este caso, la empresa Konecta intentó ampliar la jornada laboral de lunes a viernes, añadiendo fines de semana sin negociarlo con los representantes de los trabajadores. Aunque el contrato de los empleados mencionaba una disponibilidad 'de lunes a domingo', la práctica habitual había sido trabajar solo de lunes a viernes durante años, lo que consolidó un derecho al descanso durante los fines de semana. La sentencia subraya que la práctica laboral consolidada prevalece sobre lo que está escrito en el contrato, y cualquier cambio que afecte a la jornada de trabajo debe ser negociado según el artículo 41 del Estatuto de los Trabajadores.

Imágenes que muestran animales tiroteados o envenenados han generado una ola de indignación internacional. El Partido Animalista PACMA ha liderado la campaña, pidiendo la intervención de la FIFA y la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF), señalando que las matanzas se han intensificado desde que Marruecos fue designado coanfitrión del evento. PACMA ha iniciado una recogida de firmas y ha solicitado una reunión con la RFEF para pedir respuestas claras. Aunque el gobierno marroquí ha comenzado a invertir en la protección animal y está tramitando una ley nacional de bienestar animal, las matanzas continúan, y las autoridades locales, según PACMA, no están abordando adecuadamente el problema.

Por otro lado, Reliant, desarrollado por exmilitares en Tel Aviv, se presenta como columna vertebral del espionaje de la Guardia Civil.

El abogado sostiene que estas citas podrían ayudar a esclarecer si hubo posibles falsos testimonios y a determinar responsabilidades penales.

Posteriormente, la referencia fue eliminada del sitio, y la versión archivada conserva parte del texto.

Más de dos mil presos políticos pasaron por las caballerizas del Palacio durante la Guerra Civil, enfrentando condiciones deplorables, hacinamiento, hambre y represiones; se crearon secciones organizadas y se utilizó para retener a sospechosos sin juicio, con trabajo forzado y programas de reeducación. El entorno social de la época contrastaba con la represión: la élite local disfrutaba de clubes y lujos desde los ventanales del recinto, mientras los presos eran obligados a cantar el Cara al Sol y a rendir honores a la bandera.

En este contexto, la revista 'El Jueves' ha lanzado una portada provocadora en la que aparece Franco junto a dos perros, que representan a Isabel Díaz Ayuso y Santiago Abascal. Mientras que el perro que simboliza a Abascal es retratado de forma feroz, el de Ayuso tiene una imagen más amable, aunque el mensaje que se transmite es claro: 'Nos tiene atados y bien atados'. La portada, además, muestra la figura del dictador con una medalla que lo distingue como el 'mejor yayo', y utiliza referencias a la Cruz del Valle de los Caídos y a la cultura popular como el 'Ojo de Sauron' para dar un toque de humor negro a la pieza.

El incidente ocurrió en un restaurante McDonald’s, donde un hombre y su hermana, tras ver a los chicos, comenzaron a grabarlos. La hermana se asustó pensando que eran agentes reales, lo que también inquietó a varios empleados hispanos del local. Los adolescentes admitieron haber estado persiguiendo a las personas y se mostraron despectivos, riéndose mientras confirmaban que estaban simulando ser agentes.

Sin embargo, la protesta también incluyó a trabajadores del Hotel Senator Marbella y sindicalistas que reclamaban mejoras laborales.

Según Sara Cucala, experta en gastronomía, la clave está en conocer algunas técnicas culinarias que mejoren el sabor y la calidad de los platos. Entre sus recomendaciones se destacan aspectos como la correcta cocción de la carne, el uso adecuado de las especias, y cómo evitar que las verduras se cocinen en exceso. Además, Cucala sugiere que no es necesario ser un chef profesional para mejorar los resultados, solo es cuestión de dedicar un poco más de tiempo y de seguir algunos trucos sencillos. Para conseguir una pechuga de pollo jugosa, recomienda sellarla en sartén caliente y dejarla reposar antes de cortarla. Las verduras, por su parte, deben mantenerse crujientes, y el pescado debe cocinarse a baja temperatura para evitar que se reseque. También explica cómo hacer frituras de forma saludable controlando la temperatura del aceite.

Mientras tanto, las comunidades han tenido que derivar a pacientes a la sanidad privada, incurriendo en grandes gastos. En total, se han destinado millones de euros para atender a personas que necesitan este tratamiento, una inversión que podría haberse evitado si las máquinas estuvieran operativas. Aunque algunas comunidades como Galicia comenzarán a tratar pacientes en 2026, la mayoría no lo hará hasta 2027 o 2029.

Parte significativa de esa pérdida se debe a movimientos de beneficios hacia paraísos fiscales y jurisdicciones con impuestos bajos, especialmente por multinacionales con sede en Estados Unidos, que trasladaron al exterior gran parte de sus beneficios y, en algunos casos, redujeron su tipo efectivo impositivo gracias a reformas como la de 2017 en EE.UU. que redujo el impuesto de sociedades.

La portavoz Míriam Nogueras afirmó que no respaldarán las 21 leyes en tramitación y que las futuras leyes aprobadas por el Consejo de Ministros también serán objeto de enmiendas a la totalidad. La medida busca obligar a acuerdos y evidencia una ruptura con el Ejecutivo, señalando que sin los votos de Junts no se podrán aprobar medidas, incluido el presupuesto. El Gobierno mantiene que ha cumplido lo que está en su mano y que, para lo demás, sigue trabajando “votación a votación”. La posición de Junts complica la agenda de Moncloa y puede afectar la aprobación de iniciativas como leyes de atención a la dependencia y otras normativas clave. Aun así, Junts salvaguarda algunas leyes ya acordadas y aquellas que ya están en trámite en el Senado.

Este proceso, que se realiza en secreto, esconde las negociaciones que definen las penas sin la intervención del juez. A pesar de que el artículo 120 de la Constitución establece que las actuaciones judiciales deben ser públicas, la práctica de los acuerdos de conformidad incumple este principio fundamental de transparencia. La falta de visibilidad de estas negociaciones permite que surjan abusos, chantajes o favores entre las partes involucradas. Además, la sociedad desconoce si las decisiones judiciales son justas o si se basan en pruebas reales. Aunque este sistema ayuda a descongestionar los tribunales y ahorrar recursos, el déficit democrático que genera pone en entredicho la calidad del Estado de Derecho en España.

La sentencia, lograda por UGT Castilla-La Mancha tras un largo proceso judicial, establece que los empleados de empresas multiservicios deben recibir las mismas condiciones laborales que los de la empresa contratante, especialmente en cuanto al salario. Este fallo pone fin a una discriminación salarial histórica, donde trabajadores del sector logístico externalizado podían recibir hasta 7.000 euros menos al año que los empleados directos. La sentencia se considera un avance crucial para los derechos laborales, no solo en Castilla-La Mancha, sino a nivel nacional, al sentar un precedente jurídico que obliga a las empresas a aplicar los convenios sectoriales correspondientes.

El hallazgo se produjo durante una excavación arqueológica preventiva iniciada el 14 de julio y dirigida por Glenda Graziani Echávarri y Juan José Marí Casanova, con un equipo de tres arqueólogos y dieciséis operarios. La pieza, de estilo grecorromano y en excelente estado gracias al agua subterránea, fue encontrada dentro de un antiguo pozo (UE 205) que, en su fase final, funcionó como basurero. Además de la talla, se recuperaron fragmentos de madera, una suela de cuero y restos vegetales.

La Diócesis ha confirmado estas revelaciones, pero la postura del Padre Lute es clara: para él, solo el abuso que involucra penetración es considerado un crimen. La Iglesia parece minimizar el caso, sugiriendo que no se prioriza por no haber violación. Este enfoque ha generado controversia, pues se percibe como una relativización del daño a las víctimas, y una evidente falta de acción judicial ante el abuso. Los testimonios de los representantes eclesiásticos reflejan una preocupación mayor por la 'penalización' del sacerdote que por la reparación a las víctimas.

Las causas principales son la precariedad laboral y el incremento de los precios de la vivienda, aunque el informe señala múltiples factores como desigualdades heredadas, servicios públicos insuficientes y un mercado laboral que no garantiza salidas efectivas de la pobreza. Los datos destacan que el 29% de los menores sufre exclusión social y que muchos hogares en situación de exclusión moderada o severa tienen al menos un miembro con empleo, lo que subraya la desconexión entre ingresos y protección social.

Con picos de hasta 300 kW, esta tecnología promete hacer obsoletos los cargadores tradicionales al permitir que los vehículos se recarguen mientras circulan a alta velocidad. Este sistema, conocido como 'Charge as you Drive', funciona mediante carga inductiva y es capaz de proporcionar más de 200 kW de potencia de forma continua.

Garcia enfatiza que la desconexión emocional del joven suele ser una respuesta protectora ante un cerebro en plena reorganización: la zona emocional está hiperactiva y la racional aún se está formando. Ante ello, los padres deben evitar interpretar la conducta como desobediencia y en su lugar buscar un entorno seguro y comprensivo. El artículo propone que el primer paso para reconectar no sea hablar de inmediato, sino equilibrar al adulto, mostrar presencia emocional sin exigencias y evitar la confrontación. Se aconseja gestos consistentes que demuestren seguridad, una voz baja, respiración tranquila y miradas no críticas. Los límites deben ser coherentes y no arbitrarios, y la confianza se recupera con acciones que demuestren cambio y sostenimiento emocional. También se destaca la necesidad de respetar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-restablecer-la-conexion-con-tu-adolescente-claves-de-una-experta-en-neurociencia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-restablecer-la-conexion-con-tu-adolescente-claves-de-una-experta-en-neurociencia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 13:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los destinos más recomendados de España y Portugal para visitar en 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cada año, Condé Nast Traveler elige los destinos más destacados a nivel global y, para 2026, varios lugares en España y Portugal han sido seleccionados por su lujo, su belleza natural y su potencial para posicionarse como destinos de prestigio.

Esta medida afectará a todo el mundo, no solo a Estados Unidos, y permanecerá vigente hasta 2032. Además, Google reducirá sus comisiones a un 9 % o 20 %, dependiendo de las transacciones, y ofrecerá mayor flexibilidad en los medios de pago. Tim Sweeney, CEO de Epic Games, celebró el acuerdo, resaltando la visión de Android como una plataforma más abierta y competitiva frente al modelo cerrado de Apple.

El proyecto, que llevará por título 'Wasp 2026' (acrónimo de Woody Allen Summer Project 2026), tiene como requisito que la película se filme en Madrid y sus alrededores, mostrando localizaciones fácilmente identificables de la ciudad. Además, el título debe incluir la palabra 'Madrid'. Esta inversión se realizará en tres pagos, dependiendo de la difusión internacional de la película. Este tipo de iniciativas buscan potenciar el atractivo turístico de la ciudad, aprovechando el impacto mediático de una figura como Allen, cuya obra ha sido reconocida a nivel mundial.

La obra también señala que este fenómeno comenzó a notarse especialmente con la llegada de Francisco José Alcaraz a la AVT en 2004, cuando el grupo se alineó abiertamente con el PP y participó en movimientos conservadores.

Daureo asegura que los cortes más cortos son los que mejor funcionan, como los estilos midi, pixie, a lo garçon o los cortes shag. Estos cortes, que generalmente incorporan capas, proporcionan la apariencia de mayor cantidad de cabello y volumen.

Las razones incluyen el alto coste por episodio, que oscila entre 6 y 8 millones de dólares, y la percepción de que ciertos contenidos inclusivos podrían no encajar con la audiencia estadounidense. Disney no ha expresado posturas definitivas sobre estos temas, pero sí sugiere que una parte de la sociedad norteamericana rechaza estos enfoques. Ante este panorama, la BBC planea un reinicio de la serie para 2026, con un coste reducido por episodio de más de la mitad y posibles cambios en la plataforma de emisión.

El empresario, que ha sido acusado de defraudar más de 350.000 euros, había manifestado su dolor y la sensación de ser perseguido tras la filtración de un correo sobre su situación fiscal. Además, indicó que sentía que el proceso judicial tenía un trasfondo político debido a su relación con Ayuso. Losada, con ironía, le sugirió que, si no cometiera irregularidades fiscales, podría seguir viviendo tranquilamente en España, sin necesidad de huir ni recurrir a pensamientos extremos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anton-losada-ofrece-una-alternativa-a-alberto-gonzalez-amador-tras-sus-lamentaciones-en-el-juicio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anton-losada-ofrece-una-alternativa-a-alberto-gonzalez-amador-tras-sus-lamentaciones-en-el-juicio</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El legado del genocidio de Darfur y su ampliación a las masacres de Al-Fasher]]></title><description><![CDATA[La guerra en Sudán no es un conflicto reciente, sino una continuidad de las políticas raciales que se remontan a décadas atrás, cuando el Estado sudanés, con el apoyo de las milicias árabes janjawid, llevó a cabo el genocidio de Darfur. En 2003, las comunidades Fur, Masalit y Zaghawa fueron sistemáticamente atacadas: sus aldeas destruidas, hombres asesinados, mujeres violadas y marcadas como símbolo de humillación racial. Hoy, la actual RSF (Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido) sigue los mismos métodos, extendiendo la violencia a todo el país, con masacres como las de El Geneina, donde miles de personas fueron ejecutadas y mujeres violadas, marcadas o secuestradas. Esta violencia responde a un orden racial que clasifica a la población según su origen étnico: los árabes como superiores, y los africanos negros como desechables. El conflicto actual refleja siglos de esclavitud árabe en la región, durante los cuales Sudán fue un corredor de comercio de personas esclavizadas.

Según los datos, hasta 2019, el 63% de ellos cometieron algún delito, siendo el 19% condenado a prisión incondicional, el 16% a prisión condicional y el 65% a multas u otras sanciones. Además, se reveló que un 69% de este grupo de refugiados recibió algún tipo de asistencia social, como subsidios por desempleo o pensiones de jubilación anticipada. También se analizó a sus descendientes, donde se observó que aproximadamente un 34% de los 999 descendientes de este grupo tuvo problemas legales y un 37% recibió asistencia social, destacando en estos casos la ayuda para el estudio. Estos datos, provenientes de fuentes oficiales, han generado controversia y debate sobre el impacto de la inmigración en Dinamarca, especialmente en lo que respecta a la integración de los refugiados palestinos en la sociedad danesa.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudio-de-dinamarca-muestra-que-el-63-de-los-refugiados-palestinos-acogidos-en-1992-fueron-condenados-por-delitos-hasta-2019</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudio-de-dinamarca-muestra-que-el-63-de-los-refugiados-palestinos-acogidos-en-1992-fueron-condenados-por-delitos-hasta-2019</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 11:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La BBC accede a Gaza tras la ofensiva israelí: un paisaje de destrucción total]]></title><description><![CDATA[La corresponsal de la BBC en Oriente Medio, Lucy Williamson, describe cómo la ciudad de Gaza ha quedado devastada por los efectos de la guerra. Desde un terraplén que ofrece una vista panorámica de la ciudad, se observa un paisaje completamente arrasado por los bombardeos, con pocos edificios en pie. La zona visitada fue una de las primeras en ser ocupadas por las fuerzas israelíes durante las primeras semanas del conflicto, y las visitas posteriores han sido limitadas. Los periodistas fueron acompañados por las fuerzas israelíes y no pudieron hablar con los palestinos ni acceder a otras áreas. El portavoz militar israelí afirmó que el objetivo principal no era destruir la ciudad, sino combatir a los terroristas, aunque destacó que muchas de las viviendas contenían túneles y armas. La situación sigue siendo muy tensa, con intercambios de disparos casi a diario a lo largo de la llamada 'línea amarilla' que separa los territorios controlados por Israel y Hamás.

A través de ejemplos en un taller de escritura y experiencias docentes, la autora explora la relación entre lenguaje, identidad y frontera. Se discuten la influencia de las palabras en nuestra percepción de la realidad y la responsabilidad ética del escribir, así como la capacidad del lenguaje para crear posibilidades y, a la vez, frustraciones. El artículo aborda conceptos clave como la percepción del yo frente al tú, la diversidad de interpretaciones de palabras y la tensión entre claridad y ambigüedad lingüística. También critica la neolengua y los eufemismos utilizados para justificar acciones políticas u opresivas, citando referentes como Orwell y Morrison para subrayar que el lenguaje puede ser violencia si se usa para excluir o manipular.

Se destaca que, poco después de la dimisión de Carlos Mazón, se intensificaron las críticas por parte de dirigentes y opinadores afines, incluyendo a la dirección provincial del PP en Valencia. Se mencionan declaraciones que cuestionaban la independencia de las asociaciones y su supuesta politización, así como ataques personales hacia figuras como Rosa Álvarez y Mariló Gradolí. El reportaje recoge testimonios de víctimas como Dolores, María del Carmen Gil y Rosa Álvarez, que denuncian que las pérdidas humanas fueron evitables y que las obras de encauzamiento podrían haber mitigado daños, aunque no evitaron todas las muertes.

Según el informe de CCOO de Madrid, tres hospitales públicos gestionados por Quirón —el Rey Juan Carlos, Infanta Elena y el General de Villalba— han alcanzado beneficios millonarios. A pesar de esta inversión en el sector privado, la sanidad pública madrileña sigue enfrentando problemas como la precariedad laboral y un gasto sanitario por habitante inferior a la media nacional. Además, se denuncia la derivación masiva de mamografías a la sanidad privada y las largas listas de espera en hospitales públicos.

El Ayuntamiento comunicó el suceso a la Junta de Castilla y León, que abrió expediente y trasladará el caso a la Fiscalía para investigar si se trata de un delito de expolio o daños al patrimonio, penalizado con prisión de entre seis meses y tres años, además de posibles multas y sanciones económicas de hasta 600.000 euros según la Ley de Patrimonio autonómica.

Estos testimonios clave pusieron en duda que los correos fueran secretos cuando llegaron al fiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz. Según los periodistas, el correo con la confesión del empresario ya circulaba en diferentes redacciones días antes de que García Ortiz lo recibiera, lo que refuerza la posición de la Fiscalía y su defensa: el contenido ya estaba publicado en medios, así que no se trataba de un material reservado ni confidencial. El equipo de elDiario.es pudo acceder a la documentación relevante el 6 de marzo y tras revisiones internas, lanzó varias exclusivas revelando el fraude fiscal y la trama de facturas falsas, además de la vinculación de Ayuso con propiedades de lujo a través de sociedades opacas.

La mujer, que trabajaba en un hospital de Würselen, cerca de Aquisgrán, actuó entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024, administrando dosis mortales de sedantes y analgésicos a pacientes ancianos con el fin de reducir su carga de trabajo durante los turnos nocturnos. La enfermera se declaró culpable de los cargos y mostró poca empatía por las víctimas, lo que llevó a los fiscales a calificar sus crímenes como de 'culpabilidad especial'. El caso es similar al de Niels Hoegel, otro enfermero alemán condenado en 2019 por el asesinato de 85 pacientes, lo que coloca a estos enfermeros en el centro de un preocupante patrón de crímenes dentro del ámbito sanitario. Además, se están realizando exhumaciones para identificar a más posibles víctimas, y la enfermera podría enfrentarse a nuevos juicios en el futuro.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/enfermera-condenada-a-perpetua-por-asesinar-a-10-pacientes-e-intentar-matar-a-otros-27-en-alemania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/enfermera-condenada-a-perpetua-por-asesinar-a-10-pacientes-e-intentar-matar-a-otros-27-en-alemania</guid><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 09:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El recorrido global de la silla Monobloc: diseño, producción y cultura]]></title><description><![CDATA[La silla Monobloc, una pieza realizada en un solo bloque de plástico, es hoy un icono democrático presente en todo el mundo, conocida por su bajo coste, durabilidad y facilidad de limpieza. Su diseño y rápida fabricación —menos de dos minutos por unidad— permitieron su expansión global desde los años 80, llegando a playas, terrazas, mercados y hasta eventos culturales. Su historia arranca en la década de 1960, cuando la innovación en materiales y técnicas de moldeo impulsó modelos pioneros como la Panton Chair y la Selene, aunque fue la Fauteuil 300 de Henry Massonnet la que revolucionó el acceso masivo a este tipo de muebles. Desde entonces, la Monobloc se ha adaptado y multiplicado por fabricantes de todo el planeta, manteniendo la esencia de una silla apilable, cómoda y universal. Criticada en años recientes por su impacto ambiental debido al uso de plástico, su presencia se mantiene por su extrema funcionalidad y precio asequible.

Treinta años después, Países Bajos mantiene una economía sólida y Bélgica enfrenta una deuda pública superior al 100% del PIB, déficits persistentes y una creciente fragilidad institucional. El texto atribuye la situación belga a una estructura de gobierno multicapa y fragmentada, con luchas internas que dificultan la coordinación de políticas y la implementación de proyectos de infraestructuras y bienestar social. Además, señala la infiltración del crimen organizado en puertos clave como Amberes, así como en policía y poder judicial, lo que alimenta la economía sumergida y la violencia.

Estos vehículos se situarán entre los cuadriciclos pesados (L7e) y los turismos (M1) y tendrán menos restricciones en aspectos como la seguridad activa, lo que permitirá reducir los costos. Con un precio objetivo entre los 15.000 y 20.000 euros, se espera que la medida impulse la industria europea frente a la competencia china. Marcas como Citroën ya han mostrado interés en este tipo de vehículos, que podrían incluir modelos como el FIAT 600 o el Renault 4. Además, a pesar de que los coches de esta categoría serán predominantemente eléctricos, se baraja la posibilidad de incluir también modelos con otros combustibles, como el ministro italiano Adolfo Urso ha sugerido.

El caso comenzó cuando, el 7 de octubre, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, jefe de gabinete de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, adelantó a los medios una decisión judicial que no se había hecho pública aún. Este acto de filtración fue solo el principio de una serie de revelaciones, que incluyen la comunicación entre Isabel Perelló, presidenta del Tribunal Supremo, y García Ortiz.

Según CTEE, los precios contractuales de DRAM aumentaron un 171,8% interanual hasta el tercer trimestre de 2025, situándose por delante de las alzas recientes del oro. ADATA, citada en la noticia, señala que el cuarto trimestre de 2025 podría marcar el inicio de un gran ciclo alcista para la DRAM, con proyecciones de escasez en 2026. Los aumentos de precios también se han trasladado a memorias de gama alta para consumo, con DDR5 y componentes relacionados viendo incrementos significativos; por ejemplo, kits DDR5 de alto rendimiento han duplicado o triplicado su precio respecto a meses anteriores. Los fabricantes están priorizando memorias orientadas a centros de datos, reduciendo la producción de DDR5 para consumo.

À Punt avanza los planes de su nueva temporada con la idea de lanzar un programa de actualidad y política en horario de máxima audiencia, previsto para emitir los viernes por la noche. El favorito de la dirección para presentar esta propuesta es Toni Cantó, conocido actor y figura política con pasado en UPyD, Cs y Vox, que ya ha trabajado en la cadena autonómica y en otras plataformas de la región. Aunque Cantó sería la opción principal, la cadena no descarta otras candidaturas y ha contactado con otros nombres para liderar el formato. El proyecto, desarrollado por la productora valenciana El Garaje Audiovisual, se enmarca dentro de la estrategia de ampliar la oferta informativa y de actualidad de À Punt, complementando programas ya en parrilla como Va de bó y À Punt et busca.

La alerta ha sido activada en fase de riesgo de insuficiencia drenante, lo que significa que existe un peligro importante de acumulación de agua en las calles de la ciudad. Las autoridades recomiendan a la población extremar las precauciones, especialmente en zonas vulnerables a inundaciones. Se insta a evitar cruzar rieras, torrentes y pasos subterráneos. Además, se advierte de la prohibición de acceder a los espigones de las playas y de bañarse cuando ondee la bandera roja. En casa, se sugiere asegurar ventanas y tejados, retirar objetos que puedan ser arrastrados por el agua, y tener a mano elementos de emergencia como teléfonos y medicamentos.

En la pared cercana a la entrada de la cueva, se observa una estructura de red multilayer que alberga una colonia estimada en unas 69.000 Tegenaria domestica y 42.000 Prinerigone vagans. Este hallazgo podría ser el primer caso documentado de formación de telarañas coloniales en ambas especies, que normalmente son solitarias. El equipo, que incluyó miembros de la Czech Speleological Society, exploró cuevas sulfurosas en 2022 para estudiar la fauna subterránea. Para estimar el tamaño de la colonia, los investigadores contaron telarañas individuales en secciones al azar y extrapolaron la densidad, calculando una superficie de aproximadamente 106 metros cuadrados.

Los híbridos también tuvieron un peso significativo (20,3%), seguidos por los híbridos enchufables (18,3%). En contraposición, la gasolina y el diésel redujeron notablemente su presencia, con cuotas de 17,3% y 6,7% respectivamente. La comparación con España muestra que Portugal ha acelerado su transición, mientras en España la mayoría de las matriculaciones siguen estando dominadas por los híbridos HEV (41,4%), acompañados de gasolina (23,6%) y eléctricos (5,3%).

Esta iniciativa beneficiará tanto a propietarios como a inquilinos, incluso si no cuentan con paneles solares en sus viviendas. La idea es trasladar el consumo energético hacia las horas de mayor producción solar, como el uso de electrodomésticos o la carga de vehículos eléctricos, en lugar de las horas punta de la tarde, reduciendo así la presión sobre la red eléctrica y ayudando a bajar los costes.

El individuo, quien se encontraba en estado de embriaguez, intentó besarle el cuello y abrazarla por la espalda. Sheinbaum explicó que no se dio cuenta del suceso hasta que su equipo de seguridad apartó al hombre, quien fue detenido posteriormente. Durante una rueda de prensa, la mandataria expresó su condena rotunda al incidente, subrayando que esta es una vulneración del espacio personal de cualquier mujer, no solo de una figura pública como ella. Además, destacó que este tipo de violencia no debe ser tolerado y anunció una campaña nacional para promover el respeto hacia las mujeres y reforzar la lucha contra el acoso sexual. La presidenta recordó que, aunque este episodio ha sido muy mediático, no es el primero en su vida, ya que sufrió acoso a los 12 años en el transporte público.

Rajoy desempeñará el papel de mentor político de Torrente, asesorándole en su carrera dentro del ficticio partido Nox. Según las fuentes cercanas al rodaje, se prevé que el personaje de Rajoy tenga un lapsus que provocará la risa del público. Esta no es la primera vez que Rajoy y Santiago Segura se cruzan, ya que en 2005 ambos coincidieron en la presentación de 'Torrente 3: El protector', y desde entonces han mantenido una relación cordial. La saga de 'Torrente', conocida por sus cameos de personajes populares y figuras del entretenimiento, se sigue consolidando como un referente del cine español.

Según BILD y sus fuentes, la situación en el terreno es precaria: avances rusos podrían encerrar a unidades ucranianas, dificultando su retirada y debilitando la capacidad de respuesta. Mientras los canales oficiales insisten en que las áreas se mantienen y que la defensa se mantiene, las evaluaciones internas señalan riesgos de que la defensa podría desmoronarse si la presión continúa y la retirada ya no es viable. En este contexto, surge un debate político sobre la gestión de Zelenskiy, con críticas que señalan que un retiro estratégico temprano podría haber evitado pérdidas crecientes. A nivel internacional, el artículo sugiere que mantener una postura contundente podría ser clave para no perder cara ante aliados, especialmente en el marco de la relación]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/riesgo-de-cerco-en-donbas-y-criticas-a-zelenskiy-ante-posible-derrota-rusa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/riesgo-de-cerco-en-donbas-y-criticas-a-zelenskiy-ante-posible-derrota-rusa</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 21:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Soldados estadounidenses en Alemania deben acudir a bancos de alimentos locales ante cierre del gobierno de EE.

Feijóo afirmó que no debe haber miedo a Hacienda para los autónomos y que merece la pena emprender. Puente, a través de X, replicó con un dardo ácido: “Eso es posible, Alberto.

A través de un índice claro, se detalla por qué el pensamiento crítico funciona como una vacuna contra la desinformación y cuándo comenzar a enseñarlo, incluso desde los 4 o 5 años. Se presentan cinco estrategias prácticas para fomentar esta habilidad en casa: preguntar más y explicar menos, comparar fuentes y versiones, hablar sin miedo sobre errores y engaños, usar el humor como herramienta pedagógica y ser un modelo de pensamiento crítico. Además, se subraya la importancia de la colaboración entre escuelas, medios y familias para consolidar un enfoque coherente. En resumen, educar en pensamiento crítico no busca desconfiar de todo, sino dotar a los niños de herramientas para analizar, comparar y decidir de forma informada, promoviendo ciudadanos más libres y responsables.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-ensenar-pensamiento-critico-a-los-ninos-para-enfrentar-la-desinformacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-ensenar-pensamiento-critico-a-los-ninos-para-enfrentar-la-desinformacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 19:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ayuso critica la política de vivienda del Gobierno y propone un modelo de colaboración intergubernamental]]></title><description><![CDATA[Isabel Díaz Ayuso, presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, ha usado una comparecencia sobre su nuevo plan de vivienda para criticar al Gobierno central. A pesar de rechazar aplicar la ley estatal, Ayuso ha defendido que el problema de la vivienda solo se resolverá con la cooperación entre administraciones. Ha señalado que no se puede culpar a una única administración por la crisis y que las políticas del Ejecutivo central, como el exceso de burocracia, los impuestos y las ‘leyes sectarias’, generan inseguridad jurídica y desincentivan la propiedad. Según Ayuso, su modelo en Madrid, basado en la libertad, menos intervención y más oferta de vivienda, ha sido un éxito, a diferencia de otros lugares donde, según ella, la okupación se ha descontrolado. Entre las medidas propuestas está la creación de más viviendas protegidas y un plan denominado 'mi primera vivienda', que se ampliará a personas de hasta 50 años.

La desigualdad social se ha cronificado y el origen familiar condiciona mucho más que el mérito individual. La educación obligatoria ha dejado de ser suficiente para evitar la pobreza y la falta de estudios postobligatorios acentúa el riesgo.

Esta figura de bronce, que representa a un joven montando un caballo, fue descubierta en 1928 cerca del Cabo Artemisio, en la isla griega de Eubea. La escultura es única tanto por su calidad artística como por la representación dinámica del caballo y su jinete en plena carrera. El caballo, con sus patas levantadas y su cuerpo en un movimiento casi frenético, y el niño, agotado y suspendido sobre su montura, transmiten de forma vívida el dramatismo y la energía del momento. La estatua, que data de alrededor del 150 a.C., está considerada uno de los pocos ejemplos de escultura en bronce que han sobrevivido desde la antigüedad, ya que la mayoría de estas obras fueron fundidas a lo largo de los siglos. Actualmente se expone en el Museo Arqueológico Nacional de Atenas, y sigue siendo un símbolo de los ideales clásicos griegos, fusionando la perfección técnica con una profunda expresividad]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-jockey-de-artemisio-un-ejemplo-unico-de-escultura-griega-clasica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-jockey-de-artemisio-un-ejemplo-unico-de-escultura-griega-clasica</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 18:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teruel convoca jornadas de protesta contra la participación del Maccabi Tel Aviv en competiciones deportivas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Teruel acogerá una serie de jornadas de protesta del 8 al 12 de noviembre en rechazo a la participación del equipo israelí Maccabi Tel Aviv en la Challenge Cup de Voleibol. Las movilizaciones, impulsadas por la plataforma Teruel con Palestina y apoyadas por diversos colectivos aragoneses, buscan expresar la férrea repulsa de la ciudadanía turolense al genocidio que el Estado de Israel está cometiendo contra el pueblo palestino. Las organizaciones consideran que el equipo israelí debería haber sido excluido de la competición por sus vínculos con el sionismo y por el uso del deporte para normalizar un Estado que vulnera sistemáticamente los derechos humanos. El sábado 8 de noviembre se celebrará un acto de presentación en el Centro Social Autogestionado A Ixena, con ponencias de activistas palestinas y representantes de colectivos pro-Palestina. El domingo 9 tendrá lugar una manifestación en la Plaza del Torico, y durante los días 11 y 12 se realizarán concentraciones frente al Pabellón ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/teruel-convoca-jornadas-de-protesta-contra-la-participacion-del-maccabi-tel-aviv-en-competiciones-deportivas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/teruel-convoca-jornadas-de-protesta-contra-la-participacion-del-maccabi-tel-aviv-en-competiciones-deportivas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 17:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mazón firmó resoluciones urgentes de becas mientras estaba en El Ventorro durante la dana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Carlos Mazón, president de la Generalitat Valenciana, estaba localizable durante su comida en El Ventorro el día de la dana, según la versión oficial del gobierno autonómico.

Entre las características que faltan destacan la falta de autoconciencia, ya que muchos no perciben las molestias que causan a los demás; un déficit de empatía, pues no se ponen en el lugar del otro para evaluar si su acción es invasiva; y un escaso control de impulsos, priorizando la gratificación inmediata. Además, hay una baja conciencia social, que se traduce en no reconocer las normas implícitas de los espacios públicos. El respeto hacia los demás y la falta de conciencia situacional también son claves en este comportamiento, así como una deficiencia en la responsabilidad personal, ya que quienes son señalados por su conducta suelen reaccionar a la defensiva.

Marx describe cómo el tiempo que los obreros venden su fuerza de trabajo es clave para la generación de plusvalía y la acumulación de capital. A partir de estas dinámicas, surge el concepto de turismo como una consecuencia de la mercantilización del tiempo libre: no sería un derecho, sino un producto generado por la necesidad social de escapar, aunque las condiciones tecnológicas y organizativas que facilita el capitalismo hacen posible esta evasión. El autor sostiene que, lejos de liberar a las personas, el turismo puede convertirse en una forma de inmersión en el propio sistema productivo, transformando el ocio en un motor de consumo.

Tras una década de trabajo, el casco está a punto de salir al mar el 7 de noviembre, con la construcción final de mástiles, velas y herrajes. El proyecto, considerado uno de los ejemplos más ambiciosos de recuperación de oficios perdidos como la carpintería de ribera y la soguería, busca volver a poner en valor la historia marítima vasca y su expansión atlántica durante la Monarquía hispánica. Albaola ha recibido reconocimiento internacional, incluido el de Buenas Prácticas de la UNESCO. Paralelamente, la escritora Ane Odriozola presenta su novela histórica “Al subir la marea” en el marco del astillero, que explora la vida en torno al mundo naval del siglo XVI.

Diseñado para operar en entornos de vientos muy intensos y cercanos a tifones, con un diámetro de rotor entre 260 y 292 metros y una capacidad estimada de más de 80 GWh al año, el aparato estaba en fase de pruebas y no se había comercializado. Mingyang afirmó que el fallo ocurrió bajo condiciones anormales y extremas y que el sistema base continuó funcionando, aunque con palas dañadas. Este incidente subraya los desafíos técnicos de escalar turbinas de gran envergadura: materiales, carga aerodinámica, vibraciones y resistencia ante fenómenos extremos. La empresa ya está trabajando en una versión aún mayor, el MySE 22 MW. A pesar del contratiempo, se considera que estas pruebas críticas son necesarias para garantizar fiabilidad en futuras versiones y en la generación masiva de energía eólica marina.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mingyang-prototipo-de-20-mw-sufre-fracturas-en-pruebas-extremas-pese-a-su-diseno-para-condiciones-severas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mingyang-prototipo-de-20-mw-sufre-fracturas-en-pruebas-extremas-pese-a-su-diseno-para-condiciones-severas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 14:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hallan el cuerpo de un hombre de 60 años con mutilaciones graves en Lorenzana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una persona de unos 60 años, vecino de Lorenzana en Cuadros (León), fue encontrada sin vida en un pozo de la zona.

El cuerpo presentaría destrozos internos, evisceración y signos de violencia severa. Los primeros indicios apuntan a la posibilidad de que el hecho pueda responder a algún tipo de ritual, aunque la benemérita mantiene la hipótesis de una venganza violenta.

Siete personas han sido detenidas como presuntas autoras de delitos contra la flora y fauna y de tenencia ilícita de explosivos. La operación, denominada 'Encaixe', comenzó en abril tras sospechas sobre el uso de métodos prohibidos por una embarcación profesional. Los detenidos almacenaban cartuchos y detonadores en garajes y puertos, trasladándolos de forma clandestina y ocultándolos cerca de la embarcación antes de cada salida. Durante la investigación, agentes grabaron las detonaciones submarinas mediante hidrófonos, gracias a la colaboración de la Universidad de Vigo. Se han documentado incidentes con submarinistas deportivos, que sufrieron ondas de presión y angustia tras una explosión cerca de la ensenada del Ézaro.

Según el testigo, en ese momento, los bomberos forestales informaron de que el nivel del agua había descendido significativamente, y tras realizar las mediciones necesarias, se les indicó que regresaran a la base de Yátova, quedando a la espera de nuevos requerimientos.

Aunque no detalló cómo se llevaría a cabo esta propuesta ni el alcance del gravamen, su mensaje responde a la creciente migración de neoyorquinos a Texas, un estado que, según el Censo de 2024, ha visto un flujo migratorio significativo. En 2023, más de 600,000 personas se mudaron a Texas, en gran parte provenientes de estados como Nueva York, California y Florida.

Este experimento tenía como objetivo evaluar el sistema Distributed Power (DP), que permite coordinar remotamente múltiples locomotoras situadas a lo largo del tren, controladas desde una unidad maestra. El fin no era comercial sino tecnológico: demostrar que un solo maquinista puede gestionar unidades dispersas mediante comunicación electrónica y un sistema de freno neumático controlado electrónicamente (ECP brakes).

El reportaje centra su atención en casos como el de Shirley Chung, adoptada en 1966 en Texas, que al perder la ciudadanía y enfrentarse al riesgo de expulsión se enfrenta a una identidad que no coincide con su vida cotidiana. A lo largo del artículo se destacan testimonios de adoptados y familias que denuncian fallos sistémicos en documentación y procedimientos migratorios, así como la ausencia de información clara proporcionada por escuelas y autoridades. Se estima que entre 18.000 y 75.000 personas adoptadas podrían no tener ciudadanía, un vacío que ha llevado a deportaciones y situaciones de apátrida. La Ley de Ciudadanía Infantil de 2000 buscó corregir estas lagunas, otorgando ciudadanía automática a adoptados internacionales nacidos a partir de 1983; sin embargo, quienes llegaron antes quedaron ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adoptados-internacionales-en-ee-uu-miedo-a-la-deportacion-y-vacios-legales-de-ciudadania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adoptados-internacionales-en-ee-uu-miedo-a-la-deportacion-y-vacios-legales-de-ciudadania</guid><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 10:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El poder militar de EE.UU. como extensión del capitalismo global: una crítica a sus intervenciones]]></title><description><![CDATA[En las últimas décadas, Estados Unidos ha utilizado su poder militar para mantener su hegemonía global, adoptando la guerra como una extensión de su modelo económico capitalista. Bajo pretextos como la defensa de la democracia y la lucha contra el terrorismo, ha intervenido en países como Venezuela, Libia, Irak, Siria y Nigeria, con el fin de asegurar el control sobre recursos naturales estratégicos como petróleo, gas y minerales. La retórica de la libertad y los derechos humanos que acompaña a estas intervenciones encubre, en muchos casos, el saqueo de estos recursos y la expansión de los intereses económicos de grandes corporaciones estadounidenses. Este modelo imperial se ha convertido en una constante, con resultados desastrosos para los países invadidos, que han visto cómo sus economías y sociedades se destruyen mientras las élites financieras de EE.UU. se benefician.

Su ascenso político ha sido meteórico, pasando de ser un casi desconocido asambleísta a derrotar a figuras como el exgobernador Andrew Cuomo y el candidato republicano Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, conocido por su postura progresista, impulsó una plataforma centrada en la asequibilidad de la vivienda, la educación universal y políticas a favor de los trabajadores. Su victoria ha causado una gran división, con fuertes apoyos entre los votantes jóvenes y de izquierda, pero también una notable oposición de sectores más conservadores y moderados. Además, su activismo pro-palestino y su fe musulmana fueron temas polémicos durante la campaña.

Además, el flujo de caja libre proyectado para 2025 es un 20% inferior al consenso de los analistas, lo que ha incrementado las dudas sobre su futuro. Telefónica ha recortado su dividendo a la mitad para 2026, una medida que refleja la necesidad de ajustar su política financiera debido a una deuda considerable. Los expertos apuntan que la teleco está intentando consolidar su posición en el sector a través de fusiones y adquisiciones, aunque no hay detalles claros sobre este enfoque.

El hallazgo es el resultado del proyecto Phoenix Mediterranea, promovido por la Universidad de Cádiz y la Diputación Provincial. Este descubrimiento proporciona una nueva perspectiva sobre la historia de la antigua ciudad fenicia, que jugaba un papel clave en el poblamiento de la bahía gaditana. La puerta, ubicada en el muro occidental del asentamiento, presenta una estructura en ángulo que parece influenciada por modelos helenísticos. Además, se han encontrado otros vestigios arqueológicos, como una catapulta y una vasija de almacenamiento, que ayudan a comprender mejor la vida cotidiana en el lugar.

A pesar de firmar una carta conjunta para sostener la prohibición, el contexto en España muestra un progreso eléctrico limitado: en 2025, solo el 8% de las matriculaciones son 100% eléctricas, muy por debajo de países líderes como Noruega, Dinamarca o Suecia, y situando a España como uno de los países con mayor dependencia de motores térmicos en la Unión Europea. Este desfase tiene profundas implicaciones para la industria automotriz española, que es uno de los mayores productores de Europa, con una parte significativa de su tejido industrial vinculada a la fabricación de motores de combustión y a las cadenas logísticas asociadas.

El informe revela que Torres mostró interés por los impagos a la empresa Soluciones de Gestión, pero no detecta evidencia de que él ordenara la contratación de la empresa ni que recibiera comisiones. Además, se señala que el ministro de Política Territorial se mostró ajeno al entramado y, en algunos mensajes de WhatsApp, incluso desconocía detalles básicos sobre la empresa y la deuda.

A través de un cambio progresivo de la distancia focal, de lentes de 28 mm a longitudes mayores (hasta 75 mm), el director Sidney Lumet comprime visualmente el espacio de la sala de deliberación. A medida que los argumentos se vuelven más intensos, el encuadre se “aplana” y las paredes parecen acercarse, generando una sensación tangible de claustrofobia en el espectador. Este procedimiento no cambia el tamaño real del set, sino la percepción, y funciona junto al ritmo narrativo: la deliberación pasa de ser un trámite a un forcejeo moral acentuado. Además, la película está rodada casi sin música, lo que potencia aún más la respiración, las miradas y las sutilezas del juego de poder entre los personajes. Lumet explicó más tarde que la cámara debía ser un elemento emocional, no neutro.

Esta declaración contradice un fallo judicial reciente que ordenaba el pago parcial de estos beneficios. Según Trump, los pagos se reanudarían solo cuando los demócratas en el Congreso aprueben una medida para reabrir el gobierno. El conflicto afecta a aproximadamente 42 millones de estadounidenses que dependen de estos beneficios para su alimentación. Los abogados de los demandantes señalan que la decisión del gobierno de otorgar solo pagos parciales es arbitraria y perjudica a las familias más vulnerables. El cierre del gobierno comenzó el 1 de octubre y, a diferencia de administraciones anteriores, la actual administración de Trump ha optado por no utilizar fondos de contingencia para continuar con los pagos del SNAP. La situación ha provocado diversas demandas en tribunales federales y generado fuertes ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-pone-en-riesgo-los-beneficios-snap-mientras-persiste-el-cierre-del-gobierno</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-pone-en-riesgo-los-beneficios-snap-mientras-persiste-el-cierre-del-gobierno</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 23:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dolores Ruiz denuncia la inacción de Mazón durante la tragedia de la DANA que arrastró a su familia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El testimonio de Dolores Ruiz, que perdió a su marido y a dos de sus hijos en la catástrofe provocada por la DANA de octubre de 2024, ha conmocionado al Congreso de los Diputados. Dolores, quien sobrevivió sujetándose a una reja, ha explicado cómo la tragedia se desató cuando su familia no fue advertida a tiempo del riesgo de inundaciones. A pesar de que el río Poyo ya estaba desbordado, el presidente de la Generalitat, Carlos Mazón, se encontraba comiendo tranquilamente en El Ventorro sin tomar medidas urgentes. Dolores ha criticado duramente su inacción, argumentando que si las alertas se hubieran emitido correctamente, su familia podría haber sobrevivido. La mujer, que ahora vive desolada y lejos de su hogar en Chiva, ha pedido justicia para su familia y ha manifestado que no descansará hasta que se asuman responsabilidades.

El total de cotizantes alcanza 21,8 millones, con un crecimiento interanual del 2,38%, el más alto desde enero. Aunque la temporada estival terminó, la hostelería perdió 50.594 empleos y el sector sanitario 34.341, entre otros. Esta destrucción quedó compensada por incrementos importantes en educación (167.329 contrataciones), profesiones técnico-científicas e información y comunicaciones (≈15.000), construcción (≈15.300) y actividades artísticas y de entretenimiento (≈16.700). La industria también mostró un ligero crecimiento de 3.865 trabajadores. Excluido el componente estacional, el incremento fue de algo más de 64.500 personas. El paro registrado aumentó en 22.101 personas, situándose en 2,4 millones, con un aumento más moderado que en otros años.

Las imágenes, que se difundieron rápidamente, muestran al político vapeando de forma discreta y relajada justo detrás de la ministra, impulsora del nuevo anteproyecto de ley antitabaco que restringe el uso de cigarrillos electrónicos. La escena, cargada de simbolismo e ironía política, provocó una amplia reacción pública. Mónica García calificó el incidente de 'insólito' y afirmó con tono crítico e irónico que el Senado del PP parecía una 'barra brava vikinga'. Tras la polémica, Arenas se defendió alegando que no estaba fumando, sino que simplemente se llevó el vaper a la boca por costumbre, negando haber inhalado o exhalado vapor. El momento coincide con la aprobación por parte del Gobierno del anteproyecto de la nueva ley antitabaco, que equipara los vapeadores con los cigarrillos tradic]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-arenas-genera-polemica-por-usar-un-cigarrillo-electronico-en-el-senado-durante-la-intervencion-de-la-ministra-de-sanidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-arenas-genera-polemica-por-usar-un-cigarrillo-electronico-en-el-senado-durante-la-intervencion-de-la-ministra-de-sanidad</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 22:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[PACMA exige endurecer las penas por maltrato animal tras hallazgo de 52 perros hacinados y seis muertos en Arganda]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia informa sobre la denuncia del Partido Animalista PACMA tras un suceso ocurrido en Arganda del Rey, donde la Guardia Civil rescató a 52 perros que vivían en condiciones insalubres y halló seis cadáveres en el interior de una vivienda. PACMA argumenta que la legislación actual no garantiza una protección suficiente para los animales y propone reformas urgentes del Código Penal para endurecer las penas por maltrato animal, llegando a exigir hasta 10 años de prisión y la inhabilitación permanente para la tenencia y el trabajo con animales. El informe señala que la situación, adelantada por Diario de Arganda, ha reavivado el debate sobre la eficacia de las leyes vigentes, que a menudo se traducen en sanciones administrativas o penas menores que no cumplen una función disuasoria. El caso ocurrió el 13 de octubre, cuando la Guardia Civil descubrió un local con numerosos animales sin condiciones mínimas de habitabilidad, rodeados de excrementos y falta de acceso a suministros básico]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pacma-exige-endurecer-las-penas-por-maltrato-animal-tras-hallazgo-de-52-perros-hacinados-y-seis-muertos-en-arganda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pacma-exige-endurecer-las-penas-por-maltrato-animal-tras-hallazgo-de-52-perros-hacinados-y-seis-muertos-en-arganda</guid><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 22:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El empresario Alberto González Amador declaró que quiso resolver su caso fiscal sin perjudicar a Ayuso]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alberto González Amador, empresario y pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, declaró ante el Tribunal Supremo que su intención fue resolver cuanto antes y con la máxima discreción el proceso judicial que enfrenta por presunto fraude fiscal. Según explicó, pensó desde el principio que la inspección de Hacienda que derivó en la causa contra él se debió a su relación con la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid. Afirmó ante los magistrados que tuvo la intuición de que los inspectores conocían su identidad y que pidió a sus abogados una resolución rápida, “sin ruido”, para evitar que el procedimiento afectara la imagen pública de Ayuso.

El caso contra González Amador se inició por una investigación de Hacienda relacionada con posibles irregularidades en sus declaraciones fiscales. Durante su comparecencia, insistió en que no hubo intención de defraudar y que su única preocupación era que la repercusión mediática salpicara a la presidenta madrileña.

La Intervención municipal ha confirmado el incumplimiento de la obligación de justificar estos gastos, lo que genera serias dudas sobre la transparencia de la gestión de los fondos públicos. Ante esta situación, el PSOE ha exigido una investigación exhaustiva sobre las cuentas de Vox en las Cortes de Castilla-La Mancha y una revisión de las subvenciones concedidas al partido en los últimos años.

En el desierto de Gobi, el Instituto de Física Aplicada de Shanghái ha demostrado con éxito la conversión de torio en uranio dentro de un reactor experimental de sales fundidas, una tecnología abandonada por Estados Unidos en la década de 1960. Esta innovadora técnica no solo ofrece una fuente de energía más segura y sostenible, sino que también resuelve algunos de los problemas más graves de los reactores nucleares tradicionales, como la generación de residuos radiactivos a largo plazo. A diferencia de los reactores de uranio convencionales, el reactor de torio funciona a presión atmosférica y su diseño permite una mayor eficiencia en la conversión del combustible, aprovechando más del 99% de su energía. Además, la tecnología tiene un sistema de seguridad pasiva que elimina el riesgo de explosiones, como las que ocurrieron en Chernóbil.

El juicio se centra en un correo electrónico que Rodríguez recibió en marzo de 2024 de parte de González Amador, en el que se mencionaba la posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo con la Fiscalía por un supuesto fraude fiscal. Rodríguez reconoció que utilizó ese correo para desmentir una noticia de La Sexta y, en consecuencia, contribuir a difundir el bulo sobre un supuesto acuerdo con la Fiscalía. A lo largo de su declaración, Rodríguez defendió que actuó en defensa de la reputación de la presidenta Ayuso, ya que el novio de ésta deseaba evitar la litigiosidad con Hacienda para proteger su imagen.

La norma, que ya pasó su primer trámite en el Parlament, ha sido impulsada por el Govern y los partidos ERC, Comuns y CUP, con el objetivo de limitar los precios de los alquileres temporales. La ley establece que los alquileres por motivos profesionales o de estudios, entre otros, se regirán por las mismas reglas que los arrendamientos de vivienda habitual. Sin embargo, Junts y PP argumentan que el procedimiento legislativo ha sido acelerado y ha excluido la posibilidad de enmiendas por parte de otros grupos. Además, critican que la ley tiene efectos retroactivos y podría generar inseguridad jurídica para propietarios y arrendatarios.

Jerome Powell, presidente de la Reserva Federal, ha advertido sobre el debilitamiento del mercado laboral, destacando que la creación de empleo está cerca de cero. A pesar de un desempleo del 4,3%, muchas empresas están despidiendo personal, y Amazon, por ejemplo, planea recortar 14.000 empleos globalmente. Este fenómeno ha provocado un aumento de la desigualdad social, con grandes corporaciones y personas con altos ingresos beneficiándose, mientras que los trabajadores de bajos ingresos se ven más empobrecidos.

La víctima, quien logró presentar un informe médico que documentó las agresiones, denunció los hechos el pasado 7 de octubre, lo que llevó a la detención del agresor.
