The rollout, set for March, has already sparked backlash from users concerned about privacy and data security. Some UK users are now part of a test using Persona, an age verification vendor whose lead investor is Founders Fund, co-founded by Peter Thiel. Thiel is also known for co-founding Palantir, a surveillance technology firm, and his controversial history in the tech and finance world. Discord states that data submitted to Persona will only be temporarily stored for up to seven days before deletion. While the company insists this measure is limited to certain users and is intended to improve age detection, critics remain wary due to Thiel's involvement and the sensitive nature of the information being collected. The Electronic Frontier Foundation and other privacy advocates have expressed concern over potential mis]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discord-trials-age-verification-with-persona-raising-privacy-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discord-trials-age-verification-with-persona-raising-privacy-concerns</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 02:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Systemic Abuses and Human Rights Violations in U.S. ICE Detention Centers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article exposes systemic human rights abuses across multiple ICE detention centers in the United States, highlighting inhumane conditions, medical neglect, and torture-like treatment. Facilities such as the Everglades Detention Facility, Chicago’s Broadview ICE facility, Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Center, and the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley are described as overcrowded, unsanitary, and abusive. Reports include shackling in extreme heat, denial of medical care, beatings, punitive isolation, and mistreatment of children. Documented deaths and mistreatment, such as José Manuel Sánchez-Castro, Paraday La, Geraldo Lunas Campos, and Víctor Manuel Díaz, raise concerns over medical neglect and cover-ups. The article situates these abuses within a historical context of U.S. systemic violence, from the genocide of Indigenous peoples to Guantánamo Bay and overseas interventions, arguing that ICE detention practices are a continuation of institutionalized torture and]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/systemic-abuses-and-human-rights-violations-in-u-s-ice-detention-centers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/systemic-abuses-and-human-rights-violations-in-u-s-ice-detention-centers</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 00:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Opium War Still Controls China’s Foreign Policy]]></title><description><![CDATA[The video argues that the legacy of the Opium War continues to significantly shape China's foreign policy decisions, influencing its stance on sovereignty, national humiliation narratives, and its interactions with Western powers.

The case has since become a symbol of racist migration policies in Belgium. Journalist and filmmaker Marta Bergman created the fiction film “L’enfant bélier” (The Ram Girl) inspired by this crime. However, the film has been criticized for depoliticizing the case, omitting political responsibility, and removing the solidarity efforts of the public, presenting instead a purely psychological narrative focused on the emotional struggle of the police officer who fired the fatal shot. In reality, the media and authorities initially misrepresented the incident, spreading false narratives that criminalized the victims and invented the legend of the “ram girl.” The prosecution falsely claimed the death could have been caused by an illness or an accidental injury, while in reality, the child died from a traumatic head injury during the police altercation.

Nick Reyes opens with a cautionary tale about booking a nonrefundable cash flight just days before departure. When his son fell ill shortly afterward, the family had to cancel. Fortunately, trip cancellation protections from a credit card are expected to cover the loss, underscoring the importance of built-in travel insurance benefits when flexibility is limited.

The blog also details ongoing issues with the Bilt 2.0 rollout. Some cardholders have reported frozen accounts shortly after approval and problems receiving a limited-time 5x promotional offer. In several cases, Bilt’s initial customer service responses were viewed as inadequate, though the company later indicated it would review certain cases individually.

Rather than choosing the rational option of taking 15,000 TrueBlue points each as their Mosaic “Perks You Pick” benefit—a combined total of 60,000 points—Reyes opted for a riskier strategy. He and his family selected 20-tile bonuses, with his wife and children gifting their tiles to him in hopes of pushing him close to Mosaic 2 status.

His motivation extended beyond immediate perks like EvenMore Space seating. He speculated about a potential future merger between JetBlue and United Airlines, wondering whether Mosaic status might someday map to United’s MileagePlus elite tiers. Although he acknowledges this is pure speculation, he believed achieving Mosaic 2 could potentially translate into more valuable United status if a merger were to occur.

The posts often use memes, AI-generated art, patriotic slogans, and cinematic language, but some contain phrases, symbols, and imagery with direct ties to neo-Nazi and white nationalist movements. Notable examples include phrases lifted from William Gayley Simpson’s antisemitic book 'Which Way Western Man?' and songs used in white nationalist circles, such as 'We’ll Have Our Home Again' by the Pine Tree Riots. Other posts mimic slogans closely associated with Hitler, like the Department of Labor’s caption “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage.” Scholars and propaganda experts note that these posts subtly normalize extremist rhetoric, appealing to emotions, simplifying ideas, and using dog whistles that are recognizable only to specific audiences. Critics argue that wh]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/government-social-media-posts-resemble-historical-nazi-propaganda-experts-warn</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/government-social-media-posts-resemble-historical-nazi-propaganda-experts-warn</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 19:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cardi B Falls Off Stage Chair and Jokes About Government After Incident]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cardi B had an unexpected fall during the opening night of her 'Little Miss Drama Tour.' While attempting a dramatic move, she slipped off her chair but immediately recovered with humor, claiming 'That wasn’t me, that was the government.' This lighthearted comment followed recent criticisms of the government by the rapper regarding immigration policies. Cardi B also engaged directly with her audience, discussing issues related to ICE and voicing her support for immigrant rights. Her remarks, which included a bold statement warning about ICE officials, sparked both attention and controversy. Some Homeland Security officials reportedly took issue with her comments, recalling a past controversy involving Cardi's criminal history. Despite the mix of humor and political remarks, the fall and her response turned her concert into a memorable event.

However, this support is now eroding, particularly among younger generations. Surveys indicate that U.S. Republicans under 50 have shifted from a predominantly positive view of Israel in 2022 to a negative majority by 2025. Young evangelicals also show a steep decline in support, with backing for Israel dropping from 69% in 2018 to 33.6% in 2021. This shift predates the recent Gaza conflict and reflects a broader generational change. Influential figures such as Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Steve Bannon have openly criticized Israeli policies. Additionally, changes in evangelical theology—from dispensationalism, which emphasized Israel as the 'promised land,' to supersessionism, which frames Christians as the new chosen people—have contributed to the decline.

Maher argued that much of the outrage from Republican commentators and supporters was exaggerated and inconsistent. He joked that conservative critics were still “butt-hurt” over the show and suggested their complaints had shifted over time. According to Maher, some initially criticized the performance for being in Spanish, while others later claimed their objections were about its sexual content and explicit lyrics.

Maher mocked former President Donald Trump’s remarks about not understanding the lyrics, comparing the experience to listening to Mick Jagger, whose words he said he also often could not understand but still enjoyed. Although Maher admitted he did not understand the Spanish-language performance either, he said that did not prevent him from appreciating the show’s energy and spectacle.

The ban, enforced under anti-terrorism laws, was deemed disproportionate and unlawful. The group, which has protested against Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems, was accused of causing financial damage to the company. Since the proscription, over 2,500 people have been detained for supporting the group, and while police will stop arrests for displaying support, the legal limbo remains for those charged under the terrorism act. Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action, hailed the ruling as a victory for freedom of expression and direct action. The government intends to appeal, with critics highlighting that the proscription was politically motivated, intended to appease pro-Israel groups.

According to a summit attendee, participants privately criticized President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to restart operations in Venezuela, citing logistical and security risks despite the US military’s recent capture of President Nicolas Maduro. Industry consultant Bob McNally highlighted Iran as a potential market with high rewards but significant risks, describing it as an opportunity for the US, the oil industry, and global stability. Meanwhile, the private discussions revealed hesitancy among oil executives about immediate reinvestment in Venezuela, due to guerrilla threats, unstable infrastructure, and possible conflicts with international partners. The summit also demonstrated the oil lobby's influence in media, as API sponsored the Paramount+ series 'Landman,' portraying the industry positively.

Epstein, despite having no verifiable credentials, was given broad power of attorney over Wexner's fortune in 1991, allowing him to control billions in assets, including Manhattan real estate. Over the years, Epstein used Wexner’s wealth, influence, and properties, including the 9 East 71st Street mansion, to facilitate sexual abuse and trafficking of young women. Multiple women, such as Maria Farmer and Alicia Arden, reported assaults linked to Epstein, yet authorities did not act effectively at the time. Epstein also financially supported Jean-Luc Brunel’s modeling agency, which allegedly supplied underage girls to him. Even after Wexner severed ties with Epstein in 2007, Victoria's Secret continued working with Epstein-funded agencies until 2015.

The complaint alleges that the National Security Agency did not properly distribute an intelligence report about a phone call between foreign officials discussing Iran, in which Kushner was referenced. Instead of sharing the report widely within the intelligence community, the complaint claims Gabbard presented it only to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and directed the NSA to provide further details exclusively to her office. The participants of the call reportedly indicated Kushner as a key contact to influence Middle East peace talks. While the whistleblower viewed this as significant, some intelligence officials described it as mere gossip.

Seeking a creative tribute to the vibrant flowers native to their region, the duo froze freshly picked blooms inside solid blocks of ice and photographed them at dawn. The project, titled “Zero Degrees,” captures flowers suspended in time, preserving their vivid colors and delicate forms within crystal-clear ice.

The process was far from simple. Working in early morning light to achieve the desired atmosphere, Boyd and Smith faced technical challenges including unwanted air bubbles forming inside the ice and inconsistent lighting conditions. These obstacles required patience and precision, as the artists carefully controlled freezing methods and timing to maintain clarity while preventing imperfections from distracting from the composition.

The proposal, introduced by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in December 2025, would require applicants under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) program to provide five years of social media information, along with additional personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, previous residences, and close family members’ details. ESTA applies to citizens from 42 countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and many European nations.

The term “incel,” originally coined in the 1990s as a gender-inclusive support label meaning “involuntary celibate,” has since evolved into a label associated with male-dominated online spaces that often promote misogynistic and extremist views. In the featured videos, content creator Kylie Brewer reveals posts from a large incel forum, describing widespread use of dehumanizing language toward women, racist rhetoric, and discussions that normalize hostility and, in some cases, violence.

The article explains that although some incel-related groups have been banned from mainstream platforms like Reddit, independent forums continue to operate. These spaces often revolve around a shared ideology known as the “blackpill,” which frames dating and social hierarchies as biologically predetermined and unchangeable.

After a brief chase, the 47-year-old captain, Zheng Nianli, was detained for refusing an onboard inspection. The vessel was seized, indicating Japan considered the infraction serious. While details on any illegal catch are not yet disclosed, the incident marks Japan's first detention of a Chinese fishing vessel in four years. The event occurs amid escalating tensions between Japan and China over Taiwan. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had suggested potential military intervention if China attacked Taiwan, prompting Chinese economic retaliations, including flight cancellations, restrictions on seafood trade, and limits on rare earth exports critical to Japanese industries. These tensions are further complicated by increased U.S. military support for Taiwan, including a record $11.1 billion arms sale in December.

These statements were reported and highlighted by Media Matters, a progressive watchdog organization that monitors extremist rhetoric and disinformation. The comments have been widely condemned for promoting misogyny and echoing extremist ideologies reminiscent of fascist regimes.

Civil defence teams reported over 2,800 cases where individuals essentially vanished, leaving only minimal traces such as blood or body fragments. Experts note that exposure to extreme temperatures, exceeding 3,500 degrees Celsius, can cause human bodies to vaporize due to their high water content. The investigation highlighted several specific munitions, including the MK-84 “Hammer,” BLU-109 bunker buster, and GBU-39 small diameter bomb, some of which were used in attacks on previously designated “safe zones” and civilian sites like schools.

Becca Balint Confronts Attorney General Pam Bondi Over Antisemitism Remarks During House Hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[During a House hearing that largely focused on questions surrounding the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation and related files, Representative Becca Balint (D-Vt.) sharply criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi over remarks concerning antisemitism legislation. The exchange occurred after lawmakers pressed Bondi on several issues, including redactions in the Epstein files and broader accountability within the department.

Tensions escalated when Bondi commented that she did not support a particular legislative measure aimed at combating antisemitism. Rep. Balint took strong exception to those comments, directly confronting the attorney general during her testimony. In an emotional moment, Balint referenced her personal family history, stating that her grandfather was killed in the Holocaust. She argued that dismissing or failing to support efforts to address antisemitism carries deep moral and historical implications.

The mission launched at 03:00 UTC from the newly inaugurated LC-301 launch pad at the Wenchang Space Launch Center, using a modified version of the Long March CZ-10A rocket without a second stage. The primary objective was to validate the spacecraft’s launch escape system under maximum dynamic pressure (Max-Q), one of the most critical phases of ascent.

Approximately 65 seconds after liftoff, at Max-Q, the solid-fueled escape tower ignited its four main motors, pulling the capsule safely away from the rocket while the first stage continued its ascent. Attitude control motors reoriented the vehicle before the tower separated. The capsule then deployed pilot and main parachutes and performed a controlled splashdown off the coast of Hainan Island. Recovery teams retrieved it shortly afterward. This marked the second test of the Mengzhou escape sy]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-successfully-tests-mengzhou-in-flight-abort-system-and-demonstrates-controlled-splashdown-of-cz-10a-first-stage</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-successfully-tests-mengzhou-in-flight-abort-system-and-demonstrates-controlled-splashdown-of-cz-10a-first-stage</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 00:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[United States Plans Second Aircraft Carrier Deployment to the Gulf Amid Ongoing Nuclear Talks with Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[The United States is reportedly preparing to increase its military presence in the Gulf region by deploying a second aircraft carrier near Iran, according to the article. The USS Gerald R. Ford, currently operating in the Caribbean, is expected to join the USS Abraham Lincoln, which has been stationed in the region since January along with its escort ships. The deployment would mark the first time in nearly a year that two U.S. aircraft carriers operate simultaneously in the Middle East.

Former President Donald Trump had recently mentioned the possibility of additional military measures in an interview with Israeli outlet News 12, stating that either an agreement would be reached with Iran or the United States would take “very tough” action. At the same time, he suggested that Tehran was interested in negotiating. The article describes the selection of the Gerald R.

According to reports, the musician posted an image that seemed to depict him driving at 123 miles per hour, based on a blurred speedometer visible behind the steering wheel. The post quickly drew attention online and raised concerns among those close to him. Shortly afterward, he shared a black-and-white selfie in which he appeared to be smoking what looked like a hand-rolled cigarette or joint, adding to the unease surrounding his recent actions.

The situation comes amid a reportedly difficult period for the former couple, who share a young daughter, Saga Blade, born in March 2025. Fox and Machine Gun Kelly allegedly split after she discovered he had been messaging other women during her pregnancy. Since their breakup, they have remained connected through co-parenting responsibilities.

Rather than working directly with a single moving company, a broker connects clients with a network of licensed and vetted carriers, each authorized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. This network allows brokers to match clients with movers who specialize in fragile items, climate-controlled transport, or custom crating, ensuring that high-value possessions receive appropriate care.

One of the key benefits highlighted is transparent pricing. Brokers provide detailed, upfront estimates that outline potential additional charges, such as fees for stairs, long carrying distances, or weekend deliveries. Because multiple carriers compete for the job, clients can compare clear quotes and avoid unexpected costs on moving day.

Speaking on a recent episode of the podcast “Inside Trump’s Head” with co-host Hugh Dougherty, executive editor of The Daily Beast, Wolff described the couple’s relationship as “remote at best.” He alleged that Melania Trump spends most of her time at Mar-a-Lago in Florida and at Trump properties in New York rather than residing full-time with the president.

Wolff, known for his critical coverage of Trump, has written four books examining Trump’s political career and personal life, including the widely discussed 2018 book “Fire and Fury.” His latest remarks come amid an ongoing legal battle with Melania Trump, who has filed a lawsuit seeking more than $1 billion in damages over claims that she had ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Experts warn that such AI-enabled surveillance networks, while helpful for locating pets or investigating crimes, can potentially be misused by authorities for broader surveillance, including monitoring individuals' political or social activities.

Estimates range widely from 300,000 to as many as 2 million individuals, though most scholars place the figure between 500,000 and 1 million. Strikingly, 40 to 60 percent of those affected were American citizens, many of them children born in the United States.

Although the federal government supported deportation efforts, much of the initiative came from state and local authorities, often working with private organizations. Formal deportations accounted for at least 82,000 removals, primarily between 1930 and 1933, but voluntary departures—often carried out under pressure or fear—far outnumbered official expulsions. Many families left in hopes of escaping economic hardship, while others were directly targeted in raids that swept through Mexican American neighborhoods, especially in ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-mexican-repatriation-during-the-great-depression-mass-deportations-and-civil-rights-violations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-mexican-repatriation-during-the-great-depression-mass-deportations-and-civil-rights-violations</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 18:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spain’s Prime Minister Pushes for Stricter Social Media Regulations Amid Personal Attacks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is spearheading legislation aimed at curbing the influence of social media platforms, motivated in part by personal experiences of online abuse.

The piece further suggests that King Charles has attempted to distance the monarchy from Prince Andrew in order to protect the institution’s reputation.

This move is part of a broader strategy by Moscow to encourage citizens to adopt local platforms, particularly Max, a VK-developed application integrating administrative, e-commerce, and communication services. Unlike WhatsApp, Max does not offer end-to-end encryption, raising privacy concerns.

In a video shared on social media, she expressed frustration with fellow conservatives, arguing that party loyalty should not prevent voters from condemning alleged wrongdoing. Identifying herself as a Trump voter with strong conservative values, she asked how supporters could continue backing the former president given claims about the frequency of his name appearing in the Epstein-related files.

Morgan Reserve® cardholders the chance to purchase up to forty World Cup tickets. However, due to overwhelming demand and technical difficulties, most cardholders were unable to secure any tickets. The process required multiple steps, including clicking a promotional link, waiting in a queue, and accessing FIFA's website, which frequently failed due to traffic. As a gesture of goodwill, Chase has reportedly provided 5,000 Ultimate Rewards points to cardholders who expressed frustration about the process. The points were credited after cardholders contacted Chase customer service and explained their issues. Multiple reports suggest this has been a consistent practice for those who complained, though it is unclear whether Chase verifies actual participation in the ticket queue. While this measure does not replace the chance to attend the World Cup, it demonstrates Chase's ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/chase-awards-5-000-points-to-cardholders-frustrated-by-world-cup-ticket-sale</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/chase-awards-5-000-points-to-cardholders-frustrated-by-world-cup-ticket-sale</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 12:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Will Smith Faces Sexual Harassment Lawsuit Amid Ongoing Career Comeback Efforts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Actor Will Smith is facing renewed controversy after a former member of his tour team filed a lawsuit accusing him of sexual harassment, wrongful termination, and retaliation. The complaint was brought by Brian King Joseph, a violinist who previously toured with Smith and appeared on 'America’s Got Talent.' Joseph is seeking $3 million in damages, alleging that he experienced inappropriate behavior and was later dismissed after reporting the incident to Smith’s management company. According to the lawsuit, he was allegedly shamed and ultimately fired in retaliation for speaking out.

Smith’s legal representative, Allen B. Grodsky, has firmly denied the allegations, describing them as false and reckless. Despite the denial, sources cited by Radar Online claim the accusations have deeply affected the actor, who reportedly believes the claims will not stand but feels shaken by the situation.

The launch took place from the ELA4 pad at the Guiana Space Centre and marked the sixth flight of the Ariane 6 series, following five previous missions with the A62 configuration, which had only two boosters. The mission, designated VA267 by Arianespace and Leo LE-01 by the client Amazon, successfully deployed 32 satellites for the Amazon Leo megaconstellation, formerly known as Kuiper. This launch also used the Ariane 6's long fairing (20 meters) for the first time, allowing for larger payloads. With four P120C boosters producing 3500 kN each, the A64 can place up to 21.6 tons into low Earth orbit (LEO) and 11 tons into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), nearly doubling the payload of the A62 variant. This makes Ariane 6 competitive with other heavy-lift rockets like Russia's Angará A5, China's CZ-5B, and the U.S.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-successfully-launches-ariane-6-a64-rocket-carrying-32-amazon-leo-satellites</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-successfully-launches-ariane-6-a64-rocket-carrying-32-amazon-leo-satellites</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 11:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former Bracknell Mayor Convicted of Perverting the Course of Justice in Son's Rape Case]]></title><description><![CDATA[Naheed Ejaz, a 61-year-old former Labour mayor of Bracknell Forest in Berkshire (serving from 2023 to 2024), was convicted of perverting the course of justice after she obstructed police efforts to arrest her 41-year-old son, Diwan Khan. On September 12, 2024, when officers arrived at their shared home to arrest Khan for the rape of a 15-year-old girl, Ejaz delayed entry for over 90 seconds while speaking to him in Urdu. This gave Khan time to hide his phone, which prosecutors believe contained a video he filmed of the assault. The victim had been given MDMA-laced vodka by Khan, causing her to black out; she awoke undressed in his car with no memory of events, but he later showed her the recording—depicting him choking and slapping her—and threatened to share it or harm her if she spoke out. Khan was convicted of rape and had already pleaded guilty to perverting justice for concealing the device, which was never recovered.

Downey, a predominantly Latino and historically conservative-leaning community in Southeast Los Angeles County, has recently experienced growing activism following federal immigration sweeps in Southern California.

Carlos Aranibar, a local electrician and former public works commissioner active in Democratic politics, describes a personal political awakening after seeing a Customs and Border Protection vehicle near his neighborhood. He later joined nearly 200 residents at a Downey ICE Watch meeting, where attendees organized efforts to monitor immigration enforcement and inform neighbors of potential raids. The movement reflects broader concern among some Latino residents who feel the enforcement actions are impacting their community directly.

Video footage obtained by TMZ captured the heated exchange inside the aircraft cabin, showing Ja Rule visibly upset and repeatedly shouting, “What we doing?” while another voice, believed to be Tony Yayo, responded with expletives. A fellow passenger was seen attempting to calm Ja Rule by placing his hands on his shoulders as tensions escalated.

Following the incident, Ja Rule initially downplayed the altercation on social media, describing it as “hilarious” and claiming he confronted the two men over past comments they had made about him. He also stated that he threw a pillow at Tony Yayo during the argument.

The Estonian agency also indicates that it expects this evaluation to remain consistent in its upcoming strategic analysis.

The article highlights that these conclusions contrast with statements made by several European leaders who have warned of a potential Russian offensive in the coming years. In particular, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is mentioned as one of the officials urging NATO to remain prepared for possible military aggression from Russia. The broader political climate in Brussels is described as increasingly focused on rearmament and the perception of Russia as an existential threat.

Notably, even payments to United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), a partner of Bilt, have been canceled or delayed. Some users report that funds were deducted from their accounts, yet the mortgage provider did not receive the payments.

Rather than simply mimicking vintage equipment, Hultén translates the iconic dual-reel layout into three visible red, green, and blue discs positioned at the top of the device. These discs rotate via stepper motors, providing both functional and visual feedback that reinforces the connection between motion and sound.

Encased in a finely crafted wooden cabinet, RGB 2.0 resembles a piece of mid-century furniture as much as a musical instrument.

Vance emphasized that the objective of the new discussions is to reduce global nuclear risks and prevent additional countries, particularly Iran, from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Speaking outside the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in Manhattan on February 11, Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, confirmed that a court-ordered settlement conference earlier that day was unsuccessful. Although he did not rule out the possibility of further discussions, Freedman indicated uncertainty about whether additional negotiations would take place before the scheduled trial. He also stated that he was prepared to argue the case in court if necessary.

The private meeting was held under the supervision of Magistrate Judge Sarah L. Cave and followed earlier encouragement from Judge Lewis J. Liman, who had urged both parties in December 2025 to consider resolving the matter outside of court.

This sale is not a lottery; tickets will be sold at market price and only the top two pricing tiers are available for each match. The offer is limited to personal Venture X cardholders—business cardholders are excluded. Eligible participants must be in good standing with their accounts and must register a FIFA ID before attempting to purchase tickets. Each cardholder can buy a maximum of four tickets. The sale runs until February 24, 2026, or until tickets are sold out, whichever comes first, and is expected to sell out quickly, similar to a recent Chase cardholder sale.

Lieu claims that the recently released files from the Justice Department indicate potential links between President Donald Trump and criminal activities. According to Lieu, these files contain evidence that Bondi allegedly misrepresented during her testimony, raising questions about transparency and accountability. The accusations come amid ongoing scrutiny over the handling of Epstein-related investigations and the political implications surrounding figures connected to the case. While Bondi has previously been involved in matters related to Trump and Epstein, Lieu's comments suggest that the information released by the Justice Department could contradict her statements under oath.

An additional 10,000 bonus miles can be earned by adding an authorized user within the same period. While the offer wording may be confusing, the flight segment requirement only applies to achieving Silver status, not the bonus miles. This means the status is not automatically granted upon completing the minimum spend, but members have the entire year to complete the required flights.

Unlike many humanoid robots that appear suited for industrial or laboratory environments, Sprout is intentionally crafted to feel at home in everyday human spaces. Its soft, padded body, lightweight materials, and minimized pinch points are aimed at ensuring safer interactions, particularly around children and pets. Distinctive antenna-like eyebrows and a glowing rectangular LED face give the robot an expressive quality, while its movements—walking, kneeling, and crawling—are designed to evoke animated characters rather than machines.

The findings, published in the journal Neurology, indicate that individuals with the highest levels of lifelong cognitive enrichment had a 38% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 36% lower risk of MCI compared with those with the lowest levels.

The study followed 1,939 adults with an average age of 80 who did not have dementia at the outset. Participants were monitored for approximately eight years. Researchers evaluated cognitive enrichment across three life stages: early life (before age 18), midlife (around age 40), and later life (around age 80).

Trump stated that he initially applied a 30% tariff due to a perceived trade imbalance, as the U.S. was running a $42 billion deficit with Switzerland. However, he later increased the tariffs to 39% after a phone call with Swiss Federal Councilor Karin Keller-Sutter, which he described as confrontational. Trump's explanation, emphasizing personal dislike of the tone during the conversation, drew widespread criticism and ridicule online, with many commentators suggesting that his tariff policies are driven more by personal impulses than strategic planning. Last month, Trump announced that the 39% tariff would be lowered to 15% following pressure from Swiss companies, but he warned that it could rise again in the future.

Six Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in supporting the measure, while only one Democrat opposed it. The resolution seeks to terminate the national emergency Trump declared last year, which his administration used to justify imposing tariffs on Canadian imports.

Although the vote represents a symbolic challenge to Trump’s authority, undoing the tariffs would ultimately require presidential approval, which appears unlikely. Trump publicly warned Republicans against backing the resolution, threatening political consequences for those who defied him. He defended the tariffs as essential for economic and national security, arguing that Canada has long taken advantage of US trade policies.

The company cited methodological challenges and shifting patterns in survey participation as key factors influencing the decision. In recent years, declining response rates to polls and the changing ways people consume news and engage in political discourse have made it increasingly difficult to obtain accurate and representative data. While Gallup will cease its continuous approval tracking, it will continue to conduct other types of surveys and research.

The documents detail aspects of the assistant’s employment and include allegations that she was a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein, including an incident in Paris. Her statement forms part of a broader set of investigative materials gathered by federal authorities during the Epstein case.

The video, posted in November 2025, drew harsh public criticism and threats from Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Pirro, who accused the lawmakers of seditious behavior.

During the Cold War, the U.S. grew increasingly concerned about advances in Soviet surface-to-air missile systems, particularly after American U-2 spy planes were shot down in 1960 and 1962. In response, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched Project Harvey in 1974, tasking Lockheed’s Skunk Works with designing an aircraft capable of penetrating enemy airspace with minimal radar detection.

A breakthrough came when Lockheed engineer Denys Overholser studied a paper by Soviet physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev titled “Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction.” Ufimtsev had developed mathematical equations describing how electromagnetic waves scatter off flat and angular surfaces.

The text traces historical precedents from the British Mandate to the first intifada, describing how Palestinian bodies have been harvested for organs, skin, and other purposes, sometimes without consent, while Israeli soldiers’ bodies are treated with strict protection. The piece examines the psychological and political dimensions, noting that the manipulation of bodies serves to reinforce supremacy, instill terror, and support medical and military industries.

The author, nand2mario, is building an 80386-compatible core in SystemVerilog using original Intel microcode extracted from real 386 silicon. The post details how the 386 executes multi-bit shift and rotate instructions in a single cycle using a hybrid barrel shifter. Unlike iterative multiplication and division, the barrel shifter achieves arbitrary shifts through a two-stage design: a coarse 32x8 crossbar shifting by multiples of 4 bits, followed by a fine shifter handling 0–3 bit shifts. The 64-bit input width allows reuse of hardware for different shift and rotate operations. Microcode sequences control the shifter, with instructions like SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR all using the same micro-operations but adjusting the 64-bit input differently. RCL and RCR rotations through the carry flag are handled with special loops, while bit test instructions (BT, BTS, BTR, BTC) leverage a rot]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-the-80386-barrel-shifter-and-its-microcode-implementation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-the-80386-barrel-shifter-and-its-microcode-implementation</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marriott Homes & Villas Offers Up to 10,000 Bonus Bonvoy Points for Eligible Stays of Two Nights or More]]></title><description><![CDATA[Homes & Villas by Marriott has introduced a limited-time promotion for Marriott Bonvoy members, offering 2,000 bonus points per night on eligible home rental stays.

The organization estimates that if current tariff levels remain in place, the cost per household could rise to $1,300 in 2026. The report characterizes the tariffs as the largest U.S. tax increase as a percentage of GDP since 1993, suggesting they have added financial pressure for families already dealing with elevated living expenses.

The Tax Foundation reported that the federal government collected $264 billion in tariff revenue in 2025, a figure significantly lower than the trillions of dollars cited by the White House in public statements. The research also concludes that the economic burden created by the tariffs is likely to offset much of the benefit households might receive from recent tax cuts enacted under Trump’s latest tax legislation.

According to Gaza’s Civil Defence, 2,842 individuals have been classified as “evaporated” since October 2023 after search teams were unable to find bodies following air strikes, aside from blood traces or small fragments. The investigation attributes these disappearances to the use of high-temperature and thermobaric munitions, some of which are manufactured in the United States.

Through survivor testimonies, the report describes families searching hospitals, morgues, and bomb sites without success.

While the official King County Medical Examiner ruled the death a suicide by shotgun, an independent team of forensic scientists, including Brian Burnett, has questioned this conclusion. After examining Cobain’s autopsy and crime scene evidence, the team suggested inconsistencies with a typical suicide, such as organ damage indicative of oxygen deprivation, unusually clean hands, and a highly organized heroin kit. They also raised doubts about the mechanics of handling the heavy shotgun while allegedly incapacitated and discrepancies in the positioning of the body and gun. The alleged suicide note was partially inconsistent, with the top appearing to be written by Cobain about leaving the band, and the bottom lines showing different handwriting.

The piece situates this trend within a broader context already observed among public media and local newspapers, noting similar traffic spikes in cities such as Chicago, Charlotte, and Minneapolis during periods of high-profile ICE activity.

The emails suggest that Ferguson personally contacted Epstein to arrange the visit and lunch at his Palm Beach mansion.

The ship is believed to be monitoring U.S. Navy ship and submarine movements and transmitting relevant information to Iranian authorities.

In addition to maritime surveillance, China has allegedly taken a more assertive stance by publicly releasing geolocated photographs of U.S. military installations.

The masterplan organizes gardens, promenades, plazas, and cultural buildings along a central water axis, turning the canal into the defining feature of the district. Public spaces are prioritized, encouraging gathering, reflection, and interaction along the water’s edge. A new library anchors the development, designed as a composition of interwoven columns clad in masonry tiles inspired by local jade craftsmanship.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed the identification of Sulayem in the document EFTA00666117, although the email address remains redacted. The content of the 'torture video' remains unknown.

According to the author, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent send contradictory signals by publicly endorsing a strong dollar while simultaneously pursuing policies that deliberately weaken it. This strategy has contributed to heightened volatility in global markets, rising gold prices, capital flows into perceived safe havens such as the Swiss franc, and growing unease among international investors.

The weakening of the dollar has far-reaching consequences. Many global assets, including sovereign debt of poorer countries and key commodities such as oil and pharmaceuticals, are priced in U.S. dollars. A falling dollar reduces debt burdens for borrowers but imposes losses on creditors, while also raising import prices for U.S. consumers and potentially ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dollar-volatility-u-s-policy-and-mark-carney-s-proposal-for-a-new-global-reserve-currency</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dollar-volatility-u-s-policy-and-mark-carney-s-proposal-for-a-new-global-reserve-currency</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 04:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saudi Arabia Signs Multi-Billion Dollar Investment Agreements to Rebuild Syria]]></title><description><![CDATA[On February 10, 2026, Syria and Saudi Arabia signed multiple strategic agreements aimed at modernizing Syria's infrastructure and boosting economic recovery. These agreements include the establishment of a joint low-cost airline called 'Nas Syria,' in partnership with Saudi carrier Flynas, which will begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. The airline will be 51% Syrian-owned and 49% Saudi-owned. Another major project, SilkLink, will invest approximately $1 billion to improve Syria's telecommunications network and digital connectivity. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will invest $2 billion in modernizing Aleppo's existing airport and constructing a new one, alongside funding initiatives for seawater desalination and real estate projects in historic Syrian cities. These investments follow the lifting of the US Caesar Act sanctions in December 2025, providing an economic opportunity for the war-torn country, which has seen its GDP drop 54% between 2010 and 2021.

Hosted by Caroline Yoder, the episode breaks down the card’s benefits, potential drawbacks, and ideal use cases in a clear and practical way, aimed at listeners who are considering applying for the card.

The discussion is structured around three main scenarios. First, the hosts consider whether the card makes sense for someone planning a single upcoming Disney vacation. In this case, the analysis focuses on short-term perks such as welcome bonuses, Disney-related discounts, and any immediate savings that could offset the card’s annual fee. Next, the podcast explores the card’s long-term value for regular Disney visitors who primarily spend money on Disney parks, hotels, and merchandise.

Collaborating with designers Marc Newson and Jony Ive from LoveFrom, Ferrari focused on craftsmanship and tactile interaction rather than relying heavily on digital screens. The interior emphasizes high-quality materials, metal finishes, and real switches, creating a sense of presence and sophistication. Displays are integrated subtly, avoiding visual clutter, while controls are designed as objects that invite interaction. Notably, the shifter is a single piece of glass, developed with Corning's Fusion 5 and precision laser drilling to allow hidden illumination, reflecting the meticulous attention to detail. This approach prioritizes simplicity, elegance, and a stronger connection between driver and machine. The exterior design aligns with Ferrari's latest design language for a four-door EV, though technical specifications are still limited.

The piece in question, 'Barbara Rose', was used in the documentary directed by Brett Ratner without Greenwood's consultation. Although Greenwood does not own the copyright to the score, his legal representatives argue that the film's distributor, Universal, violated his composer agreement by allowing a third-party use of the music without approval. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second inauguration, has generated $13.35 million domestically, surpassing initial box office expectations despite criticism.

Under the new system, all accounts will default to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless users verify that they are adults. This means unverified users will be restricted from accessing age-restricted servers and channels, speaking in Stage channels, or viewing content flagged as graphic or sensitive. Additional safety measures include warnings for friend requests from unfamiliar users and filtering direct messages from unknown contacts into a separate inbox.

Existing age-restricted servers will become inaccessible until users complete age verification, even if they were previously members.

Under the promotion, World of Hyatt cardholders earn a total of 3 Hyatt points per dollar on DoorDash restaurant orders. This total is achieved by stacking the card’s standard 2 points per dollar on dining purchases with an additional 1 bonus point per dollar offered during the promotional period. For non-restaurant DoorDash orders, cardholders earn 2 points per dollar, combining the card’s usual 1 point per dollar with the same 1-point bonus.

Many cardholders reported declined transactions and subsequently frozen accounts, causing delays in earning the advertised 5x points on purchases. Verification processes for unlocking accounts required sending a photo with a government ID via email, a method considered insecure and inefficient. Additional problems arose with the 5x rewards offer, particularly for users who applied through The Points Guy (TPG) affiliate link within the first 24 hours. Some were not seeing the 5x points attached to their accounts due to miscommunication with Bilt’s AI chatbot or delays in processing, despite Bilt confirming eligibility via email in some cases.

The initiative seeks to leverage Ukraine's defense industry growth, particularly in drones battle-tested against Russian forces, to enable partners to acquire advanced, proven technologies. Production of Ukrainian drones is scheduled to commence in Germany by mid-February 2026, with Zelenskyy noting he will receive the first unit produced there on a fully operational line. Similar projects already exist in the UK, relying entirely on Ukrainian tech and expertise. With approximately 800 arms producers in Ukraine and over 4 million drones manufactured annually, the sector has become the country's largest industry by wartime financial inflows.

Released on December 8, 2025, the video uses satire to explain the rationale, implications, and controversies surrounding the policy in a way that is both accessible and informative.

According to the article, the ad stands out because it closely mirrors the government’s own messaging while stripping away political spin. It outlines official concerns such as the impact of social media on young people’s mental health, exposure to harmful content, online bullying, and data privacy risks. At the same time, the video highlights unresolved questions about how such a ban would be enforced, what role social media companies would play, and whether age-verification systems could create new privacy or surveillance issues.

Beginning with the work of French geologist Jacques de Morgan in 1892, it highlights how British capitalist William Knox D'Arcy secured exclusive oil rights from the Shah of Persia in 1901. Through complex negotiations, investments, and espionage involving figures like Sidney Reilly, D'Arcy's concession was eventually shared with Burmah Oil, forming the Anglo Persian Oil Company, now known as BP. The discovery of the Abadan oil field in 1908 and the subsequent construction of the world's largest refinery by 1912 cemented Persia's strategic significance. Winston Churchill later intervened to ensure British naval superiority by transitioning the Royal Navy from coal to fuel oil, asserting that petroleum was essential for military and economic power.

Drawing on groundwater data and heat stress research, the piece claims that India’s demographic advantage is rapidly becoming a liability as climate thresholds for human labor are exceeded.

Against this backdrop, India’s foreign policy is framed as a short-term asset liquidation strategy rather than a coherent civilizational project.

In the video, the women urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to stand with Epstein’s victims and called for the truth to be fully revealed, emphasizing solidarity after years of silence.

The discussion gained traction after conservative commentator Matt Walsh shared the PSA and questioned why the women had not publicly named individuals they allege were involved in Epstein’s crimes.

Early in the morning, people gather outside distribution centers to receive essential food supplies as wages fail to cover basic living costs. Families that once managed on two incomes now struggle to pay rent and buy food, with inflation steadily eroding purchasing power. According to Capital Area Food Bank, over one-third of households in the region experienced hunger last year, including some with annual incomes of $90,000 to $120,000. Individuals like Shirleyann Desormeaux, a mother of four, and Salih Taylor, a government worker, are forced to rely on food banks despite having jobs. The rise in food insecurity is exacerbated by reduced government assistance, fewer food stamps, and cuts in subsidies for local organizations. As a result, both longtime residents and asylum seekers are increasingly seeking support from charities and church-run food distributions.

Since May, the DOJ has pursued these records from nearly every state, prompting widespread resistance. More than 20 states have refused and have been sued by the federal government, while at least 10 states—representing over 37 million registered voters—have complied, sometimes under so-called “confidential memoranda of understanding.”

According to the Brennan Center, these agreements reveal unprecedented federal ambitions to intervene directly in state-run election administration. The DOJ proposes to analyze state voter rolls itself and instruct states to remove specific voters within 45 days. This approach would upend long-standing election practices, as states, not the federal government, have legal authority and established]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/justice-department-seeks-state-voter-files-through-confidential-agreements-raising-legal-and-security-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/justice-department-seeks-state-voter-files-through-confidential-agreements-raising-legal-and-security-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exploring the Vibrant 3D Designs of Lea Konaševská]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lea Konaševská’s design work stands out for its vivid use of color, playful forms, and subtle three-dimensionality. Her portfolio, especially visible on Dribbble, showcases a mastery of saturated colors, soft gradients, and sculptural forms that give a sense of being illuminated from within. Each piece, whether a product visualization or abstract artwork, balances boldness with precision, creating a sense of controlled vibrancy. Lipstick renders appear almost sculptural, and product visuals are treated as miniature stage sets. Even the most abstract creations have an underlying structure that enhances their visual impact.

According to court filings, the incident occurred at the Hulu Theater during a sold-out event promoted by Top Rank. Przybyszewski, who was part of a paid security detail, was instructed to remove Lil Tjay from the venue following reports of disruptive behavior. The complaint claims that Lil Tjay spat at a Madison Square Garden employee and that a physical confrontation ensued, resulting in severe cervical and lumbar spine injuries to the officer, including disc damage at the L4–L5 level.

Once overlooked and disorganised, the freezer is now presented as a quiet yet powerful tool that supports better meal planning, reduces food waste, and helps households adapt to busy schedules. With life moving at a fast pace, thoughtful freezer design is shown to contribute to calmer routines and more efficient kitchens.

Rather than simply keeping food frozen, today’s freezers enable families to cook in bulk, store seasonal produce, and preserve leftovers with ease. The article highlights how intuitive layouts, smooth-gliding drawers, and clearly defined compartments make daily interactions simpler and less stressful. These seemingly small design improvements reduce time spent searching for food and encourage better storage habits, which ultimately lead to a more organised home environment.

Pond lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes. Strategically placed lights improve safety by highlighting pond edges and pathways, reducing the risk of accidents, and enhancing security by deterring intruders. Various lighting options are available: submersible lights offer an ethereal glow beneath the water, floating lights provide easy installation and can be solar-powered, while spotlights and uplights draw attention to specific features like waterfalls, fountains, or statues. Fibre optic lighting mimics starlight effects without electricity entering the water, and path lights illuminate walkways while contributing ambient light to the pond area.

Speaking on Czech television channel TN.cz, Babiš stated that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in April 2022 were close to producing a peace agreement before they were abruptly derailed. According to him, the turning point came after a visit to Ukraine by then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom Babiš directly blamed for disrupting the negotiation process.

Babiš argued that the failure to conclude talks at that time eliminated the possibility of a rapid end to the conflict and prolonged the war. He did not provide documentary evidence for his claims but presented them as his political assessment of events during the early months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The author traces the emergence of this system from early Rome through the Middle and Late Republic, noting that prior to the 4th century B.C., Roman military equipment and tactics were heavily influenced by Greek and Italic practices. Archaeological and literary evidence suggests that key transitions—such as the adoption of the scutum, Montefortino helmets, La Tène-style swords, and the pilum—coincided with Rome's post-Gallic sack military reforms, centralizing the army and expanding recruitment. The pilum is highlighted as a particularly unusual weapon, heavier than standard javelins and designed with a long iron shank to penetrate shields and armor. Unlike lighter javelins, the pilum could maintain its momentum to potentially harm multiple ranks of enemy soldiers, and the bending of the shan]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX Delays Mars Missions and Reorients Starship Program Toward the Moon]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes a major strategic shift by SpaceX following recent statements by Elon Musk confirming that Starship missions to Mars will not take place for at least five to seven years, effectively delaying any serious Martian effort until the early 2030s. This represents a dramatic departure from Musk’s long-standing narrative, in which Mars colonization was portrayed as an imminent and overriding priority. Instead, SpaceX will now focus its Starship program primarily on the Moon, aligning more closely with NASA’s Artemis program and U.S. geopolitical objectives in cislunar space.

According to the author, the shift is driven by practical constraints rather than visionary reassessment. SpaceX faces intense pressure to deliver an uncrewed lunar Human Landing System (HLS) mission by March 2027 in order to keep Artemis III on schedule for 2028. Achieving this requires rapid progress on complex technologies such as orbital propellant transfer, tanker Starships, and lunar-optimized v]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spacex-delays-mars-missions-and-reorients-starship-program-toward-the-moon</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spacex-delays-mars-missions-and-reorients-starship-program-toward-the-moon</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andrew Tate dismisses reading, claiming he prefers thrill-seeking over books]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andrew Tate, a controversial social media influencer, recently stated in a resurfaced clip on X that he believes reading is for people with 'slow brains.'

Since the 2014 coup, Ukraine has been a frontline state for NATO against Russia, receiving military support and diplomatic backing from Western countries, while suffering significant human and territorial losses. Recently, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz openly stated that Ukraine's EU membership in early 2027 is 'simply impossible,' emphasizing that all candidate countries must go through the strict Copenhagen criteria. This announcement underscores that no special path exists for Ukraine, and its extensive sacrifices will not be immediately rewarded.

Known as the “White Swan” due to its white exterior, the Tu-160 is presented as one of the most imposing bombers ever built, combining high speed, long range, and heavy payload capacity. Constructed from titanium, aluminum and steel alloys, and composite materials, the aircraft is capable of exceeding Mach 2 thanks to its four engines and variable-sweep wings.

According to the article, the Tu-160 can carry up to 45 tons of ordnance, including cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear warheads, making it a central component of Russia’s strategic deterrence. Its long endurance—exceeding ten hours and extendable through aerial refueling—allows it to conduct intercontinental missions.

The report argues that this corporate involvement represents a shift from what it calls an “economy of occupation” to an “economy of genocide,” alleging that commercial profits are increasingly intertwined with military actions that may constitute violations of international law.

The deal, finalized in September and awarded without competitive bidding, represents the largest known U.S. weapons purchase from an Israeli company in available federal records. It marks a reversal of the usual arms flow between the two countries, with the United States buying, rather than supplying, weapons to Israel.

Cluster munitions are widely criticized and banned by 112 countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions due to their indiscriminate effects and the long-term danger posed by unexploded bomblets.

The tanker, owned by the Turkish Besiktas Shipping company, was flying the Panamanian flag but was part of Russia’s ‘phantom fleet.’ It had left Taman Port in Russia in August. The attack led to an extensive operation to prevent an oil spill, including deploying Senegal's ‘Plan Polmar,’ involving tugboats and rescue ships. The 22 crew members, mostly Turkish nationals, were evacuated.

Proposed by Chris Williamson, the concept envisions a high-speed rail network that forms a continuous circle, linking cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin, and Bangor. Unlike traditional rail networks, which have fixed endpoints, The Loop offers a more fluid, circular connection, allowing cities to interact more like interconnected neighborhoods. This continuous, rhythmical system offers more than just practicality; it carries an emotional resonance, representing movement and relationship rather than a linear journey from point A to point B.

It aims to show how scientists work in the cosmetic field, emphasizing that product development is grounded in evidence, safety, and rigorous validation rather than marketing alone.

The development of a new cosmetic begins with identifying a clear objective: defining the skin concern to address, the target consumer, and the expected benefits. Ideas may arise from market trends, unmet consumer needs, scientific evidence, or innovation in new ingredients developed through basic research. Once the objective is established, scientific literature is reviewed to select ingredients and technologies that best align with the intended mechanism of action.

It traces the evolution of regional movements in Catalonia, the Basque Country, Galicia, and other territories, highlighting their shift from regionalism to independence demands due to perceived neglect by Madrid. The text discusses how the 2011 15M movement and the emergence of parties like Ciudadanos, VOX, and Podemos reflected the need for political renewal. Recent regional elections demonstrate a resurgence of local parties, such as Bloque Nacionalista Galego, Chunta Aragonesista, Por Ávila, and ¡Soria Ya!, challenging the traditional dominance of PSOE and PP.

Designed by Italian-Haitian fashion designer Stella Jean, each uniform was hand-painted by artisans and incorporated motifs reflecting Haiti’s history and heritage. Initially, the designs were to feature Toussaint Louverture, a Haitian revolutionary leader, inspired by artist Édouard Duval-Carrié. However, the International Olympic Committee prohibited political imagery, prompting a redesign that emphasized a symbolic red horse instead. These uniforms go beyond athletic apparel, serving as a moving canvas of identity and resilience. They represent Haiti’s artistic richness and national pride, bringing stories of struggle, beauty, and cultural strength onto the global stage. The garments highlight how fashion can carry deeper meaning, particularly for nations facing challenges, and showcase the work of designers who merge art, heritage, and sport.

While the Iranian government bears primary responsibility for suppressing dissent, criminalizing reform, and mismanaging the economy, the author contends that Western policies—especially those of the United States—have deliberately undermined the social forces most capable of producing peaceful change.

For more than two decades, many Iranians sought gradual reform through elections, civic mobilization, and support for reformist leaders. This strategy depended heavily on economic stability and the growth of a confident middle class, historically the engine of social and political change in Iran. According to the article, U.S. sanctions were designed not merely to pressure the government, but to collapse the economy]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-u-s-sanctions-and-internal-repression-closed-the-path-to-peaceful-change-in-iran</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-u-s-sanctions-and-internal-repression-closed-the-path-to-peaceful-change-in-iran</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discussion on the Real Value of Delta Credit Card Welcome Offers and SkyTeam Strategies]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article accompanies an episode of Frequent Miler’s “Ask Us Anything” podcast recorded live on February 4, 2026, where the hosts address a wide range of reader and listener questions related to credit cards, airline loyalty programs, and points-and-miles strategy. A central topic discussed is whether Delta credit card welcome offers are often undervalued when compared to other airline cards, particularly in light of Delta’s 15% award discount benefit for cardholders. The hosts explain how this discount effectively increases the purchasing power of SkyMiles, reframing a 90,000-mile bonus as having greater real-world value when used for award flights.

Beyond Delta-specific questions, the episode covers practical concerns faced by everyday points enthusiasts.

According to the records, the tip was sent to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center and later forwarded internally, but Mark Epstein says no law enforcement agency ever contacted him to follow up.

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it has long been the subject of speculation and conspiracy theories. In his FBI submission, Mark Epstein asserted that his brother was killed because he was 'about to name names,' and claimed to believe Trump was responsible. The publicly released file includes the allegation but redacts Epstein’s personal contact details.

Martinez secured 62% of the vote, defeating Republican Brad Daigle, who received 38%, according to unofficial results from the Louisiana Secretary of State. The election was triggered after the previous Democratic representative was appointed as a commissioner for Louisiana's Department of Alcohol & Tobacco. While this victory did not represent a party flip, it marked a significant 37-point swing from the previous presidential results in the district. Martinez, a former Iberville Parish councilwoman, emphasized local issues and affordability during her campaign and managed to overcome a 3-to-1 funding disadvantage against her Republican opponent.

Deception Island is an active volcanic caldera shaped like a horseshoe and home to vast colonies of chinstrap penguins, seals, and numerous seabird species. Human presence there is rare and limited mainly to scientists, historians, and tourists who visit during the Antarctic summer.

Despite its isolation, the island bears traces of intense human activity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Seal hunters nearly exterminated local seal populations in the early 1800s, followed decades later by large-scale whaling operations that left behind industrial structures. During World War II, the United Kingdom established Station B on the island to prevent Nazi naval use, constructing buildings such as aircraft hangars, many of which still stand today. These structures are protected as historical monuments under the Antarctic Treaty.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/graffiti-vandalism-reaches-antarctica-s-deception-island-historic-site</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/graffiti-vandalism-reaches-antarctica-s-deception-island-historic-site</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 02:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Political Backlash Erupts After U.S. Olympians Speak Out on Immigration Policies]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a political controversy that unfolded during the opening days of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, as several U.S. athletes publicly expressed discomfort with representing the United States amid ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Freestyle skier Hunter Hess said that wearing the U.S. flag brought 'mixed emotions,' clarifying that representing the country did not mean endorsing all government actions. Figure skater Amber Glenn echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that politics affects everyone and should not be ignored.

These comments sparked an intense backlash from prominent figures within the MAGA movement and conservative media. Commentators and influencers including Megyn Kelly, Jack Posobiec, Marc Thiessen, and Jake Paul accused the athletes of being unpatriotic, with some openly stating they were rooting against Team USA.

The dinner also included Peter Thiel and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden. While the event was first reported by Vanity Fair in 2019, the new files, released by the Justice Department on January 30, 2026, have sparked renewed attention. Epstein, who was convicted in 2008 for procuring a minor for prostitution, maintained relationships with influential figures, despite his criminal past.

A través de sus viajes a Dakar, Carolina del Sur y Palestina, analiza las consecuencias del colonialismo, la expropiación y la destrucción cultural, subrayando cómo los relatos oficiales sirven a menudo para levantar muros morales entre los opresores y sus víctimas.

El relato presenta un mundo distópico marcado por la degradación ecológica, el autoritarismo y la desigualdad social, donde un protagonista sin nombre es condenado a trabajos forzados en un entorno exterior devastado por el sol.

La formación surge de la confluencia de varios grupúsculos ultras que adquirieron visibilidad durante las protestas frente a la sede del PSOE en la calle Ferraz en 2023.

El presidente de la entidad, , percibió 9,1 millones de euros, un 14,7% más que el año anterior, y acumula una pensión cercana a los 30 millones de euros tras nuevas aportaciones al plan. Por su parte, el consejero delegado, , ganó 8,1 millones, lo que supone un aumento del 11,1%, aunque sin plan de pensiones, al cobrar esa retribución en otros conceptos.

Ambos directivos mantienen oficialmente congelado su sueldo fijo, situado en torno a los 2-3 millones anuales, pero el grueso de su retribución procede de variables y otros incentivos. Esta situación contrasta con la evolución salarial del resto de la plantilla: la remuneración media de los trabajadores del banco se mantuvo en 48.000 euros anuales, sin subida alguna por primera vez desde 2021.

UU. para prohibir la fijación dinámica y personalizada de precios en supermercados]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un grupo de senadores demócratas de Estados Unidos ha presentado un proyecto de ley para frenar el uso de tecnologías de vigilancia y de precios dinámicos en los grandes supermercados. La iniciativa, denominada Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026, busca impedir que los comercios modifiquen los precios de los alimentos en tiempo real o de forma personalizada mediante algoritmos, reconocimiento facial u otros sistemas automatizados.

La propuesta obligaría a las tiendas a revelar si utilizan tecnologías de reconocimiento facial y prohibiría el uso de etiquetas electrónicas de precios en los grandes establecimientos, ya que estas permiten cambiar los precios de manera remota e instantánea. Los legisladores temen que estos sistemas puedan emplearse para cobrar importes distintos por el mismo producto en función de factores como la hora del día, el comportamiento del cliente o incluso características personales como ingresos, raza o género.

La preocupación no es solo teórica. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/propuesta-legislativa-en-ee-uu-para-prohibir-la-fijacion-dinamica-y-personalizada-de-precios-en-supermercados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/propuesta-legislativa-en-ee-uu-para-prohibir-la-fijacion-dinamica-y-personalizada-de-precios-en-supermercados</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 23:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El F-35 y la dependencia de Europa hacia los Estados Unidos: análisis de un experto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El F-35, avión de combate de Lockheed Martin, ha generado un gran debate sobre la dependencia de Europa hacia Estados Unidos. El experto militar Joseph Henrotin explica que este avión no es solo un avión, sino un sistema integrado en redes que requiere constantes actualizaciones de software y mantenimiento a través de servidores estadounidenses. Además, las piezas del F-35, aunque fabricadas en Europa, siguen siendo propiedad de los Estados Unidos, lo que limita la autonomía de los países europeos. Henrotin también destaca que la interoperabilidad, la presencia de armas nucleares estadounidenses y la falta de inversión europea en defensa explican por qué los países optaron por este avión. Aunque algunos países como España y Canadá se han mostrado reticentes, el F-35 sigue siendo un éxito comercial, con más de 3.400 unidades previstas. Sin embargo, el experto señala que el avión presenta importantes limitaciones técnicas y de rendimiento, como la falta de maniobrabilidad y un motor que ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-f-35-y-la-dependencia-de-europa-hacia-los-estados-unidos-analisis-de-un-experto</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-f-35-y-la-dependencia-de-europa-hacia-los-estados-unidos-analisis-de-un-experto</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 22:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El coste oculto de las renovables: Cómo los servicios de ajuste afectan a la factura de la luz]]></title><description><![CDATA[En febrero de 2026, la fuerte integración de energías renovables, especialmente la fotovoltaica y la eólica, ha incrementado el precio de los 'servicios de ajuste' en el sistema eléctrico español, anulando en parte los beneficios de la caída del precio mayorista de la electricidad. Aunque el precio mayorista ha bajado, los consumidores están pagando hasta tres veces más por los ajustes necesarios para estabilizar el sistema debido a la variabilidad de la producción renovable. A pesar de que la electricidad renovable es más barata, la necesidad de ajustar la oferta y la demanda en tiempo real eleva estos costes, sumándose a otros factores como los impuestos y las primas a las renovables. Este incremento en los 'servicios de ajuste' ha elevado los costes hasta niveles superiores a los del año anterior, incluso superando los costes operativos de las plantas convencionales, como los ciclos combinados.

Según el gobierno británico, la toxina se administró mientras estaba bajo custodia en una prisión del Ártico ruso, donde cumplía una condena por su activismo político. La epibatidina, conocida por su potencia, es aproximadamente 200 veces más fuerte que la morfina y causa la muerte por insuficiencia respiratoria. A pesar de las afirmaciones del Kremlin de que Navalny murió de causas naturales, pruebas toxicológicas y testimonios familiares apuntan a un asesinato deliberado bajo supervisión estatal. Este asesinato se suma a un patrón de hostilidades contra Navalny, quien ya había sobrevivido a un intento de asesinato en 2020 con Novichok, un agente nervioso.

El libro compara los genocidios de Namibia, perpetrado por Alemania en 1904 contra los pueblos herero y namaa, y el de Gaza, donde la población palestina sufre desplazamientos masivos y destrucción de infraestructuras vitales.

Tras décadas de alteraciones paisajísticas y ecológicas por la construcción de remontes, telesillas, chalets y pistas, la Comunidad de Madrid decidió recuperar la montaña a su estado natural. El proyecto, llevado a cabo de forma manual por operarios especializados y siguiendo estrictos criterios ecológicos, implicó la retirada de bloques de hormigón, pilonas y otras infraestructuras, así como la restauración de suelos y cursos de agua.

El proyecto planeaba estudiar a 14.000 recién nacidos distribuyéndolos en dos grupos: uno recibiría la vacuna al nacer y el otro a las seis semanas. La OMS advierte que no vacunar a la mitad de los recién nacidos podría exponerlos a un alto riesgo de infección y muerte, dado que la vacuna es segura y eficaz y ha estado disponible durante más de 14 años. Aunque Guinea-Bissau aplica actualmente la vacuna a los seis meses, la OMS recomienda que en países con alta prevalencia de hepatitis B, como Guinea-Bissau (19 % de la población), la dosis se administre dentro de las primeras 24 horas de vida. El director general de la OMS, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, enfatizó que negar acceso a la vacuna es éticamente inaceptable, aunque reconoció que un país soberano p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oms-critica-estudio-de-vacunacion-en-guinea-bissau-por-riesgos-eticos-y-sanitarios</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oms-critica-estudio-de-vacunacion-en-guinea-bissau-por-riesgos-eticos-y-sanitarios</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 17:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rakitic analiza la evolución del Barça y destaca el talento de la nueva generación]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ivan Rakitic repasa su trayectoria y reflexiona sobre la situación actual del FC Barcelona, señalando que pequeños detalles no gestionados correctamente y las lesiones han generado problemas en el equipo.

Además de ser un ordenador transportable, contaba con un equipo de audio que incluía radio FM/SW/MW, micrófono y controles de sonido. La peculiaridad de su diseño es que usaba un radiocasete para cargar y grabar programas, un método habitual en los microordenadores de la época.

Empresas como Rilla en Nueva York buscan empleados con características extremas, como la ambición infinita y el deseo de trabajar sin descanso. El auge de este modelo responde a la presión por desarrollar rápidamente inteligencia artificial y otras tecnologías punteras, donde se teme que otro competidor pueda adelantarse. Sin embargo, esta cultura del trabajo ininterrumpido ha generado críticas, especialmente por sus efectos negativos sobre la salud, como el agotamiento y las enfermedades cardíacas.

El principal sospechoso, Alberto S. M., fue detenido por presunto secuestro y violación, y se le vincula también con tráfico de drogas. Según las investigaciones, el captor podría haber comprado el silencio de la vecina a cambio de sustancias estupefacientes. La víctima logró escapar aprovechando un descuido de su captor y caminó varios kilómetros hasta la casa de su ex pareja para pedir ayuda.

A partir del caso de Rocío, una pequeña inversora que gestiona cinco pisos propios y otros tantos mediante el modelo conocido como rent to rent, se expone cómo este tipo de alquiler fragmentado se ha convertido en una fuente de rentabilidad para propietarios particulares. Rocío alquila en total 75 habitaciones con precios en torno a los 400 euros mensuales, una cifra habitual en ciudades medias y grandes como Bilbao o Zaragoza.

El texto contextualiza este fenómeno con datos oficiales: aunque alrededor del 75 % de los hogares españoles vive en viviendas en propiedad, el mercado del alquiler está dominado mayoritariamente por familias y pequeños propietarios, mientras que los grandes tenedores, aunque minoritarios, concentran parte de la oferta en las grandes capitales.

El paquete incluye chalés, pisos de lujo, garajes, parcelas rústicas y atraques para embarcaciones repartidos por distintos puntos de España, como Ibiza, Madrid, Marbella, Sotogrande, Tarifa o Algeciras.

En un intento de acercarse al electorado afroamericano, el entonces candidato republicano invitó a subir al escenario a una niña afroamericana que se encontraba entre el público junto a sus padres. Trump elogió repetidamente su aspecto físico, destacando lo “guapa” que era, y felicitó a los padres por su crianza, en un tono que muchos consideraron innecesario e incómodo.

Una vez en el escenario, Trump levantó a la niña y le dio un beso en la mejilla ante el público, acompañado de gestos de aprobación. Posteriormente, cuando parecía que el momento había concluido, volvió a inclinarse hacia ella para intentar darle un segundo beso.

Se habla de ‘viajar a las ideas’, una tendencia que implica la inmersión en conceptos como el arte, la arquitectura o la historia, transformando el viaje en una especie de expedición cultural. Este enfoque no busca solo el turismo superficial, sino que convierte cada destino en una hipótesis visual, que invita a explorar las capas profundas de la historia y la cultura. Ejemplos de esta nueva visión incluyen visitas a lugares emblemáticos de la Bauhaus o el modernismo, donde cada rincón y cada detalle arquitectónico son leídos desde una perspectiva intelectual.

La aparición de estos documentos provocó una reacción inmediata de inversores y empresas asociadas, que comenzaron a desvincularse de la multinacional para proteger su reputación.

El director de Un Watch, Hillel Neuer, compartió el vídeo en redes sociales, fomentando su circulación entre seguidores pro-Israel, y finalmente alcanzó relevancia institucional. Un Watch, fundada en 1993 por Morris Abram, ha llevado a cabo ataques similares contra otros enviados especiales de la ONU como Richard Falk y Michael Lynk, todos ellos críticos con la política israelí en Palestina.

A través del lenguaje propio de la sátira gráfica, la obra denuncia cómo la atención internacional, simbolizada por las cámaras de los grandes medios, se retira mientras la violencia, las violaciones de derechos humanos y el sufrimiento de la población civil continúan sin interrupción.

La viñeta no necesita texto explicativo: su mensaje se apoya en la potencia de la imagen y en el contexto político que la rodea. El foco está en la relación directa entre visibilidad mediática y responsabilidad internacional. Cuando hay cámaras, parece existir una cierta contención, una presión externa que obliga a los actores implicados a justificar o moderar sus acciones.

El estudio revela además que los hombres son los más afectados en el ámbito religioso, mientras que en el conjunto de abusos sexuales siendo menores de edad, las mujeres son mayoría. La encuesta también destaca que un 72% de los españoles consideran el abuso sexual infantil un problema social muy grave y un 24,4% como bastante grave, pero la mayoría cree que las medidas adoptadas para prevenirlo son insuficientes.

Diana y Luisa, ambas de origen colombiano, relatan cómo su situación administrativa irregular las ha obligado a aceptar condiciones laborales abusivas, jornadas excesivas y salarios por debajo del mínimo legal, sin derechos básicos como vacaciones, finiquito o protección frente a despidos.

Diana explica el desgaste físico y emocional sufrido como camarera de piso, con ritmos de trabajo inasumibles y una presión constante que afectó gravemente a su salud. Luisa, por su parte, describe jornadas de hasta 21 horas cuidando a una persona mayor encamada, con un fuerte impacto en su espalda y su calidad de vida.

Fundado en 1941, el Patronato carecía de infraestructuras propias y, por ello, recurrió a órdenes religiosas como las Adoratrices y las Oblatas, que aportaron edificios y personal para gestionar los centros del organismo. Según Consuelo García del Cid, estas monjas ejercían un poder autoritario sobre las jóvenes, describiéndolas como 'absolutamente nazis' y carceleras, actuando bajo la apariencia de autoridad religiosa. Los centros funcionaban como hogares, refugios y conventos al servicio del Estado, transformando a las congregaciones religiosas en piezas clave de la estructura operativa del Patronato. Esta colaboración permitió que la institución franquista impusiera un control moral y social sobre las mujeres, justificando sus medidas en nombre de Dios, aunque, según la propia García del Cid, ese Dios no estaba presente en ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rol-de-las-ordenes-religiosas-en-el-patronato-de-proteccion-a-la-mujer-durante-el-franquismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rol-de-las-ordenes-religiosas-en-el-patronato-de-proteccion-a-la-mujer-durante-el-franquismo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 12:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acusaciones de que cuentas oficiales del Gobierno de EE. UU. han reutilizado símbolos y frases asociadas con movimientos neonazis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante el último año, diversas cuentas oficiales del Gobierno de Estados Unidos, incluyendo las del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y la Casa Blanca, han publicado en redes sociales contenidos que imitan memes, con arte generado por IA y lemas patrióticos, que en apariencia son mensajes de promoción institucional.

Entre las medidas exigidas a TikTok se incluyen la eliminación del desplazamiento infinito, la introducción de pausas obligatorias de tiempo de uso y cambios en sus sistemas de recomendación. Según la Comisión, estas funciones contribuyen a un consumo compulsivo que puede afectar a la salud mental de los usuarios.

Esta información, hallada entre millones de documentos desclasificados y difundidos tras una nueva ley de transparencia, contradice declaraciones posteriores de Trump, quien durante años sostuvo que no tenía conocimiento alguno de los delitos de Epstein.

Las manifestaciones fueron duramente reprimidas, con denuncias de miles de muertos según organizaciones de derechos humanos. En este contexto, Estados Unidos introdujo de contrabando alrededor de 6.000 terminales de internet satelital Starlink en Irán, según informó The Wall Street Journal. La posesión, compra o uso de estos equipos en el país persa es un delito penado con entre seis meses y dos años de prisión, además de la incautación del terminal. El Departamento de Estado adquirió unas 7.000 unidades entre finales de 2025 y enero de 2026, y se confirma que Donald Trump estaba al tanto de las operaciones. El objetivo de estas entregas era garantizar que los iraníes pudieran acceder a Internet pese al bloqueo impuesto por el régimen.

La iniciativa se materializa en un vídeo difundido en el canal oficial de YouTube de la CIA, producido en mandarín y protagonizado por un personaje ficticio: un oficial de rango medio del Ejército Popular de Liberación que decide contactar con la agencia estadounidense tras concluir que los líderes de China actúan movidos por intereses personales y sustentan su poder en la mentira.

El vídeo muestra al supuesto militar en escenas cotidianas con su familia y en desplazamientos nocturnos, hasta que, desde su coche, utiliza un ordenador portátil para enviar un mensaje en el que afirma que colaborar es su forma de luchar por su familia y su país.

José Manuel Gómez Jurado, diputado de Por Andalucía, aprovechó el debate para responder a un comentario de la diputada de Vox, Purificación Fernández, sobre la gestión del agua en la región. Con ironía y un esquema básico del ciclo del agua, explicó cómo el agua de los ríos llega al mar, destacando la importancia de este proceso para la regeneración de los bancos de peces y la sostenibilidad de la pesca. Gómez Jurado también aprovechó para subrayar que la regularización de inmigrantes es una medida de justicia y necesaria, resaltando que la mayoría de los beneficiarios han trabajado en España y contribuyen al país.

Este hecho ha despertado polémica, ya que estas viviendas están destinadas a personas con rentas inferiores a 54.600 euros, incrementables hasta 66.000 en determinados casos. La adquisición de la vivienda se realizó en septiembre de 2025 mediante adjudicación y un préstamo bancario de 164.000 euros, incluyendo también una plaza de aparcamiento y un trastero, con acceso a piscina, pistas de pádel y club social.

Para contener la propagación, se ha activado un control epidemiológico que incluye el aislamiento de los casos confirmados y la vacunación de los contactos directos. Este brote coincide con la pérdida del estatus de España como país libre de sarampión, recordando la importancia de la vacunación como medida preventiva. El sarampión, enfermedad aguda y altamente contagiosa causada por un virus de la familia paramyxovirus, puede transmitirse incluso cuatro días antes de aparecer los primeros síntomas. La enfermedad presenta fiebre, exantema, tos, rinitis y conjuntivitis, aunque en personas vacunadas los síntomas pueden ser atípicos.

La sentencia de apelación reduce de siete a cuatro años de prisión las penas más elevadas para dos de los agentes, absuelve a un tercero que había sido condenado a tres años y mantiene un año de cárcel para un cuarto agente.

El núcleo de la rebaja se encuentra en la reinterpretación del delito de detención ilegal. Mientras que la Audiencia de Barcelona consideró que se trataba de la modalidad más grave, castigada con hasta tres años de prisión, el TSJC entiende que la detención fue “leve” al valorar que el joven fue conducido de forma inmediata a dependencias policiales. Este criterio transforma la pena de cárcel por este delito en una multa de 540 euros.

Desde el departamento que dirige Óscar Puente se ha calificado la dimisión como un relevo normal dentro de la estructura administrativa y se ha anunciado que ya se trabaja en la búsqueda de una persona sustituta.

Los hurtos se produjeron en los polígonos de Granda II, Proni-Meres y Nueva Granda, afectando tanto a instalaciones de alumbrado como al hormigonado y cajas de farolas. Las investigaciones se basaron en imágenes de cámaras de seguridad que permitieron identificar al vehículo y al presunto autor. Además, se comprobó que el hombre había vendido parte del material robado en un centro de gestión de residuos local, lo que reforzó la línea de investigación.

Su caso forma parte de las 735 muertes por accidentes laborales registradas en 2025, una cifra inferior a la del año anterior pero todavía considerada inaceptable por sindicatos y expertos.

Los datos del Ministerio de Trabajo reflejan una reducción de la siniestralidad y del índice de incidencia, pero también evidencian focos especialmente graves, como el sector de la construcción, que concentra el mayor número de fallecimientos y ha empeorado sus cifras.

A través de vídeos en redes sociales, creadoras como Kylie Brewer muestran desde dentro el lenguaje, las ideas y la dinámica de estos espacios, caracterizados por una fuerte misoginia, racismo y deshumanización de las mujeres. El artículo explica el origen del término “incel”, que nació en los años noventa como un espacio de apoyo mutuo, y cómo con el tiempo evolucionó hacia una subcultura marcada por el resentimiento y una ideología fatalista conocida como “blackpill”.

La pieza también recoge estudios académicos y advertencias de organismos de seguridad que vinculan estas comunidades con procesos de radicalización y con un aumento del riesgo de violencia en el mundo real.

Según los profesionales consultados, la ley endurece las penas para hurtos reiterados, pero no aborda los problemas estructurales del sistema judicial ni penitenciario. Muchos reincidentes, con decenas de antecedentes por robos o delitos violentos, siguen quedando en libertad, lo que provoca frustración entre los cuerpos policiales. Los agentes critican también que las cárceles no cumplen su función disuasoria ni rehabilitadora, describiéndolas como una “universidad de delincuentes” donde los internos aprenden y se relacionan entre ellos antes de volver a delinquir. Pese a ello, destacan que el control sobre los reincidentes es riguroso, registrando huellas y antecedentes de manera efectiva.

La resolución del Servicio Territorial de Medio Ambiente de León permite retomar la caza siete meses después de los incendios, según informes técnicos y condiciones del territorio. El partido ecologista considera que esta decisión es irresponsable y evidencia la falta de compromiso del presidente de la Junta, Alfonso Fernández Mañueco, con la protección del medio ambiente, acusándolo de actuar en interés de los lobbies cinegéticos y de ignorar la conservación de los ecosistemas.

Cuentas asociadas al movimiento MAGA y comentaristas conservadores han difundido mensajes extremos, llegando a sugerir que Europa debería actuar contra él sin importar los métodos. Estas publicaciones se han centrado especialmente en la política migratoria de España, presentándola de manera descontextualizada y, en algunos casos, manipulando vídeos para dar la impresión de 'invasiones masivas' de personas africanas hacia Europa. Uno de los mensajes más virales provino del comentarista Joey Mannarino, cuyas publicaciones incluso han sido compartidas por Donald Trump.

Martin Green, director del certamen, calificó la decisión como “difícil” y señaló que surgieron problemas imprevistos que no pudieron resolverse a tiempo por productores y promotores. Se ha confirmado que los compradores recibirán el reembolso completo de sus entradas, pero todavía no hay una fecha alternativa para relanzar la gira. Esta cancelación se suma a la polémica en torno a la participación de Israel en el festival, que motivó la retirada de España, Países Bajos, Irlanda, Eslovenia e Islandia, reduciendo el número de delegaciones a 35, la cifra más baja desde 2003.

Tras un largo proceso burocrático en diversas entidades, la Oficina de Igualdad de Trato y No-Discriminación (OITND) de la Generalitat de Cataluña falló a favor de Hamid, imponiendo a la agencia una sanción de 10.001 euros.

Desde el escenario, el consultor energético Bob McNally, exasesor del presidente George W. Bush, afirmó que Irán representa el mayor potencial para la industria si se produjera un acercamiento político con Estados Unidos, llegando a calificar una guerra de cambio de régimen como beneficiosa no solo para Washington y el sector petrolero, sino incluso para la “paz mundial”.

La mayor parte termina incinerada, enterrada o dispersa en el medio ambiente. Las causas son diversas y están interconectadas: desde plantas de reciclaje poco eficientes y sistemas de recogida inadecuados, hasta la baja calidad del material reciclado y la falta de profesionalización del sector. Además, muchos plásticos de un solo uso y productos diseñados para no reciclarse complican la tarea. Exportar residuos a otros países tampoco resuelve el problema y la participación ciudadana, aunque importante, no es suficiente. En definitiva, el reciclaje de plástico no es una solución mágica, sino una herramienta dentro de un enfoque más amplio que requiere reducción del consumo, reutilización, ecodiseño y economía circular.

Gómez defiende que retrasar la edad de jubilación es la medida “más barata” para la Seguridad Social, ya que reduce el número de prestaciones pagadas y aumenta los ingresos por cotizaciones. Recuerda que ya impulsó el aumento de la edad legal de jubilación de 65 a 67 años, proceso que culmina en 2027, y advierte de que a partir de entonces podría abrirse la puerta a nuevos retrasos, aunque con diferencias según sectores, dado que no todos los trabajos permiten alargar la vida laboral en las mismas condiciones.

La denuncia, presentada en mayo de 2025, sostiene que la Agencia de Seguridad Nacional (NSA) no difundió un informe de inteligencia sobre dicha conversación, como sería habitual, y que Gabbard optó por entregar una copia en papel a la jefa de gabinete de la Casa Blanca, Susie Wiles, solicitando además información adicional solo para su oficina.

Aquest jo que jo soc*, una obra que recorre la trayectoria vital, artística y política del cantautor valenciano que se convirtió en una de las voces más incómodas del franquismo. A los 85 años, Raimon vive retirado, busca el silencio y rehúye la nostalgia, pero su figura sigue anclada en el imaginario colectivo como símbolo de resistencia cultural y política.

La autora considera inaceptable que varios miembros del jurado, encabezados por su presidente Wim Wenders, hayan evitado condenar explícitamente lo que ella califica como un genocidio contra el pueblo palestino y hayan defendido que el arte no debería ser político.

Roy ha explicado que su decisión llega tras escuchar declaraciones públicas del jurado en las que se eludía pronunciarse sobre Palestina, pese a que la Berlinale sí ha condenado en otras ocasiones diversas injusticias y conflictos internacionales. Para la escritora, afirmar que el arte debe mantenerse al margen de la política supone, en este contexto, una forma de silenciar un crimen de lesa humanidad que se está produciendo ante los ojos del mundo.

El texto parte del testimonio de Maria Farmer, una de las primeras mujeres que denunció a Epstein ante el FBI en 1996 tras ser agredida en una propiedad de Wexner en Ohio, sin que las autoridades actuaran entonces.

Wexner, fundador del imperio textil The Limited y responsable del éxito global de , concedió a Epstein en 1991 un poder notarial extraordinariamente amplio que le permitía gestionar su fortuna sin límites efectivos. Durante años, Epstein fue su asesor financiero exclusivo, pese a las advertencias explícitas de colaboradores cercanos que desconfiaban de él.

La víctima, de 38 años, logró escapar aprovechando que su captor dormía, saltó el muro de la casa y caminó varios kilómetros hasta pedir ayuda a su expareja, quien la trasladó al médico.

Según fuentes judiciales, la mujer presentaba un grave deterioro físico tras un largo periodo sin atención sanitaria: múltiples hematomas, una brecha en la cabeza, pérdida de varios dientes y la pérdida total de visión en un ojo, causada presuntamente por una paliza. La desaparición de la víctima había sido denunciada en abril de 2024.

La denuncia se basa en testimonios de personas trabajadoras del centro, contratadas como fijas discontinuas y con jornadas parciales del 58%, que trasladaron su situación al sindicato a finales de 2025.

Entre las prácticas denunciadas destaca la obligación de compensar días de vacaciones trabajando en fiestas de cumpleaños organizadas por la propia academia los fines de semana. En estas celebraciones, el personal contratado como profesorado de inglés afirma que debía realizar tareas ajenas a su categoría profesional, como servir bebidas, incluido alcohol, a los padres del alumnado.

La reciente sentencia aclara que la inscripción de la operación en el Registro de la Propiedad no sustituye la obligación de notificar directamente al inquilino, y que el plazo de retracto solo comienza cuando el arrendatario tiene conocimiento completo de la venta. El caso que motivó la resolución involucró a un fondo que compró un paquete de 19 viviendas a un banco sin informar a los arrendatarios, argumentando que la publicidad registral era suficiente.

Datos recientes muestran que Madrid y Barcelona son de las ciudades europeas más inaccesibles para quienes dependen de un salario. En promedio, una persona debe destinar el 74% de su sueldo mensual para pagar un alquiler, lo que limita gravemente la capacidad de cubrir otros gastos básicos. En la última década, los precios de la vivienda han subido un 72%, mientras que los salarios apenas lo han hecho en un 22,7%. Esto obliga a muchos jóvenes a compartir piso con varias personas, reduciendo la expectativa de independencia y vivienda en propiedad a un objetivo prácticamente inalcanzable. La edad media de emancipación en España es de 30 años, superior a la media europea de 26, debido a la disparidad entre ingresos y costes de vivienda. Con un salario medio juvenil de 1.170 euros al mes, independizarse en solitario resulta casi imposible.

Fesser subraya que de los 400.000 detenidos por el ICE, únicamente el 14% tiene antecedentes penales, desmintiendo la idea de que se están arrestando a los criminales más peligrosos del país.

Según un informe reciente del portal inmobiliario Idealista, el 68% de los alquileres disponibles exige a los hogares destinar más del 30% de sus ingresos, el umbral que los expertos consideran saludable para el gasto en vivienda. De hecho, alquilar absorbe de media el 38% de los ingresos familiares, frente al 26% que supone una hipoteca.

El esfuerzo para alquilar supera en 12 puntos al necesario para comprar una vivienda y en al menos 12 capitales de provincia el alquiler rebasa claramente ese límite recomendado. El problema se agrava por la fuerte subida de precios registrada en los últimos cinco años: según pisos.com, el alquiler ha aumentado un 46% de media en España desde 2021, con incrementos de hasta el 80% en comunidades como Madrid, Baleares o Cataluña.

La causa se centra en la difusión en redes sociales de datos concretos sobre la localización de su domicilio, hechos que la querellante considera constitutivos de delitos contra la intimidad personal y familiar, así como de hostigamiento y acoso.

Según la documentación judicial conocida, las diligencias se abrieron en mayo del año pasado, aunque la declaración se ha retrasado por dificultades para localizar a Quiles y notificarle formalmente.

El documento, que parecía titularse 'Jayapal Pramila Search History', indicaría que el Departamento de Justicia rastrea qué documentos consultan los legisladores y cuándo. Esto provocó críticas incluso dentro del Partido Republicano, con figuras como Nancy Mace calificando el seguimiento de 'espeluznante' y señalando que se están registrando todas las acciones sobre los archivos, incluyendo marcas de tiempo. Jayapal denunció la situación como 'indignante' y aseguró que buscará frenar el presunto espionaje a miembros del Congreso. La tensión entre Bondi y los legisladores demócratas, así como algunas críticas internas republicanas, subrayan los temores de que los documentos puedan ser utilizados]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pam-bondi-vista-con-documento-que-indicaria-seguimiento-del-acceso-de-legisladores-a-archivos-de-epstein</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pam-bondi-vista-con-documento-que-indicaria-seguimiento-del-acceso-de-legisladores-a-archivos-de-epstein</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo británico declara ilegal la prohibición de Palestine Action por vulnerar derechos fundamentales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo del Reino Unido ha dictaminado que la decisión del Gobierno británico de ilegalizar al grupo activista propalestino Palestine Action fue contraria a la ley. El fallo supone un duro revés para el Ejecutivo encabezado por Keir Starmer, al considerar que la prohibición constituyó una interferencia desproporcionada en los derechos a la libertad de expresión y de reunión. No obstante, la ilegalización se mantendrá de forma provisional hasta una nueva vista prevista para el 20 de febrero, en la que las partes presentarán sus alegaciones antes de una decisión definitiva.

Palestine Action fue designada como organización terrorista en julio de 2025, tras una serie de acciones directas contra empresas de armamento vinculadas a Israel y contra instalaciones militares británicas. Entre estas protestas se incluyeron bloqueos de accesos, infiltraciones en bases militares y daños materiales, como pintadas y destrozos en aviones de la Fuerza Aérea en la base de Brize Norton.

El texto también señala que Feijóo estaría alineado con la facción más ultraderechista del PP y respaldado por figuras como Aznar y Ayuso, así como por medios y periodistas afines. Se le acusa de fomentar la crispación, utilizar a las víctimas con fines políticos y de no estar preparado para liderar el país debido a su falta de madurez política y empatía. Además, se critica su apoyo a políticos locales cuya gestión habría provocado muertes, sugiriendo incluso posibles responsabilidades legales no asumidas.

Este paso se considera estratégico para cubrir la brecha de capacidad mientras se desarrollan proyectos nacionales como el Tejas Mark 1A y el futuro avión de combate de quinta generación.

Según el reportaje, estas armas —conocidas también como bombas de vacío o aerosol— pueden generar temperaturas superiores a los 3.500 grados centígrados, suficientes para calcinar tejidos humanos hasta hacerlos irreconocibles.

A pesar de su amplia aceptación en el ámbito meteorológico, esta palabra no ha sido reconocida oficialmente por la Real Academia Española, a pesar de los esfuerzos por incorporarla. El 'engelamiento' se produce cuando gotas de agua líquida a temperaturas inferiores a 0°C impactan sobre la aeronave, congelándose al instante y formando una capa de hielo. Este fenómeno puede degradar las capacidades aerodinámicas del avión y poner en riesgo la seguridad del vuelo. La historia del término se remonta a los años 30, cuando los pioneros en meteorología aeronáutica en España propusieron la palabra para describir este fenómeno.

Tras episodios anteriores en los que otros miembros de su partido, como José Manuel Mariscal, sugerían entrar al ente público con motosierra o lanzallamas, Figaredo ha elevado la retórica al mencionar la bomba atómica como supuesta forma de acceder a la corporación. Durante sus intervenciones, el diputado ha acusado a RTVE de manipulación mediática, desprecio hacia los españoles y de favorecer a ciertos presentadores y tertulianos mientras ignora los problemas cotidianos de la ciudadanía. Figaredo ha citado nombres concretos como Javier Ruiz, Jesús Cintora y Silvia Intxaurrondo, asegurando que se lucran y se burlan de quienes critican al Gobierno.

Solís es diplomada en Enfermería desde 2008 y ha desarrollado su carrera en el SES, incluyendo labores como enfermera quirúrgica. Su participación genera polémica porque el tribunal evaluador ha sido nombrado por su jefe directo, Jesús Vilés, director gerente del SES, lo que plantea un dilema ético sobre la transparencia del proceso. Profesionales sanitarios de la zona han expresado su malestar y cuestionan la imparcialidad. Aunque el derecho de Solís a presentarse está fuera de toda duda, expertos y sindicatos destacan la falta de ejemplaridad en este caso, dado que combina funciones políticas y de gestión con la aspiración de obtener una plaza fija en el turno libre.

Así lo manifestaron los consejeros delegados de ambas compañías, José Bogas y Mario Ruiz-Tagle, durante su comparecencia en la comisión de investigación abierta en el Senado.

Según Endesa, desde primera hora de la mañana ya existían señales claras de inestabilidad en la red, que fueron comunicadas al operador del sistema antes de las once. No obstante, la empresa sostiene que REE no otorgó la relevancia necesaria a esos avisos. Posteriormente se produjeron dos oscilaciones de frecuencia inesperadas, una en una planta fotovoltaica de Badajoz y otra en la interconexión con Francia.

Sin embargo, este crecimiento no se debe a un repunte de la natalidad dentro del país, sino al aumento de ciudadanos españoles nacidos en el extranjero y a la inmigración. Durante el último trimestre de 2025, la población nacida en España se redujo en casi 18.700 personas, reflejando una crisis de natalidad persistente y el avance del envejecimiento demográfico.

En contraste, el número de españoles nacidos fuera de España aumentó en más de 100.000 personas en solo tres meses, superando por primera vez la cifra de 10 millones. Este fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al principio de ius sanguinis y a los procesos de adquisición de la nacionalidad española, que explican que el crecimiento de españoles nacidos en el extranjero sea incluso superior al de residentes con nacionalidad extranjera.

Los científicos señalan que las incertidumbres en los modelos climáticos impiden predecir con precisión cuándo se alcanzarán estos puntos de inflexión, que incluyen el derretimiento de la capa de hielo de Groenlandia, la descongelación del permafrost y la pérdida de la selva amazónica. La interacción entre estos elementos puede generar bucles de retroalimentación que amplifiquen el calentamiento, como la disminución de la reflexión solar por el hielo derretido o el debilitamiento de la circulación oceánica del Atlántico, afectando ecosistemas clave.

La iniciativa, impulsada originalmente por Junts, modifica el Código Penal para permitir condenas de hasta tres años de prisión a quienes cometan hurtos de forma reiterada, incluso cuando el valor total de lo sustraído no supere los 400 euros, así como cuando el objeto robado sea un teléfono móvil u otro dispositivo electrónico.

La norma también introduce cambios en la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal para permitir que los ayuntamientos ejerzan la acción penal cuando la Fiscalía no actúe. Además, a través de enmiendas pactadas entre PSOE, PP y Junts, el endurecimiento de las penas se extiende a la multirreincidencia en delitos de estafa y se incorpora al Código Penal el delito de aprovisionamiento de combustible a embarcaciones utilizadas por narcotraficantes, conocido como petaqueo.

En ese periodo, entre 500.000 y un millón de personas de origen mexicano fueron obligadas o presionadas a abandonar el país, aunque algunas estimaciones elevan la cifra hasta los dos millones. Lo más grave es que entre el 40% y el 60% de los afectados eran ciudadanos estadounidenses, en su mayoría menores nacidos en Estados Unidos.

Aunque el Gobierno federal respaldó estas políticas, la iniciativa partió principalmente de autoridades estatales y locales, con el apoyo de organizaciones privadas. Las deportaciones formales fueron menores que las salidas “voluntarias”, pero estas últimas estuvieron marcadas por la coacción, la desinformación y el miedo. Las redadas se concentraron especialmente entre 1930 y 1933, bajo la presidencia de Herbert Hoover, y alcanzaron su punto álgido en 1931.

Tras identificar el marcador con un número de contacto, los pescadores avisaron a los investigadores, documentaron la captura y devolvieron el pez al agua, evidenciando el alto grado de implicación del sector pesquero local.

Históricamente, el esturión fue una especie común en numerosos ríos españoles, pero la construcción de presas y azudes que interrumpieron su migración reproductiva, junto con la sobreexplotación pesquera, provocaron su desaparición progresiva a lo largo del siglo XX.

Si el sismo es de una magnitud considerable, el teléfono envía un aviso a los usuarios con anticipación, en este caso alrededor de un minuto antes. La alerta fue recibida por muchos usuarios que destacaron la efectividad del sistema, el cual también permite configurar la activación de las alertas en el dispositivo.

La zona a urbanizar alberga especies protegidas como el azufaifo, un arbusto considerado prioritario en Europa. La Asociación Amigos del Parque Natural Cabo de Gata-Níjar ha denunciado el impacto ambiental de este proyecto, que afecta a hábitats de interés comunitario. PACMA también ha presentado una denuncia ante SEPRONA por el delito ambiental que supone la destrucción de ejemplares de azufaifo. Las obras se realizan en un espacio declarado Reserva de la Biosfera por la UNESCO y con protecciones de la Red Natura 2000. A pesar de la oposición de colectivos ecologistas y vecinos, la Consejería de Medio Ambiente de Andalucía defiende que la urbanización cumple con la normativa ambiental vigente, aunque no se establecieron condicionantes ambientales para el proyecto.

La investigación comenzó a raíz de una denuncia presentada por los grupos PSOE y Hacemos Córdoba. Aunque no se ha podido identificar al autor del mensaje, la Fiscalía considera que el contenido es suficientemente grave como para iniciar acciones legales. El artículo 510 del Código Penal, que castiga los delitos de odio por motivos racistas o xenófobos, es el fundamento de la denuncia.

Sin embargo, esta transacción estuvo rodeada de controversia, ya que el territorio pertenecía a España en ese momento. La historia remonta a 1762, cuando Luisiana fue cedida a España. Aunque en 1800, por medio del Tratado de San Ildefonso, España devolvió el territorio a Francia, este acuerdo prohibía a Napoleón venderlo a terceros, algo que él ignoró. En 1803, Napoleón vendió Luisiana a los Estados Unidos, a pesar de que España aún controlaba muchas áreas del territorio. Las banderas españolas seguían ondeando y los administradores del territorio seguían siendo españoles, lo que llevó a España a protestar ante la venta, pero sin capacidad para enfrentar a Napoleón. Este episodio ha sido catalogado como uno de los mayores fraudes inmobiliarios de la historia, ya que se vendió un territorio que, en realidad, no pertenecía a Francia en el momento de la transacción.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fraude-inmobiliario-de-la-venta-de-luisiana-la-historia-de-como-francia-engano-a-eeuu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fraude-inmobiliario-de-la-venta-de-luisiana-la-historia-de-como-francia-engano-a-eeuu</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 23:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP aprueba una ley que otorga voto a las universidades privadas en el sistema académico andaluz]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Parlamento andaluz ha aprobado la nueva Ley Universitaria para Andalucía (LUPA), con el apoyo exclusivo del PP y el rechazo unánime de la oposición.

En 2021, un piso de 90 metros cuadrados costaba alrededor de 884 euros al mes, mientras que hoy esa misma vivienda alcanza los 1.291 euros. La Comunidad de Madrid lidera este incremento, con un aumento del 80%, alcanzando los 1.963 euros mensuales. Este encarecimiento se debe a factores como la escasez de oferta, la creciente demanda, el auge del alquiler turístico y el alquiler por habitaciones, que han hecho que muchas personas con salarios similares a los de hace cinco años tengan que pagar hasta un 50% más por sus viviendas. Otras regiones como Baleares y Cataluña también registran incrementos significativos.

A pesar de haber implementado el protocolo ActivityPub y la compatibilidad con Mastodon, la federación ha generado un aumento significativo en el tráfico, la carga de trabajo y los costes de servidor. La decisión, que no implica un rechazo al Fediverso, se toma para priorizar la estabilidad del proyecto, los costes controlados y la simplicidad operativa. A pesar de ello, Killbait no descarta volver al Fediverso en el futuro si puede mejorar su infraestructura. Mientras tanto, han lanzado un canal en Telegram para mantener a la comunidad informada y permitir interacciones más directas.

Casals ha sido históricamente conocido por su mediación entre el poder político, especialmente con el Partido Popular, y las grandes corporaciones. Su posición en Quirón Salud se produce en un contexto donde la privatización de la sanidad y las relaciones entre la política y los grandes medios de comunicación son puntos críticos de debate en España.

Según Pappé, el sionismo ha creado la falacia de que Israel es una democracia, cuando en realidad discrimina a los palestinos y niega sus derechos fundamentales. Además, Pappé predice el colapso interno de Israel, similar a lo ocurrido con el apartheid en Sudáfrica, y aboga por una descolonización pacífica del país. Considera que las tensiones internas entre el 'Estado de Judea' y el 'Estado de Israel' podrían llevar a la desaparición del Estado actual, dejando paso a nuevas oportunidades para la paz en la región. En este sentido, el historiador apuesta por un futuro en el que el pueblo palestino pueda ocupar un rol fundamental en la construcción de una nueva estructura política y cultural más inclusiva y justa, y en el que la diáspora judía, sobre todo en Estados Unidos, pueda tener un papel importante en este proce]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ilan-pappe-sobre-el-sionismo-y-el-futuro-de-israel-una-critica-al-regimen-y-la-descolonizacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ilan-pappe-sobre-el-sionismo-y-el-futuro-de-israel-una-critica-al-regimen-y-la-descolonizacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Congresista denuncia seguimiento del Departamento de Justicia durante revisión de archivos de Epstein]]></title><description><![CDATA[La congresista demócrata Pramila Jayapal ha acusado al Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) de realizar un seguimiento de su historial de búsquedas mientras revisaba archivos sin censura relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein.

Desde 1915, el ejército alemán fue pionero en el uso de gas venenoso, un arma letal que pronto se extendió a todos los bandos. El gas cloro, fosgeno y mostaza fueron los principales agentes empleados, causando una gran cantidad de muertes y lesiones graves. El primer ataque significativo con gas tuvo lugar en la Segunda Batalla de Ypres, donde 168 toneladas de gas de cloro causaron la muerte de miles de soldados aliados. A pesar de su alta mortalidad, el gas no fue determinante en términos estratégicos debido a factores como el viento y las defensas con máscaras antigás. Sin embargo, su efecto psicológico fue devastador, creando un temor constante entre los combatientes. Aunque la guerra química dejó un millón de víctimas y los esfuerzos posteriores intentaron prohibir su uso, el gas venenoso sigue apareciendo en algunos conflictos bélicos act]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-gas-venenoso-en-la-primera-guerra-mundial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-gas-venenoso-en-la-primera-guerra-mundial</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 20:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Agresión racista a un joven senegalés en Camas, Sevilla]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un joven senegalés fue atacado el pasado fin de semana en Camas (Sevilla) por tres encapuchados, quienes lo golpearon y apuñalaron mientras le proferían insultos racistas.

El presupuesto asignado a la Casa Real se mantiene en 8,4 millones de euros, una cifra que abarca retribuciones, servicios sociales y gastos de funcionamiento, incluidos suministros, viajes y protocolo. La subida también afecta a altos cargos como Camilo Villarino, jefe de la Casa del Rey, que recibirá 178.915 euros.

La discusión toma como ejemplo figuras como Epstein, quienes ejercen su poder de manera arbitraria y deshumanizada. El texto aborda la desconexión entre las grandes fortunas y las cualidades personales de quienes las gestionan, destacando los efectos morales devastadores que genera este poder, tanto en quienes lo ejercen como en la sociedad en su conjunto. Además, se explora la tendencia a la perversión moral que surge en individuos con poder absoluto, especialmente cuando buscan el placer por sí mismo, sin propósito ni significado. En el análisis, se menciona el impacto histórico de la filosofía del Marqués de Sade, quien promovió una visión del ser humano como máquina al servicio del placer.

Estas obras fueron 'perdidas' tras la disolución de la Sociedad Española de Amigos del Arte a principios de los años 80, y, de acuerdo con la información oficial, se encontraban depositadas en el Palacio desde 1973. Sin embargo, lo que parecía un misterio se resolvió de manera algo sospechosa, con una actitud de pasividad tanto de la Casa de Alba como de los medios. La Casa de Alba admitió que además del cuadro de Sorolla, había otras dos obras robadas. Lo que se ha considerado una colaboración, en otros contextos podría haber sido motivo suficiente para un registro exhaustivo y un interrogatorio más profundo.

Sin embargo, la defensa cuestionó la credibilidad de la denuncia, señalando que no existían pruebas médicas ni testimonios que corroboraran los hechos. El tribunal subrayó que, debido a la falta de pruebas concluyentes, el joven fue absuelto y eximido de toda responsabilidad civil.

A lo largo de la entrevista, Ferré también comenta sobre la influencia de la Transición en su obra, especialmente en su última novela, *Todas las hijas de la casa de mi padre*.

Entre las acciones realizadas, Shears colocó artículos favorables sobre Epstein en medios de prestigio, como Forbes y Huffington Post, para que se posicionaran más alto en los resultados de búsqueda.

Tras la final entre los Seattle Seahawks y los New England Patriots, cerca de 1.000 jets privados despegaron de los aeropuertos del Área de la Bahía. La web especializada Flightradar informó de un incremento del 1136% en las salidas de aviones privados en comparación con el domingo anterior. Entre los aviones más destacados estuvo el Gulfstream G650 de Kim Kardashian, y el Bombardier Global 7500 de Jay-Z y Beyoncé. Además, los aeropuertos cercanos como el de San José fueron escenario de una saturación inusual, con plazas de aparcamiento para jets privados que costaban entre 3.000 y 40.000 dólares. La locura se desató poco después de que los Seahawks ganaran el partido por 29-13, reflejando la magnitud del evento y el lujo asociado a los asistentes más exclusivos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-de-jets-privados-tras-la-super-bowl-2026-mas-de-1-000-vuelos-en-pocas-horas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-de-jets-privados-tras-la-super-bowl-2026-mas-de-1-000-vuelos-en-pocas-horas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP de Algeciras se burla de una edil del PSOE mientras se discutía un homenaje a las víctimas del nazismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En un tenso pleno del Ayuntamiento de Algeciras, el presidente del PP local, Jacinto Muñoz, hizo una burla en tono irónico hacia la edil socialista Rocío Arrabal mientras ella defendía una moción para rendir homenaje a los algecireños deportados a los campos de concentración nazis. El hecho ocurrió en presencia de la familia de uno de los deportados, Andrés Sánchez, cuya historia de sufrimiento durante el Holocausto fue rememorada en el pleno. La actitud del edil del PP ha sido condenada por colectivos memorialistas y la Federación Andaluza de Memoria Democrática, que exigen una disculpa pública. Esta burla tuvo lugar justo días después de la conmemoración del Día Internacional en Memoria de las Víctimas del Holocausto. La portavoz socialista denunció el comportamiento como antidemocrático y exigió una rectificación inmediata, mientras que los asistentes al pleno vivieron un ambiente de violencia verbal.

Estas decisiones, anunciadas por el ministro de Finanzas israelí Bezalel Smotrich, permiten a los colonos judíos un mayor control sobre las tierras palestinas, lo que se considera un ataque a la idea de un Estado palestino independiente. Entre las medidas se destacan la eliminación de restricciones sobre la venta de tierras a judíos y la creación de nuevos procedimientos para la planificación y legalización de asentamientos. La comunidad internacional, incluyendo al Reino Unido, ha expresado su rechazo, considerando que las acciones israelíes violan el derecho internacional y fomentan la violencia en la región.

La oposición acusó al Gobierno regional y al PP de proteger al regidor, que continúa en su cargo, y de intentar ocultar o minimizar la denuncia, que fue archivada tanto por el PP de Madrid como por el nacional sin una investigación adecuada. Manuela Bergerot (Más Madrid) señaló a Ayuso como responsable de que Bautista no dimitiera y criticó duramente al secretario general del PP madrileño, Alfonso Serrano, por sus comentarios despectivos sobre el caso.

Su llegada al Tour de Francia coincidió con el caso Festina, una experiencia que transformó lo que debía ser un sueño en una etapa marcada por la sospecha y el descrédito. Voigt explica el impacto personal y familiar de competir bajo una duda constante, incluso para quienes no formaron parte de prácticas ilícitas.

Durante años ejerció como una voz incómoda dentro del pelotón, defendiendo la necesidad de hablar abiertamente del dopaje. Esa posición le situó en medio de un ciclismo dividido entre quienes pedían silencio y quienes exigían mayor contundencia.

Además, se le entregó la medalla a Trump debido al 250 aniversario de la independencia de Estados Unidos, en un contexto marcado por la influencia del movimiento MAGA. Estas decisiones han sido criticadas por la oposición y otros sectores sociales, quienes ven en estas acciones un intento de acercamiento a movimientos fascistas y autoritarios.

El tribunal desestimó la apelación de la Fiscalía, que había solicitado una condena por delito de odio. La sentencia subraya que el motivo de la agresión fue la forma de vestir del joven, no su orientación sexual. La Fiscalía considera la decisión arbitraria y recurrirá ante el Tribunal Supremo, aunque por el momento, la absolución parece definitiva.

A pesar de las amenazas del presidente a los legisladores republicanos que votaron en contra de los aranceles, el voto final fue de 219 a 211. Esta decisión marca un raro desafío bipartidista a la Casa Blanca, aunque la medida tiene un carácter simbólico, ya que cualquier cambio real en la política de aranceles dependería de la firma de Trump, quien ya ha advertido sobre las consecuencias políticas de contradecirlo.

Este cambio ha generado incertidumbre, dado que Gallup ha sido una de las principales fuentes de datos sobre la percepción pública de los mandatarios. La decisión responde a cambios en la metodología y a la dificultad de obtener muestras representativas. Aunque Gallup continuará realizando otros tipos de encuestas, esta interrupción marca un punto de inflexión en el análisis político del país. Expertos en sondeos políticos se han mostrado sorprendidos y algunos sugieren que el cambio puede reflejar una evolución en las tendencias de consumo de datos en la era digital, donde las encuestas tradicionales han perdido algo de relevancia. El impacto de esta decisión sobre futuras elecciones y sobre la credibilidad de otros medios de encuestas sigue siendo incierto.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gallup-suspende-las-encuestas-sobre-la-aprobacion-presidencial-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gallup-suspende-las-encuestas-sobre-la-aprobacion-presidencial-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Despido disciplinario por fraude en RENFE: el caso de Macarena]]></title><description><![CDATA[Macarena trabajaba en RENFE con más de diez años de antigüedad y un salario anual cercano a los 40.000€, pero su intento de fraude la llevó al despido.

A pesar de que confesó el fraude tras ser descubierta, su despido fue ratificado por el Tribunal Superior de Justicia tras un recurso fallido.

La docente de Castellano realizó la solicitud en valenciano, a lo que el gerente respondió de manera tajante exigiendo que se usara exclusivamente castellano o inglés.

Durante más de 26 años, miles de trabajadores migrantes han estado viviendo en condiciones deplorables en asentamientos chabolistas, sin acceso a servicios básicos como electricidad o agua corriente. La mayoría de estos trabajadores son migrantes irregulares que enfrentan explotación laboral y social, muchos de ellos pagando altas sumas por conseguir trabajo o un contrato. A pesar de las denuncias internacionales y de algunas medidas como el Plan Integral para la Erradicación del Chabolismo, la situación sigue sin cambiar. En 2024, la Inspección de Trabajo registró más de mil infracciones en el sector, y los salarios son inferiores al mínimo legal.

Este sistema permitía a las empresas pagar parte del salario con vales alimentarios, que no se computaban para aportes previsionales ni otros beneficios laborales. La propuesta está incluida en el borrador de la Reforma Laboral, que busca modernizar el esquema con la finalidad de incentivar la formalización laboral y reducir la carga impositiva de las empresas. Sin embargo, los sindicatos advierten sobre los riesgos de precarización que esto podría conllevar, como la fragmentación salarial y la afectación de derechos como la antigüedad, las indemnizaciones y los aportes jubilatorios.

Durante la Guerra Fría, la aviación de combate estadounidense buscaba contrarrestar la amenaza de los misiles soviéticos, y para ello necesitaba desarrollar aviones capaces de evitar la detección por radar. En 1974, el proyecto ‘Have Blue’ fue lanzado con el objetivo de crear un caza que priorizara la invisibilidad en lugar de la velocidad. Los ingenieros de Lockheed descubrieron un trabajo de Ufimtsev sobre cómo las ondas electromagnéticas se dispersan en superficies angulares, lo que llevó a la creación de un avión con un diseño que minimizaba la firma radar. El F-117, a pesar de ser subsonico y no contar con superficies curvadas, marcó el comienzo de una nueva era en la aviación militar. Este caza fue un éxito rotundo en misiones como la Guerra del Golfo, Kosovo y la guerra de Irak, aunque su existencia se mantuvo en secreto durante varios año]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-las-investigaciones-de-un-fisico-sovietico-en-el-desarrollo-del-primer-avion-sigiloso-estadounidense</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-las-investigaciones-de-un-fisico-sovietico-en-el-desarrollo-del-primer-avion-sigiloso-estadounidense</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España alcanza niveles récord de energía almacenada en embalses]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Península Ibérica ha registrado un aumento histórico en la energía almacenada en sus embalses gracias a las lluvias intensas de las últimas semanas.

Este estudio, basado en fuentes clásicas y hallazgos arqueológicos, explora cómo este gesto sirvió tanto para sellar pactos de amistad como para representar castigos y trofeos de guerra. La mano derecha era un símbolo de hospitalidad y unión, utilizado en ceremonias de concordia, como los pactos entre los celtíberos y los romanos. Las téseras de hospitalidad, piezas de bronce en forma de manos entrelazadas, evidencian estos acuerdos. Sin embargo, la mano también simbolizaba la mutilación y el castigo en la guerra. La práctica de amputar manos de los enemigos como trofeo era común, aunque el estudio matiza que a menudo fue exagerada en los relatos romanos.

Entre las propuestas clave se incluyen la extensión de la jornada laboral hasta 12 horas, la eliminación de indemnizaciones por despido y una reducción de los derechos a huelga, al imponer servicios mínimos en sectores esenciales. Además, el proyecto permite el pago de salarios en especie y la creación de un Fondo de Asistencia Laboral financiado por los empresarios. Las centrales sindicales, como la CGT, se oponen firmemente, advirtiendo que la reforma debilita los derechos laborales y la negociación colectiva. Aunque el gobierno justifica la reforma como una forma de flexibilizar el mercado laboral y fomentar el empleo registrado, sus detractores señalan que, en realidad, precariza las condiciones de los trabajadores y favorece a los empleadores.

Estos archivos, que supuestamente vinculan al presidente Donald Trump con posibles delitos relacionados con Epstein, han generado controversia. Lieu sostiene que Bondi ocultó información clave y manipuló los hechos en su testimonio para proteger a Trump, a quien se le ha relacionado con el magnate condenado por tráfico sexual. El caso ha resurgido en un contexto en el que la administración Trump sigue enfrentando diversas investigaciones. La acusación se produce en medio de un creciente debate sobre el manejo de estos documentos y la falta de claridad sobre las conexiones entre figuras políticas de alto perfil y el caso Epstein.

A través de incentivos y fondos públicos, el Gobierno quiere fomentar que los empleados tomen las riendas de las empresas ante la jubilación de los propietarios. Además, se busca evitar que estas empresas sean adquiridas por fondos de inversión. La ley también propondría beneficios fiscales para las empresas que implementen estos planes y sanciones para las que no lo hagan.

En su crítica, destaca cómo figuras del Partido Popular (PP) y otros sectores de la derecha imitan a Vox, adoptando posturas cada vez más extremas y provocadoras. Ramos señala que la hipocresía de la derecha se hace evidente en su defensa de causas como la protección de la infancia mientras callan ante los abusos de figuras poderosas, como Jeffrey Epstein. Además, critica cómo estas actitudes son normalizadas y cómo los partidos políticos tradicionales, como el PP, terminan cediendo ante las políticas de la extrema derecha, lo que lleva a la pérdida de su propio centro y moderación. Este fenómeno se refleja también en un aumento de actitudes xenófobas, machistas y racistas, con la intención de recuperar el poder a toda costa.

Aunque la ley de dependencia, instaurada en 2006, permitió avances significativos en el acceso a prestaciones, persisten problemas como las listas de espera desiguales entre comunidades, la dependencia del cuidado informal y la falta de evaluación de la calidad asistencial.

Esta sugerencia se presenta como una alternativa a imponer aranceles directos del 30% a China, lo cual podría generar conflictos políticos dentro de la UE. Según los expertos, China tiene una ventaja competitiva debido a su moneda subvaluada y su industria subsidiada, lo que ha permitido al país aumentar su cuota de mercado a expensas de la industria europea. La devaluación del euro se considera una opción más sencilla que los aranceles, pero podría tener implicaciones en la competitividad de la UE a nivel global. China ya ha advertido que imponer estos aranceles sería una declaración de guerra comercial.

La investigación, desarrollada por la Guardia Civil en el marco de la operación ‘URGI 26 ROLO’, describe un patrón reiterado de engaño, planificación y agresión con un marcado componente de odio.

Según el auto judicial, el principal investigado empleaba un perfil falso en la aplicación, con fotografías sustraídas a un tercero, para generar confianza y concertar encuentros.

La defensora del movimiento MAGA se mostró indignada por el hecho de que el artista puertorriqueño cantara en español, argumentando que el espectáculo debía ser un evento unificador para todo el país, no solo para la comunidad latina. Su postura desató un intenso debate sobre la relación entre inmigración, cultura y el significado de eventos de gran trascendencia nacional como el Super Bowl. Kelly defendió que el espectáculo debería haber sido más representativo de la cultura estadounidense, subrayando su rechazo a la inclusión del español en este tipo de eventos.

Este enclave había sido empleado de forma intermitente durante unos 700 años, pese a que las poblaciones de bisontes seguían siendo abundantes en la región cuando el lugar fue finalmente abandonado.

El equipo de investigación, liderado por el paleoecólogo John Wendt, combinó excavaciones arqueológicas, análisis de sedimentos, estudios de polen y carbón vegetal, y reconstrucciones climáticas para comprender qué motivó el cese de la actividad humana en la zona. Los resultados descartan que el abandono se debiera a una desaparición de los bisontes, a cambios significativos en la vegetación o a una alteración relevante en los regímenes de incendios.

La clave estuvo en el clima.

Esta avispa deposita sus huevos en el interior de las larvas de la polilla de la col (Plutella xylostella), una de las principales plagas agrícolas de cultivos como la col, el brócoli o la colza, responsable de pérdidas de miles de millones de euros a nivel mundial.

Junto a los huevos, la avispa inocula un virus integrado en su propio genoma. Este patógeno logra evadir el sistema inmunitario del hospedador y, además, interfiere de forma directa en su desarrollo reproductivo. El estudio, publicado en la revista PNAS, demuestra que uno de los genes virales codifica una enzima (PTP) que se une a la proteína Rad9A, clave en la regulación de la apoptosis o muerte celular programada.

Las empresas que no cumplan con esta legislación, que exige la divulgación de las bandas salariales y la eliminación del secreto salarial, no podrán acceder a contratos públicos. Esto podría ser un golpe importante para las empresas que no logren adaptarse a los requisitos, ya que los Estados miembros de la UE deberán implementar sanciones contra las empresas infractoras.

Entre ellos destaca Antonio Burgueño, exasesor sanitario de Isabel Díaz Ayuso y principal responsable del diseño del denominado Plan de Choque frente a la pandemia. Dicho plan incluía como medida central la medicalización de las residencias, una actuación que finalmente no se llevó a cabo de forma efectiva.

El Juzgado de Instrucción número 2 de Collado Villalba ha citado a Burgueño en calidad de investigado, después de dos intentos fallidos previos en otros juzgados.

El eje central es la tesis de que el PSOE fue reconstruido en los años setenta con el apoyo y la influencia de servicios de inteligencia occidentales, especialmente la CIA estadounidense y la socialdemocracia alemana, con el objetivo de frenar el avance del Partido Comunista tras la muerte de Franco.

El artículo sitúa como punto clave el Congreso de Suresnes de 1974, donde Felipe González, bajo el nombre de “Isidoro”, accede a la secretaría general del partido. Se describe cómo sectores del franquismo tardío y del SECED facilitaron pasaportes, contactos y una cierta tolerancia policial hacia los socialistas del interior, mientras la represión se concentraba en los comunistas.

La resolución revoca una querella que acusaba a Cerdán de mentir en su declaración, en la que aseguró haber tenido escaso contacto con Koldo García.

A través de fuentes como Homero, Hesíodo o Heródoto, se explica que los escenarios mitológicos se sitúan en un territorio ambiguo, a medio camino entre lo real y lo imaginario, donde la precisión geográfica carece de importancia frente al valor simbólico del relato.

La geografía mitológica se caracteriza por la idealización, el aislamiento y la anacronía. Los lugares donde transcurren los mitos suelen aparecer como espacios lejanos, inaccesibles o peligrosos, pero también como paraísos o territorios “dorados”, cargados de riqueza y maravilla. Estos espacios existen únicamente para que el mito tenga lugar y no están sometidos a las leyes normales del tiempo ni del clima, lo que explica fenómenos como la luz perpetua, la noche eterna o la ause]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia plantea eliminar las últimas paradas de venta directa de los agricultores de la Huerta]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia ha anunciado su intención de modificar la Ordenanza de Mercados, incluyendo como primera medida el cierre de las últimas paradas de venta directa conocidas como la 'Tira de Comptar'. Esta figura tiene un origen medieval, consolidado por Jaume I, que permitía a los agricultores de la Huerta vender sus productos frescos directamente en la ciudad. Ni siquiera las prohibiciones de Felip V lograron eliminar esta tradición, que hoy se mantiene en muy pocas paradas, principalmente en el Mercat del Cabanyal y el de Mossén Sorell. Según el equipo municipal, la nueva ordenanza busca revitalizar los mercados municipales, argumentando que estas paradas generan competencia desleal. Sin embargo, colectivos como Per l’Horta consideran que la acusación es infundada y que estas paradas, aunque simbólicas, son procompetitivas y ofrecen productos frescos cultivados por los propios agricultores, a diferencia de otras verdulerías que revenden productos de mayoristas.

En concreto, ha contrapuesto la actuación del ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, tras el accidente ferroviario de Adamuz, con la del president de la Generalitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón, durante la reciente dana que afectó a su comunidad.

Rufián ha subrayado que Puente compareció públicamente pocas horas después del accidente para dar explicaciones, mientras que Mazón, según sus palabras, permaneció ausente durante varias horas clave en plena emergencia, llegando a ironizar con que estaba “tomándose la tercera copa”. Para el dirigente republicano, ambos comportamientos no son comparables y desmontan las críticas del PP a la gestión del Gobierno central.

El informe indica que este descenso continuado sitúa a España por detrás de países como Ruanda o Arabia Saudí, que normalmente se consideran regímenes menos democráticos, y solo ligeramente por encima de otros países con niveles similares de puntuación. La tendencia negativa se ha mantenido durante varios años, reflejando una percepción creciente de prácticas corruptas y una erosión de la confianza en las instituciones.

El aviso a la policía se produjo alrededor de las tres de la madrugada, alertando de una pelea violenta entre dos compañeras de piso en un domicilio de la calle Cartagena, cerca del Hospital de Sant Pau.

Cuando los agentes llegaron al lugar, encontraron a dos mujeres de 29 y 30 años, de nacionalidad hondureña y peruana, ambas con múltiples lesiones visibles. Una de ellas presentaba heridas especialmente graves, entre ellas la pérdida parcial de una oreja, además de mordeduras repartidas por diversas partes del cuerpo.

La trabajadora, con un salario mensual superior a 3.000 euros, utilizaba tanto su acceso como claves de otros compañeros para procesar devoluciones de manera fraudulenta, acumulando cerca de 2.000 euros de manera irregular. La auditoría interna detectó un patrón de operaciones sospechosas: devoluciones múltiples en fechas concretas sin solicitud real de los viajeros. La sentencia del TSJA ratifica que estas acciones constituyen un incumplimiento grave de la buena fe contractual y justifican el despido disciplinario.

Esta norma se inserta en el contexto del Reglamento Europeo de Inteligencia Artificial y del proceso de digitalización de la justicia impulsado por la normativa estatal reciente, fijando principios, límites y responsabilidades claras para jueces y magistrados.

La Instrucción parte de una idea central: la IA solo puede ser un instrumento de apoyo y nunca sustituir al juez en la toma de decisiones. Para ello, establece principios como el control humano efectivo, la responsabilidad exclusiva del juzgador, la independencia judicial, el respeto a los derechos fundamentales, la confidencialidad de los datos y la prevención de sesgos algorítmicos.

Sin embargo, la medida más controvertida no es el precio, sino la aplicación de la cláusula de 'no renovación' para pacientes con enfermedades crónicas o de edad avanzada. Durante años, el modelo de negocio se basó en captar clientes sanos con primas bajas, pero ahora, ante el aumento del uso intensivo de la cobertura, muchas aseguradoras deciden no renovar contratos a quienes dejan de ser rentables. Además, se han endurecido los procedimientos para acceder a pruebas diagnósticas y tratamientos menores, generando retrasos que imitan las limitaciones de la sanidad pública. El resultado es un sistema de selección de riesgos que prioriza a los pacientes jóvenes y sanos, derivando al resto de facto al sistema público.

En ese momento, Rosa Belmonte hizo un comentario despectivo sobre Santaolalla, refiriéndose a ella con la frase '¿Esa que es la mitad tonta y la mitad tetas?'. El comentario generó silencio en el plató y fue aclarado posteriormente como una cita de la serie 'La Maravillosa señora Maisel'.

Aunque la República Islámica es la principal responsable de la represión, la corrupción y la mala gestión económica, las políticas de «máxima presión» de la administración Trump —incluido el abandono del JCPOA en 2018— destruyeron deliberadamente la economía iraní, empobrecieron a la clase media (millones cayeron en la pobreza entre 2011 y 2019) y sabotearon las posibilidades de un cambio pacífico o reformista desde dentro.

Durante décadas, los iraníes intentaron transformar el sistema mediante elecciones, movilizaciones y reformas, pero el fracaso del acuerdo nuclear y el endurecimiento del régimen deslegitimaron estas vías.

El examen oficial del Condado de King determinó en su momento que fue un suicidio. Sin embargo, un equipo privado de científicos forenses, liderado por Brian Burnett y la investigadora Michelle Wilkins, revisó la autopsia y el escenario del crimen. Tras tres días de análisis, el equipo concluyó que la evidencia era consistente con un homicidio. Señalaron que el daño en órganos como el cerebro y el hígado indicaba falta de oxígeno, más común en una sobredosis de heroína que en un disparo instantáneo.

El animal fue atrapado en abril de 2023 por un pescador a unas once millas náuticas entre Dénia y Jávea, cerca del Cabo de San Antonio, una zona de cañones submarinos y aguas profundas próximas a la costa. El tiburón medía alrededor de 2,1 metros y pesaba entre 80 y 90 kilos, lo que indica que se trataba de un individuo joven, muy lejos aún del tamaño adulto de esta especie.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista científica Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria, confirma que el tiburón blanco mantiene una presencia persistente pero extremadamente infrecuente en aguas españolas.

Sin embargo, al llegar a Rusia, se encontraron con contratos militares que no podían leer y amenazas de muerte si no los firmaban. Muchos compatriotas no sobrevivieron, y los supervivientes muestran cicatrices físicas y psicológicas por las experiencias en el frente, incluyendo ataques de drones y la visión de cadáveres.

El incidente se produjo a raíz de las continuas interrupciones y preguntas fuera de turno realizadas por Quiles, que, según Belarra, impidieron el normal desarrollo del acto informativo y el trabajo del resto de periodistas acreditados.

Durante la comparecencia, Belarra reprochó al agitador ultraderechista su actitud y cuestionó públicamente su independencia, afirmando que la ciudadanía tiene derecho a saber cuánto cobra y para quién trabaja. La dirigente de Podemos sostuvo que ella había respondido de forma reiterada a sus preguntas y le acusó de no dar explicaciones sobre su propia actividad, además de señalarle como alguien que, a su juicio, hace el “trabajo sucio” del Partido Popular y de Vox.

Según el informe, esta política comercial constituye el mayor aumento fiscal en Estados Unidos como porcentaje del PIB desde 1993 y está contribuyendo a agravar las preocupaciones sobre el coste de vida, afectando especialmente a productos importados como electrónica, juguetes, coches y alimentos cultivados en el extranjero. La inflación en alimentos se ha visto notablemente impactada, con subidas del 33,6% en el café, 19,3% en la carne de vacuno, 16,8% en la lechuga romana y 12,4% en el zumo de naranja congelado. La recaudación total por aranceles ascendió a 264.000 millones de dólares en 2025, muy por debajo de las expectativas de la Casa Blanca.

La propuesta de sentencia, que será debatida y previsiblemente aprobada, señala que, aunque el procedimiento utilizado fue inconstitucional, ello no afecta directamente al contenido de la ley de Telemadrid.

Según Trump, el país no aplicaba tarifas de manera adecuada y enviaba productos a EE. UU., generando un déficit comercial de 42.000 millones de dólares. Inicialmente, impuso un arancel del 30%, pero tras una llamada con la ministra suiza Karin Keller-Sutter, que describió como agresiva, decidió elevarlo al 39%. Esta decisión ha sido objeto de burlas en redes sociales, donde usuarios señalaron que la política arancelaria de Trump parecía impulsiva y basada en su estado de ánimo, más que en una estrategia económica definida. Posteriormente, bajo presión de empresas suizas, Trump accedió a reducir los aranceles al 15%, con un acuerdo preliminar que incluye la inversión de 200.000 millones de dólares por parte de Suiza en Estados Unidos antes de 2028.

El despiste ocurrió durante el proceso de compra en la plataforma Ticketmaster, donde ambos artistas tienen conciertos programados en España a lo largo de 2026. La similitud fonética entre los nombres y las prisas por conseguir entradas para el popular cantante puertorriqueño provocaron la confusión.

En un vídeo publicado en TikTok, una de las chicas aparece visiblemente afectada al darse cuenta de que había adquirido entradas para el concierto de Bunbury en Madrid, previsto para el 4 de diciembre en el Movistar Arena, con un precio de 165 euros.

Como consecuencia, el president afirmó erróneamente que no se habían activado alertas hidrológicas y dio por prácticamente superado el episodio meteorológico.

La comparecencia se produjo a las 11:47 de la mañana y fue retransmitida en directo por la televisión autonómica À Punt.

El anuncio fue comunicado a los gobernadores mediante una carta firmada por Kevin Stitt, gobernador republicano de Oklahoma y actual presidente de la NGA. En ella, Stitt explica que, al quedar excluidos los gobernadores demócratas de la reunión con el presidente, la asociación no podía seguir actuando como organizadora ni avalar un evento que contradice su misión principal: representar por igual a los 55 gobernadores y gobernadoras del país, incluidos los de estados y territorios.

Este resultado refleja una clara apuesta ciudadana por la moderación, la estabilidad institucional y el respeto al marco democrático, frente a los discursos excluyentes y polarizadores del populismo.

Seguro, un socialdemócrata de perfil moderado y alejado de la política activa durante más de una década, ha logrado un respaldo transversal poco habitual. Su candidatura atrajo apoyos tanto de figuras conservadoras como del ámbito comunista, lo que evidencia su capacidad para presentarse como un “presidente de todos”.

La entidad social señala que esta realidad afecta de manera especial a familias con menores, personas migrantes y trabajadores con ingresos inestables, que se ven obligados a convivir varias unidades familiares en un mismo piso o a ocupar viviendas sin las condiciones mínimas de habitabilidad.

El trabajo, realizado por científicos de la Universidad Tecnológica del Sur de China y publicado en la revista Device, no plantea una fuente de energía revolucionaria, pero sí una prueba de concepto ingeniosa sobre cómo captar energía ambiental para alimentar pequeños dispositivos.

El funcionamiento del pájaro bebedor se basa en un ciclo térmico sencillo. Al mojarse el pico y la cabeza de fieltro, el agua se evapora y enfría la parte superior del juguete. Este enfriamiento provoca la condensación del vapor del líquido interno, normalmente diclorometano, lo que reduce la presión en la parte superior del tubo.

El fenómeno, detectado en la mañana del martes y con una duración aproximada de una hora, no tiene precedentes en los veinte años de registros instrumentales en Tenerife. Según explicó Itahiza Domínguez, director del Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN) en Canarias, se trata de una serie de pulsos sísmicos de baja frecuencia que no pueden identificarse como terremotos individuales, a diferencia de los enjambres sísmicos habituales.

Los primeros análisis sitúan el origen de la señal en el oeste de Las Cañadas, a profundidades de entre 10 y 12 kilómetros, en la misma zona donde desde el fin de semana se han localizado más de 90 pequeños seísmos de magnitud inferior a 1,7, ninguno de ellos sentido por la población.

La compañía de Elon Musk ha obtenido una puntuación de 2,48 sobre 5, lo que supone una caída de 0,77 puntos respecto al año anterior, el mayor descenso registrado desde que se realiza este informe en 2013. En 2024, la marca había alcanzado 3,25 puntos.

El estudio, basado en encuestas a 27.000 personas, evalúa aspectos como dirección, finanzas, gestión, atención al cliente, calidad de productos y servicios, entorno laboral y sostenibilidad. Tesla no solo ha quedado en última posición, sino que ha sido superada en reputación por empresas de comercio electrónico como Temu o Shein.

Esta medida forma parte de una escalada en el conflicto entre el Kremlin y la plataforma fundada por Pável Dúrov, que se remonta a años anteriores con restricciones previas en llamadas de voz y vídeo. Las autoridades rusas justifican estas acciones alegando que Telegram no cumple con la legislación local, en particular en la eliminación de contenidos relacionados con fraudes, estafas y supuestos casos de terrorismo, lo que ha derivado también en multas millonarias que superan los 800.000 dólares.

Mientras el secretario del Tesoro, Bessent, defiende retóricamente un “dólar fuerte”, Trump y su equipo aceptan e incluso fomentan su debilitamiento, lo que ha generado volatilidad financiera global, subidas del oro y movimientos hacia activos considerados refugio, como el franco suizo.

La autora sostiene que esta estrategia es peligrosa porque el dólar sigue siendo central para el comercio internacional, la deuda soberana de muchos países pobres y la fijación de precios de materias primas clave. Su debilitamiento reduce el valor de los activos en dólares y tensiona los mercados, además de encarecer las importaciones en Estados Unidos y trasladar inflación a los consumidores.

La campaña surge tras la firma de una orden ejecutiva que declara una “emergencia nacional” por la supuesta amenaza que representa la isla, una calificación que los promotores consideran falsa y utilizada como pretexto para endurecer las sanciones económicas.

Según el manifiesto difundido por la iniciativa, el objetivo real de estas medidas es provocar una situación de escasez extrema de energía, alimentos y medicinas, lo que podría derivar en una crisis humanitaria de gran magnitud. La orden ejecutiva impide a Cuba importar petróleo y otras fuentes de energía, lo que tendría consecuencias directas sobre la vida cotidiana de la población, el funcionamiento de hospitales y la distribución de bienes básicos.

Tras revisar junto al congresista republicano Thomas Massie una versión sin censuras en el Departamento de Justicia, Khanna hizo públicos los nombres: el empresario estadounidense Leslie Wexner (fundador de Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch y Bath & Body Works, señalado como posible 'cómplice' por el FBI), el empresario emiratí Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem (director de Dubai Ports World, mencionado en un correo de Epstein sobre un 'video de tortura'), y Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov y Nicola Caputo.

Según datos del catastro elaborados a partir de información del Ministerio de Hacienda, más de 75.000 titulares poseen al menos tres viviendas en la región, más de 10.000 cuentan con diez o más y 517 llegan a acumular hasta 50. Esta tendencia se produce en un contexto de precios del alquiler y de compraventa disparados, que dificultan el acceso a la vivienda para jóvenes y familias.

El fenómeno no se limita a la capital, aunque Madrid ciudad lidera todas las categorías de grandes tenedores. Municipios como Alcobendas, Parla, Getafe, Las Rozas, Alcalá de Henares o Móstoles también concentran decenas de propietarios con carteras muy amplias. En conjunto, el número de titulares con entre tres y más de 50 viviendas ha aumentado en más de 2.700 personas entre 2024 y 2026, lo que confirma que la acumulación de inmueble]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-concentracion-de-viviendas-en-madrid-sigue-creciendo-y-agrava-la-presion-sobre-el-mercado-del-alquiler</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-concentracion-de-viviendas-en-madrid-sigue-creciendo-y-agrava-la-presion-sobre-el-mercado-del-alquiler</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 23:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno aprueba un anteproyecto de ley para limitar la privatización sanitaria y derogar la norma de Aznar de 1997]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Sanidad, dirigido por Mónica García, ha impulsado un anteproyecto de Ley de Gestión Pública e Integridad del Sistema Nacional de Salud, aprobado en el Consejo de Ministros el 10 de febrero de 2026.

Deroga la Ley 15/1997 aprobada bajo el Gobierno de José María Aznar, que facilitó modelos de colaboración público-privada como el conocido 'modelo Alzira'.

Una mujer de 34 años, con un largo historial de robos en Palafrugell y otras localidades de la comarca, ha ingresado en prisión después de acumular cerca de 40 detenciones. Hasta ahora, pese a la frecuencia de las intervenciones policiales, la sospechosa quedaba en libertad pocas horas después de ser arrestada, lo que generaba una sensación de impunidad entre los vecinos y frustración entre los agentes.

El ingreso en la cárcel se produjo tras una nueva detención el pasado 7 de febrero, cuando la Policía Local de Palafrugell la sorprendió saliendo de una vivienda con una bolsa, poco después de haber accedido al interior.

Esta decisión se produce a pesar de que el Tribunal Constitucional había anulado previamente el veto impuesto por la Mesa de la Cámara, al estimar recursos de amparo presentados por PSOE y Más Madrid. El TC determinó por unanimidad que tales bloqueos vulneraban derechos de la oposición. Los dos diputados del PP en la Mesa votaron en contra, dejando en minoría al representante de Más Madrid.

El vuelo afectado, SK2590 con destino a Copenhague, había recibido autorización para despegar desde la pista 07R alrededor de las 22:03 hora local.

Según la información disponible, la tripulación alineó la aeronave en la calle de rodaje E1, una superficie no destinada a despegues, y comenzó la aceleración como si se encontrara en pista. El avión llegó a alcanzar aproximadamente 107 nudos antes de que los pilotos detectaran el error y decidieran abortar el despegue. Tras la maniobra, la aeronave terminó parcialmente fuera de la superficie pavimentada y quedó detenida en una zona de césped próxima a un área de almacenamiento de combustible del aeropuerto.

González, por su parte, reprochó al PSOE y al PP la falta de autocrítica política y propuso adelantar elecciones si no se aprueban los Presupuestos Generales del Estado.

Moltbook se plantea como una red social invertida: los humanos solo pueden observar, mientras que las IAs publican, moderan y toman decisiones mediante una API. En apenas días, miles de agentes se organizaron en comunidades, generaron debates filosóficos, crearon normas internas y delegaron la moderación en un agente autónomo cuya lógica interna ni siquiera sus creadores controlan plenamente.

Más allá de la infraestructura, el texto describe la cultura emergente de estos agentes.

En un acto celebrado en Boadilla del Monte, Ayuso ha acusado al Ejecutivo de Pedro Sánchez de mantener una “obsesión” con Madrid y de intentar “acabar” con su modelo sanitario mediante amenazas, imposiciones y mensajes que, a su juicio, buscan generar miedo entre la población.

Según Ayuso, la norma estatal supone un ataque directo a la colaboración público-privada que defiende su Gobierno y que considera clave para el funcionamiento de la sanidad madrileña. La presidenta ha defendido que este modelo ha sido respaldado en las urnas por los ciudadanos y ha insistido en que Madrid es una “región de libertad” donde administraciones y empresas deben cooperar para ofrecer servicios eficaces.

En una entrevista concedida al programa Nothing Major Show, el jugador kazajo admite que el dominio ejercido por Carlos Alcaraz y Jannik Sinner, junto a un Novak Djokovic en la recta final de su carrera, ha generado una jerarquía casi infranqueable en los grandes torneos. Según Bublik, esta situación ha cambiado incluso el discurso interno del vestuario: ningún jugador del top 10 se atreve ya a verbalizar abiertamente que aspira a ganar un Grand Slam.

El tenista describe un escenario en el que solo circunstancias excepcionales, como eliminaciones tempranas de los grandes favoritos, abrirían una ventana real de oportunidad para otros jugadores. Recuerda precedentes históricos en los que el cuadro se rompió de forma inesperada y sugiere que algo así podría volver a suceder, aunque de manera muy puntual en los próximos años.

El agredido llamó él mismo a emergencias, aunque después minimizó lo ocurrido y se mostró reacio a presentar denuncia contra su compañera. Cuando la Policía Nacional llegó al domicilio, la mujer intentó ocultar lo sucedido alegando que las manchas de sangre en su ropa eran de pintalabios rojo.

Según explicaron, la acción tuvo un carácter político y simbólico, al considerar que muchas familias no pueden afrontar el precio actual de los alimentos en un contexto de inflación persistente. El reparto se realizó en puntos de acceso comunitario, utilizados habitualmente por personas con dificultades económicas, lo que refuerza el mensaje de denuncia social que el grupo quiso transmitir.

Este retraso responde a varios factores, entre ellos la necesidad de centrarse en la Luna, donde SpaceX busca construir una ciudad lunar antes de 2036, lo que considera más viable en un plazo de diez años debido a la cercanía del satélite y la posibilidad de asegurar la supervivencia de los colonos. Además, la NASA, bajo la dirección de Jared Isaacman, impulsa la carrera lunar frente a China, lo que aumenta la presión sobre SpaceX para desarrollar el HLS (Human Landing System) y los sistemas de repostaje en órbita necesarios para Artemisa III en 2028.

Esta medida responde a incidentes previos en los que Irán ha incautado buques extranjeros alegando violaciones como contrabando. Aunque continúan los esfuerzos diplomáticos, mediados por Omán, para abordar el programa nuclear iraní, misiles balísticos y apoyo a grupos armados, Washington mantiene una postura firme.

El texto recuerda que, desde diciembre de 2025, Ayuso habría bloqueado investigaciones y silenciado el sufrimiento de niños con discapacidad abusados en un centro que debería ser seguro, mientras despliega recursos políticos para respaldar al alcalde de Móstoles, Manuel Bautista, acusado de acoso sexual por una exconcejala del PP.

Nicholas Carlini, investigador de Anthropic, ha mostrado cómo el modelo Claude Opus 4.6, mediante un sistema de agentes trabajando en paralelo, ha sido capaz de generar un compilador de C completo en solo dos semanas y con un coste aproximado de 20.000 dólares. Este proyecto, denominado Claude's C Compiler (CCC), consta de 100.000 líneas de código en Rust y permite compilar un kernel Linux 6.9 funcional en arquitecturas x86, ARM y RISC-V. Comparativamente, desarrollar un compilador tradicional podía implicar inversiones millonarias y años de trabajo de múltiples ingenieros.

Después del paso de la borrasca Marta, que se suma a una temporada especialmente activa con ya 13 borrascas de gran impacto en lo que va del invierno 2025/2026, el patrón atmosférico comenzará a modificarse de forma clara.

Durante buena parte de la semana, el chorro polar ha circulado a latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, favoreciendo la llegada de masas de aire suaves y cargadas de humedad desde el Atlántico. Sin embargo, hacia el final de la semana este chorro se volverá más sinuoso, permitiendo la entrada de aire mucho más frío desde latitudes árticas. Este cambio estará reforzado por el desplazamiento de la dorsal anticiclónica hacia el sur de las Azores y la profundización de una baja en el entorno de Italia, lo que intensificará los vientos de componente norte y noroeste sobre la Península.

Los documentos indican que en 2011 Epstein se reunió con Christopher Poole, fundador del foro anónimo 4chan, poco antes del relanzamiento del tablón /pol/, que posteriormente se consolidó como espacio central de la llamada alt-right.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el congresista republicano Ted Hill, elimina la excepción que en versiones anteriores permitía izar la ikurriña en contextos culturales, como el festival Jaialdi de Boise, que celebra la profunda presencia histórica de la diáspora vasca en la región.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en la decisión del Ayuntamiento de Boise, gobernado por la demócrata Lauren McLean, de mantener la bandera del Orgullo Progresivo más allá del mes del Orgullo. En respuesta, el Capitolio de Idaho aprobó en 2023 una ley que limitaba las enseñas autorizadas en edificios gubernamentales. Para sortear esa restricción, Boise declaró la bandera LGTBIQ+ como oficial de la ciudad, lo que provocó una nueva reacción legislativa por parte de los republicanos estatales.

Los implicados eran trabajadores de empresas subcontratadas para el mantenimiento de las vías del tren, lo que les permitía acceder fácilmente al material y a los recursos necesarios.

La actividad delictiva se inició a finales de 2024 y consistía en la sustracción de cableado de cobre, tramos de vía, tornillería y otros elementos de las infraestructuras ferroviarias, principalmente en el tramo entre Vinaròs y Torreblanca. El material robado, que ascendió a más de 30 toneladas, era posteriormente vendido en centros de tratamiento de residuos de la zona, obteniendo beneficios superiores a los 15.000 euros.

La investigación comenzó tras una denuncia por un robo con fuerza en la zona de obras de la estación de Vinaròs y se prolongó durante más de cuatro meses.

El anuncio, lanzado en diciembre de 2025, utiliza el humor y la sátira para explicar de forma clara y accesible los argumentos oficiales que justifican la medida, así como sus posibles contradicciones y efectos secundarios.

El vídeo presenta la prohibición como una respuesta política a la creciente preocupación social por el impacto de las redes en la salud mental de niños y adolescentes, incluyendo problemas como la ansiedad, el acoso digital, la adicción a las pantallas o la exposición a contenidos nocivos. A través de un tono irónico, el anuncio expone cómo el Gobierno defiende la iniciativa como una forma de “proteger a los menores”, mientras evita abordar cuestiones estructurales como la falta de regulación efectiva de las grandes plataformas tecnológicas o ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bad Bunny agradece al equipo de Zara en Arteixo su colaboración en el vestuario de la Super Bowl]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los trabajadores de la sede central de Inditex en Arteixo, A Coruña, recibieron un inesperado reconocimiento por parte de Bad Bunny tras su actuación en el descanso de la Super Bowl 2026.

Según datos de Eurostat, la proporción de población que vive en viviendas con menos habitaciones de las necesarias ha pasado del 4,7% en 2018 al 9,1% en 2024, lo que supone un incremento cercano al 94% en solo seis años. Este aumento contrasta con la evolución media del conjunto de la UE, donde el hacinamiento ha descendido ligeramente en el mismo periodo.

El fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y de la compra de vivienda, que obliga a muchas familias a reducir espacio y privacidad para poder acceder a un techo. Aunque España no se sitúa entre los países con mayores tasas absolutas —muy por debajo de algunos Estados del este de Europa—, sí destaca por la intensidad del crecimiento, solo comparable al caso de Irlanda.

Según la sentencia, los hechos ocurrieron en la madrugada del 1 de diciembre de 2023, después de que agresor y víctima, que mantenían una relación de amistad y compartían problemas de salud mental, salieran juntos de fiesta y consumieran alcohol y drogas.

Sin embargo, presenta limitaciones como el ruido, las vibraciones y velocidades máximas más reducidas.

Este éxodo, uno de los episodios más trágicos de la Guerra Civil, dejó entre 3.000 y 5.000 víctimas civiles, en su mayoría mujeres, niños y ancianos, que fueron bombardeados por mar y aire durante el camino.

Pese a que el cine español ha tratado la Guerra Civil en más de un centenar de películas, ninguna había reflejado hasta ahora este episodio concreto. Arijo, que ha investigado a fondo la filmografía sobre el conflicto, considera que existía una deuda narrativa con la Desbandá.

El objeto, de apenas 63 milímetros de longitud y unos 1,5 gramos de peso, data del cuarto milenio antes de nuestra era y adelanta en más de dos milenios el uso fiable de la perforación rotatoria en Egipto.

Durante décadas, la pieza fue catalogada de forma imprecisa como una simple lezna de cobre, siguiendo una descripción escueta realizada en los años veinte por el arqueólogo Guy Brunton. Sin embargo, un nuevo reanálisis mediante microscopía ha revelado patrones de desgaste incompatibles con un uso por presión o percusión.

Aunque históricamente fue un pez muy abundante y presente en casi toda la península ibérica, la anguila ha perdido más del 80 % de su distribución original. El colapso más grave se produjo a partir de los años ochenta, coincidiendo con una intensificación de su explotación comercial, especialmente tras el declive de la anguila japonesa.

Utilizando un modelo esferoide de la Tierra (no una esfera perfecta), datos de elevación SRTM de la NASA con resolución de 100 metros y correcciones por refracción atmosférica (coeficiente 0,13), además de considerar una altura de observador de 1,65 metros, han identificado la línea más extensa: 530 km desde un punto en el macizo del Hindú Kush, en Afganistán, hasta el Pik Dankova, en Kirguistán. Este cálculo supera otras líneas destacadas, como la de 504 km entre Antioquia y el Pico Cristóbal en Colombia, o la de 483 km desde el Monte Elbrús en Rusia hasta los Montes Pónticos en Turquía.

El pasado miércoles anunció su intención de renunciar a la acusación, argumentando motivos personales y de salud, pero el escrito presentado no fue validado por el juez instructor, Adolfo Carretero, al carecer de la firma de su abogado y de un procurador. Tras conocerse el último escrito de la Fiscalía, que solicita la absolución de Errejón al considerar que no existió delito —ya que describe un encuentro sexual iniciado sin oposición inicial y finalizado cuando Mouliaá manifestó su negativa a continuar—, la actriz ha anunciado en la red social X que seguirá adelante con el proceso.

Antelo ha emitido un comunicado acompañado de imágenes del Ebro a su paso por Zaragoza, en el que insta al Partido Popular a exigirle a Azcón una rectificación pública de su posición sobre esta infraestructura hidráulica.

En declaraciones realizadas en Mataró, donde participó en un acto sobre economía social, Díaz alertó de lo que calificó como una «emergencia democrática sin precedentes», tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.

La dirigente de Sumar se refirió al contexto político tras las elecciones autonómicas en Aragón, en las que el Partido Popular ganó en escaños pero perdió apoyos y seguirá dependiendo de Vox para gobernar. A partir de estos resultados, Díaz acusó al líder del PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, de haber convertido a su partido en una «maquinaria de engorde de Vox», al considerar que su estrategia política contribuye a fortalecer a la extrema derecha en lugar de aislarla.

Su abogado ha señalado que Maxwell estaría dispuesta a ofrecer información completa sobre las relaciones de Donald Trump y Bill Clinton con Epstein, siempre que se le conceda inmunidad penal. La comparecencia, que duró menos de una hora y se celebró a puerta cerrada, dejó sin respuesta las preguntas de los congresistas sobre la red de explotación sexual y los responsables involucrados.

Acudió primero al Centro de Salud de Guía de Isora, donde le indicaron que debía ser derivada al Hospital del Sur, situado a 25 kilómetros. Sin embargo, la ambulancia no llegó tras cuatro horas de espera, por lo que decidió trasladarse por sus propios medios. Una vez en el Hospital del Sur, los médicos determinaron que su dolencia no podía tratarse allí y requería traslado urgente al Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, en Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a más de 100 kilómetros de distancia. Tras esperar una hora y media por la ambulancia, la paciente murió durante el trayecto.

La Plataforma Pro Hospital Público del Sur de Tenerife ha denunciado este trágico suceso, que atribuye a las carencias estructurales y de recursos del Hospital del Sur (conocido como El Mojón), un centro que lleva décadas sin ampliación adecuada pese a las reivindicaciones vecinales durante más de 30 a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instituciones culturales europeas reclaman a la Comunidad de Madrid que reconsidere el recorte al Círculo de Bellas Artes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 72 instituciones culturales europeas, integradas en la European Alliance of Academies, han expresado públicamente su apoyo al Círculo de Bellas Artes (CBA) tras el drástico recorte de financiación anunciado por la Comunidad de Madrid. El Gobierno regional ha pasado de conceder una subvención anual de 250.000 euros a limitar la ayuda prevista para 2026 a apenas 12.500 euros, destinados por ahora a la tradicional lectura continuada de El Quijote. La Alianza considera que revertir esta decisión sería una forma clara de despejar las sospechas de que el recorte obedece a motivos ideológicos o políticos y de demostrar que la libertad artística no está en riesgo en la región.

Desde 1983, el CBA recibía una subvención nominativa que gestionaba con autonomía. En los últimos años esta ayuda se había mantenido estable en 250.000 euros, aunque en 2025 se redujo a 100.000 y se condicionó a la financiación de actividades concretas.

Durante estos eventos, un miembro de la CIA supuestamente tomaba notas detalladas de las conversaciones. Entre las personas cercanas a Epstein menciona al exprimer ministro israelí Ehud Barak, cuya presencia en la residencia de Epstein en Nueva York está documentada en fotografías y se enmarca en operaciones de inteligencia secretas.

Las señales, firmadas por las juventudes falangistas de España, mostraban la silueta de un hombre agrediendo a una mujer mayor, un mensaje considerado por las autoridades locales como una clara incitación al odio y al racismo.

La mayoría de los estados se han negado a entregar esta información sin procesar, lo que ha llevado al DOJ a demandar a más de 20 estados. Sin embargo, al menos 10 estados —con más de 37 millones de votantes registrados— han proporcionado sus listas completas, algunos firmando un 'memorando de entendimiento confidencial'.

Este acuerdo revela intenciones preocupantes: el DOJ planea analizar por su cuenta las listas electorales y ordenar a los estados la eliminación de votantes específicos en un plazo de 45 días, algo sin precedentes que invierte el sistema constitucional estadounidense, donde los estados tienen la autoridad exclusiva para gestionar el censo electoral.

El joven había solicitado al juzgado el embargo de la pensión de jubilación de su padre para continuar percibiendo una mensualidad de 482 euros, cantidad que representaba aproximadamente un tercio de los ingresos del progenitor.

El tribunal considera que el padre no tenía obligación legal de seguir abonando dicha pensión desde 2018, año en que falleció la madre del joven. La pensión se había fijado inicialmente en una sentencia de medidas paternofiliales a favor de la madre como progenitora custodio tras la separación de la pareja en 2015. Tras el fallecimiento de esta, la obligación de alimentos en ese procedimiento quedó extinguida, por lo que el pago posterior realizado por el padre fue voluntario y no exigible legalmente.

A pesar de ello, el hombre continuó ayudando económicamen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-de-asturias-exonera-a-un-jubilado-de-pagar-alimentos-a-su-hijo-adulto-sin-estudios-ni-empleo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-de-asturias-exonera-a-un-jubilado-de-pagar-alimentos-a-su-hijo-adulto-sin-estudios-ni-empleo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Otegi descarta unir a las izquierdas y apuesta por una lista conjunta con el PNV en futuras generales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El secretario general de EH Bildu, Arnaldo Otegi, ha rechazado la propuesta de Gabriel Rufián, portavoz de ERC en el Congreso, de agrupar a las formaciones de izquierdas para enfrentarse al PP y Vox en futuras elecciones generales. Otegi considera que esta estrategia no es viable, ya que a menudo los objetivos individuales se anteponen a los colectivos, y recalca que EH Bildu nunca ha mantenido conversaciones oficiales con ERC sobre esta posibilidad. En cambio, el dirigente abertzale ha reafirmado su oferta de concurrir a unas elecciones generales junto al PNV mediante una candidatura conjunta basada en un programa de mínimos, con el objetivo de representar a la ciudadanía vasca 'como pueblo' y no simplemente como partido.

En declaraciones a la CNN, Oz reconoció que no todas las enfermedades afectan por igual a toda la población, pero insistió en que el sarampión es un caso claro en el que la vacunación es fundamental, especialmente para proteger a la infancia. Los brotes más recientes han afectado a cientos de personas en estados como Carolina del Sur, superando incluso cifras registradas en Texas en 2025, y se han detectado también casos en la frontera entre Utah y Arizona, además de otros estados.

Se destacan los fracasos estratégicos de Washington en conflictos clave como los de Líbano, Siria, Irak y Yemen, donde las acciones militares de EE.UU. no han logrado sus objetivos geopolíticos. En Líbáno, los ataques israelíes con apoyo estadounidense contra Hezbolá no destruyeron su capacidad de resistencia, sino que fortalecieron su posición. En Siria, las sanciones y bombardeos no impidieron la caída del gobierno de Assad ni el avance de grupos respaldados por Irán. En Irak, la expulsión de milicias proiraníes por el gobierno chiíta marcó un revés para la política exterior de Trump.

Alemany ha tratado de evitar un choque frontal con Rufián, enmarcando su iniciativa como un debate legítimo que interpela al conjunto de la organización, pero ha dejado claro que la estrategia republicana pasa por fortalecer “izquierdas nacionales enraizadas territorialmente” como respuesta al avance de la extrema derecha.

Esta cifra incluso supera los 273 millones que ya quedaron sin utilizar en 2024, lo que evidencia una baja ejecución sostenida en un área clave en un contexto de fuerte crisis de acceso a la vivienda en la región.

El contraste se produce al observar la evolución del gasto sanitario, donde sí se han aprobado ampliaciones de crédito. Entre ellas, destaca una inyección adicional de 25 millones de euros destinada a pagos a Quirón Salud. Este tipo de trasvases presupuestarios no es nuevo. En 2022, el Ejecutivo regional transfirió más de 191 millones de euros desde el remanente de tesorería de la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS) al Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS) para cubrir pagos por actividad asistencial realizada con medios privados.

Los cuatro pequeños clones de los protagonistas (Minichess, Minicas, Cuasimov y Minilem), que habían entrado a explorar, son expulsados muertos y desnudos, lo que genera alarma y sospechas de que el urbionte devora esencias o almas, dejando solo carcasas.

El autor rechaza de forma contundente la idea de que 'todos perdimos la guerra', argumentando que se trata de una manipulación revisionista que equipara a los golpistas franquistas con los defensores legítimos de la II República.

Destaca la manipulación del título del cartel (de afirmación a pregunta con supuesta 'errata de maquetación') y denuncia que dar voz a figuras como Aznar o Espinosa de los Monteros legitima planteamientos equidista]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-la-equidistancia-en-la-guerra-civil-rechazo-al-lema-la-guerra-que-todos-perdimos-en-unas-jornadas-suspendidas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-la-equidistancia-en-la-guerra-civil-rechazo-al-lema-la-guerra-que-todos-perdimos-en-unas-jornadas-suspendidas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 15:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vínculos editoriales y polémicas ideológicas en Vox Aragón tras el caso de Alejandro Nolasco]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza una serie de controversias que afectan a Vox en Aragón, centradas en presuntas conexiones con el entorno ideológico del fascismo y el neonazismo. El detonante inmediato fue el cese de Marcos Francoy, asesor del partido en las Cortes de Aragón, tras difundirse mensajes racistas, antisemitas y de exaltación fascista en sus redes sociales. Aunque Vox intentó inicialmente desvincularse alegando que se trataba de opiniones personales, la presión mediática y política forzó su destitución, provocando además tensiones en el gobierno autonómico de coalición con el PP.

Más allá de este caso, el foco se amplía hacia el portavoz autonómico de Vox, Alejandro Nolasco, quien ha publicado varios libros en SND Editores, una editorial señalada por su cercanía a figuras históricas y contemporáneas del neonazismo español. El texto detalla cómo dicha editorial ha difundido obras de personajes condenados por exaltación del nazismo, así como publicaciones que reivindican o justifican el f]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vinculos-editoriales-y-polemicas-ideologicas-en-vox-aragon-tras-el-caso-de-alejandro-nolasco</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vinculos-editoriales-y-polemicas-ideologicas-en-vox-aragon-tras-el-caso-de-alejandro-nolasco</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Una pintada en la Antártida reabre el debate sobre la protección del patrimonio en Isla Decepción]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Isla Decepción, en la Antártida, es uno de los lugares más singulares y aislados del planeta: un volcán activo cuya caldera es accesible por barco y que alberga una de las mayores colonias de pingüinos barbijos del mundo, además de focas y numerosas aves marinas. A más de mil kilómetros de cualquier núcleo urbano y con presencia humana muy limitada, este enclave parecía a salvo de uno de los símbolos más comunes del paisaje urbano contemporáneo: el grafiti. Sin embargo, en diciembre de 2024 apareció una pintada multicolor en un antiguo hangar británico construido durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

El artículo repasa la historia humana de la isla, desde los cazadores de focas del siglo XIX que llevaron a la especie al borde de la extinción, pasando por la intensa actividad ballenera del primer tercio del siglo XX, hasta la ocupación militar británica y la posterior instalación de bases científicas.

Esta declaración surgió como respuesta a un comentario del comentarista conservador Matt Walsh, quien criticó un anuncio publicitario emitido durante la Super Bowl en el que varias mujeres, que afirmaron haber sido víctimas de Epstein y su círculo, pedían al fiscal general Pam Bondi que apoyara su causa y liberara más información. Walsh cuestionaba por qué estas mujeres no habían nombrado directamente a los responsables, sugiriendo que podrían hacerlo de forma protegida a través de congresistas o que su campaña parecía haber comenzado justo tras la salida de Joe Biden del poder.

Babiš señaló directamente al entonces primer ministro británico Boris Johnson como el principal responsable, afirmando que tras su visita a Kiev las negociaciones se descarrilaron y se perdió la oportunidad de poner fin rápido al conflicto.

El político checo también comentó que actualmente los esfuerzos diplomáticos para terminar la guerra se han intensificado, aunque considera que Europa por sí sola no podrá lograrlo. En su opinión, Donald Trump es un actor clave para alcanzar la paz, ya que sin su implicación no será posible establecer garantías de seguridad estables para Ucrania.

Meidner, judío alemán criado en un entorno liberal y asimilado, fue testigo directo del colapso de la democracia alemana y del ascenso del nazismo, incluyendo episodios clave como el incendio del Reichstag y la represión de la izquierda. Estas vivencias alimentaron en él una convicción duradera: el fascismo no era un accidente, sino una posibilidad real del capitalismo en crisis.

Tras huir a Suecia en 1933, Meidner se integró en un país gobernado por la socialdemocracia y desarrolló allí la mayor parte de su carrera como economista jefe de la Confederación Sueca de Sindicatos (LO). Desde ese puesto fue coautor del modelo Rehn-Meidner, que impulsó la política salarial solidaria para reducir desigualdades y fortalecer la cohesión de la clase trabajadora.

El show, seguido por millones de espectadores en todo el mundo, incluyó algunos de sus mayores éxitos y la participación de artistas invitados como Lady Gaga y Ricky Martin, lo que generó una amplia conversación en redes sociales y medios de comunicación.

Aunque una parte importante del público y de la crítica valoró positivamente la puesta en escena por su impacto global y su mensaje cultural, la actuación también despertó rechazo en determinados sectores.

La sentencia, ya firme, se basa principalmente en una prueba de ADN concluyente: los forenses hallaron saliva de la denunciante en el envoltorio del preservativo utilizado, lo que coincide con la versión del acusado de que fue ella quien lo abrió con la boca porque él estaba nervioso. Los jueces argumentan que 'ningún sentido tendría que la víctima facilitara al agresor la penetración' de esa forma, lo que considera incompatible con una violación.

Aunque el testimonio de la joven cumplía los requisitos para desvirtuar la presunción de inocencia y fue corroborado por amigas y policías (relató bloqueo y falta de consentimiento), el tribunal también valoró positivamente la declaración del acusado por su coherencia y claridad.

El contenido fue difundido como un mapa que mostraba el riesgo de rotura de presas, lo que generó preocupación y sensación de alarma entre parte de la audiencia. Sin embargo, la información contenida en el mapa no se correspondía con esa interpretación.

Según aclaró la Asociación Meteorológica del Sureste (AMETSE), el documento mostraba en realidad el riesgo potencial para la población en caso de una hipotética rotura, no la probabilidad real de que dichas presas fallaran. Es decir, el mapa señalaba aquellas infraestructuras cuya rotura, en el escenario más desfavorable posible, podría causar graves daños a núcleos urbanos, servicios esenciales o al medio ambiente.

El paro, convocado para los días 9, 10 y 11 de febrero, se produce tras los graves accidentes de Adamuz (Córdoba) y Gelida (Barcelona), que han dejado 47 víctimas mortales, y tiene como principal objetivo exigir mayores niveles de seguridad, mantenimiento de la red y refuerzo de personal.

El seguimiento está siendo elevado, sobre todo en Catalunya y el País Vasco, según los sindicatos. En el caso catalán, se han registrado incidencias adicionales por problemas en la aplicación de los servicios mínimos, que los representantes sindicales atribuyen a que Renfe comunicó tarde dichas obligaciones a los maquinistas.

Esta alerta se produjo tras el estreno en Netflix de un documental sobre la desaparición de Madeleine McCann, en cuyo tercer episodio periodistas portugueses recordaban el escándalo de abusos sexuales a menores en la institución benéfica Casa Pia.

El correo electrónico, titulado 'Jeffrey Epstein', señala que, según los periodistas (incluida Felícia Cabrita), era un 'hecho conocido' que millonarios estadounidenses viajaban a Portugal en aviones privados para abusar sexualmente de niños de la Casa Pia, supuestamente con la connivencia de altos cargos de la institución desde los años 60.

Bruselas plantea que el recibo de la luz deje de utilizarse para financiar políticas ajenas al suministro eléctrico, eliminando conceptos no energéticos que actualmente se cargan en la factura, como determinados costes sociales o cánones.

El texto deja claro desde el inicio que no asume como verificados muchos de los hechos sugeridos en el vídeo y que el caso Epstein se utiliza más como metáfora de una corrupción sistémica que como un análisis jurídico riguroso.

El núcleo del discurso examinado presenta a las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas como un bloque homogéneo, coordinado y moralmente corrupto, enfrentado a una sociedad “normal”. Para ello, el vídeo recurre a metáforas como la “punta del iceberg”, a la insinuación constante de encubrimientos institucionales y a una ambigüedad estratégica que sugiere conexiones sin afirmarlas explícitamente. Esta forma de narrar permite mantener la sensación de misterio y conspiración sin comprometerse con afirmaciones verificables.

El descenso ha afectado especialmente a Zaragoza y Huesca, mientras que Teruel mantiene su representación.

España invierte en educación universitaria, pero su mercado laboral no absorbe a todos los titulados debido a salarios bajos, precariedad, elevado coste de la vida y escasa inversión en I+D (solo el 1,5 % del PIB frente al 2,2 % de media europea). Esto genera una 'trampa de desarrollo de talento' en regiones como Extremadura, Castilla y León o Castilla-La Mancha, que pierden población activa cualificada, lo que frena el crecimiento económico y debilita servicios públicos, creando un círculo vicioso. Aunque la fuga española es más interna (hacia Madrid y la costa) que externa, destinos como Alemania, Bélgica, Países Bajos e Italia atraen a muchos profesionales.

Esta reforma eliminó el requisito de distancia mínima de 850 metros respecto a centros educativos de secundaria, bachillerato, FP básica y enseñanzas artísticas profesionales, establecido en 2020 por el gobierno del Botànic para combatir la ludopatía, especialmente entre los jóvenes.

Nacido en Sevilla en 1960, fue guitarrista, cantaor y compositor, y uno de los principales impulsores de la fusión entre flamenco, rock y blues que marcó una ruptura estética y sonora a finales de los años setenta y durante la década de los ochenta.

Su trayectoria pública comenzó con el grupo Veneno, formado en 1977 junto a su hermano Raimundo Amador y Kiko Veneno. Aunque el único disco del grupo fue inicialmente incomprendido por crítica y público, con el tiempo se convirtió en una obra fundamental por su carácter innovador. Tras la disolución de Veneno, los tres músicos participaron en proyectos clave como el álbum “La leyenda del tiempo” de Camarón de la Isla, que supuso un punto de inflexión en el flamenco moderno.

En 1978, los hermanos Amador fundaron Pata Negra, proyecto en el que Rafael desempeñó un papel central como compositor y cread]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-rafael-amador-creador-del-sonido-de-pata-negra-y-figura-clave-del-flamenco-rock</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-rafael-amador-creador-del-sonido-de-pata-negra-y-figura-clave-del-flamenco-rock</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinball Map: el mapa colaborativo mundial para localizar máquinas de pinball públicas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pinball Map es una plataforma en línea fundada en 2008 que ofrece un mapa interactivo y colaborativo a nivel mundial para localizar máquinas de pinball accesibles al público.

La fotoperiodista italiana Valentina Sinis ha documentado esta realidad en su proyecto “Si las mujeres afganas desvelaran sus historias”, por el que ha sido finalista del premio Luis Valtueña. Sus imágenes y testimonios muestran cómo la exclusión femenina se ha normalizado hasta extremos cotidianos, como parques infantiles vacíos de niñas o calles donde las mujeres apenas pueden circular solas.

Las niñas afganas ya no pueden estudiar más allá de sexto grado y las mujeres tienen prohibido trabajar en la mayoría de sectores, acceder libremente a la atención sanitaria o compartir espacios con hombres fuera de su familia. Incluso se les veta la entrada a jardines públicos, símbolo de una expulsión deliberada del espacio común.

Los hermanos Aragón Bermúdez debutaron en 1939, en plena posguerra española, cuando el país acababa de salir devastado de la Guerra Civil. Procedentes de una extensa familia de artistas de circo, asumieron desde el principio los roles clásicos del trío de payasos: Gaby como clown autoritario, Fofó como augusto bromista y Miliki como contra-augusto, papel que desempeñó desde niño.

La España franquista, empobrecida y represiva, ofrecía pocas oportunidades, por lo que en 1946 decidieron emigrar. Su salto decisivo fue Cuba, donde no solo actuaron en vivo, sino que entraron muy pronto en la televisión, un medio todavía incipiente en el mundo hispano. Desde La Habana, sus programas se exportaron a numerosos países y los convirtieron en figuras internacionales.

Ambas sufrían lesiones físicas, un profundo agotamiento y una sensación de extrañeza que no asociaban al consumo habitual de alcohol. Esa falta de memoria y la necesidad de comprender qué les había pasado las llevó a repetir el mismo recorrido de la noche de la agresión: los mismos bares, las mismas consumiciones y el mismo trayecto, con el objetivo de descartar que hubiera sido culpa suya o una mala decisión propia.

Durante ese proceso, preguntaron a personas cercanas y reflexionaron sobre su comportamiento habitual, concluyendo que nunca se habían marchado con desconocidos ni habían experimentado antes una situación similar.

Sheinbaum defendió el apoyo humanitario a Cuba y aseguró que la isla cumple con sus pagos contractuales, sin facturas pendientes. En 2025, las ventas alcanzaron casi 500 millones de dólares (496 millones según Pemex), representando menos del 1 % de la producción mexicana de crudo, combinando motivos humanitarios y comerciales. El director de Pemex, Víctor Rodríguez, destacó que existe un contrato vigente desde 2023 y que Cuba paga puntualmente. La suspensión de envíos coincidió con la crisis energética en Cuba tras la interrupción de suministros venezolanos (debido a la captura de Nicolás Maduro por fuerzas estadounidenses) y rusos. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[México envía 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba con buques de la Armada por instrucción de Sheinbaum]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de México, bajo la dirección de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum, ha enviado más de 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba.

La medida establece que estos alojamientos no podrán superar el 15% del total de viviendas del municipio y, además, deberán ubicarse fuera del nucli antic (casco antiguo), que cuenta con un castillo declarado Bien de Interés Cultural.

El alcalde, José Luis Susmozas, explica que en los últimos dos o tres años los precios de la vivienda se han duplicado: casas de cien metros cuadrados han pasado de 200.000 a 400.000 euros, lo que dificulta el acceso a la vivienda a precios asequibles para los residentes.

Bret Devereaux explica que los romanos no sustituyeron la lanza por el gladius, ya que muchas infanterías mediterráneas también llevaban espada como arma secundaria, sino que reemplazaron la lanza por dos pila, una jabalina excepcionalmente pesada y diseñada para un uso táctico muy concreto.

A partir de fuentes literarias limitadas y a menudo tardías, combinadas con datos arqueológicos, el autor sitúa la consolidación de este sistema entre los siglos IV y III a.C., en un contexto de profundas reformas militares tras derrotas traumáticas y de la progresiva centralización del ejército romano como milicia ciudadana organizada por el Estado.

Uno de los ejemplos más destacados es el dibujo del Palacio de Valsaín, residencia real construida por orden de Felipe II sobre un antiguo pabellón de caza medieval.

Tras una investigación abierta por el Defensor del Pueblo, la empresa se comprometió a instalar fuentes de agua potable gratuitas a disposición de los viajeros en los aeropuertos que gestiona. Además, limitó el precio máximo de las botellas de agua en las máquinas expendedoras a 1,60 euros, medida que buscaba paliar las críticas por los importes desproporcionados que se cobraban en estos entornos. La memoria de actividad del Defensor del Pueblo recoge que esta decisión puso fin a la actuación iniciada por las reclamaciones ciudadanas. Paralelamente, el informe destaca otras preocupaciones de los usuarios, como la progresiva pérdida de espacio público en los aeropuertos debido a su conversión en grandes áreas comerciales]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aena-se-compromete-a-instalar-fuentes-de-agua-potable-y-limitar-el-precio-del-agua-embotellada-en-aeropuertos-tras-quejas-al-defensor-del-pueblo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aena-se-compromete-a-instalar-fuentes-de-agua-potable-y-limitar-el-precio-del-agua-embotellada-en-aeropuertos-tras-quejas-al-defensor-del-pueblo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 01:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Absuelto en Jaén un hombre acusado de violar a su hija tras la retractación de la joven en el juicio]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Sección Tercera de la Audiencia Provincial de Jaén ha absuelto a un hombre de 50 años que estaba acusado de violar y realizar tocamientos sexuales a su hija cuando esta tenía 10 años. Los hechos denunciados se remontan a 2017, cuando la madre presentó la denuncia tras descubrir una conversación en una tablet. En aquel momento, la menor relató que su padre aprovechaba cualquier ocasión para tocarla de forma sexual y la amenazaba con no volver a ver a su madre si lo contaba.

Durante el juicio, la hija, ahora de 18 años, se retractó completamente de la acusación. Declaró ante el tribunal que todo lo que dijo en su día fue mentira y que lo hizo presionada por su madre y por la excuñada de esta. Afirmó que nunca sufrió tocamientos ni violación, que llevaba años viviendo una mentira y que deseaba poder abrazar a su padre, algo impedido por la orden de alejamiento vigente.

Entre los sindicatos excluidos se encuentra el propio SFF-CGT, pese a ser uno de los que cuenta con mayor implantación en el sector y representación en empresas clave como Adif, Renfe, Iryo, Ouigo y Serveo, tanto en el ámbito público como en el privado.

Desde el sindicato consideran que esta exclusión no puede interpretarse como un simple error administrativo, sino como una decisión política consciente.

Con el 98% del escrutinio completado, la candidatura encabezada por María Goikoetxea se ha situado por debajo del 2% de los sufragios, lo que supone un fuerte retroceso respecto a los comicios de 2023 y la pérdida del único escaño que mantenía la formación morada en el parlamento autonómico.

Goikoetxea ha reconocido que se trata de un mal resultado tanto para Podemos Aragón como para la pluralidad política en la comunidad, subrayando que la convocatoria electoral impulsada por el Partido Popular no ha logrado su objetivo de alcanzar la mayoría absoluta, pero sí ha contribuido a reforzar a la extrema derecha.

La trabajadora reconoció los hechos y asumió la responsabilidad, alegando que tomaba la decisión cuando ya no quedaban clientes en la sala de ventas.

Con el 85,35% del voto escrutado, Seguro alcanzaba el 64,65% de los sufragios frente al 35,35% de su rival, confirmando así las previsiones de los sondeos a pie de urna difundidos durante la jornada electoral.

Este crecimiento no es neutro. La contratación de seguros privados no deja de aumentar y ya más de un tercio de la población catalana tiene doble cobertura, porcentaje aún mayor en Barcelona.

Según el Servicio Federal de Seguridad (FSB), el detenido es Liubomir Korba, ciudadano ucraniano, arrestado gracias a una operación realizada en cooperación con las autoridades de Emiratos Árabes Unidos. Moscú sostiene que Korba actuó siguiendo instrucciones de los servicios de inteligencia ucranianos y que viajó a la capital rusa en diciembre de 2025 con el objetivo de cometer el atentado.

Tras abrir fuego contra el general en un edificio residencial del noroeste de Moscú, el sospechoso habría abandonado Rusia pocas horas después y volado a Dubái, donde finalmente fue localizado y detenido.

El resultado es especialmente relevante porque el distrito había sido ganado por Donald Trump por 13 puntos en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, lo que llevó a los republicanos a considerar este escaño como una oportunidad clara para recuperarlo.

La elección especial se convocó tras la salida del anterior representante estatal, también demócrata, que fue nombrado comisionado del Departamento de Alcohol y Tabaco del estado por el gobernador republicano Jeff Landry. Aunque el escaño ya estaba en manos demócratas y, por tanto, no supone un cambio de partido, la magnitud de la victoria de Verret Martinez destaca por representar un giro de 37 puntos respecto a los resultados de 2024 en ese mismo distrito.

Aunque el área no estaba incluida inicialmente en zonas de vigilancia arqueológica, la Evaluación Ambiental estableció un seguimiento preventivo que ha permitido documentar hallazgos relevantes sin paralizar el proyecto.

Entre los descubrimientos destaca una necrópolis islámica de época andalusí, formada por enterramientos sencillos excavados directamente en la tierra y sin ajuar funerario. Los restos óseos aparecieron en niveles muy superficiales, junto a materiales cerámicos fragmentados y restos de vidrio. Este hallazgo se suma a otras necrópolis islámicas ya documentadas en barrios históricos como el Carmen, la Xerea o la Almoina, reforzando el conocimiento sobre la València musulmana.

Aun así, Serrano se declara desencantado pero no desligado de la política, defiende el voto como herramienta democrática y rechaza equiparar a todos los políticos por igual.

A lo largo de la conversación, aborda la normalización de discursos crueles, especialmente en relación con la inmigración y la precariedad, y alerta sobre la pérdida de consensos básicos que antes parecían incuestionables.

El 8 de febrero de 1937, tras la caída de Málaga en manos de las tropas sublevadas, una enorme columna de civiles —entre 150.000 y 300.000 personas— huyó por la carretera costera hacia Almería. Durante la huida, fueron atacados desde el aire y el mar, provocando entre 3.000 y 5.000 muertes, lo que convierte este suceso en una de las mayores masacres del conflicto.

El texto se centra especialmente en el uso propagandístico de la fotografía durante y después de estos hechos. Explica cómo el bando sublevado intentó ocultar la masacre mediante la manipulación de la información y el uso engañoso de imágenes publicadas en la prensa de la época, como en el diario ABC de Sevilla. Estas fotografías mostraban a supuestas familias “liberadas” regresando alegremente a Málaga, cuando en realidad se trataba de civiles capturados durante la huida y obligados a volv]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-desbanda-de-malaga-y-el-uso-propagandistico-de-imagenes-falsas-tras-la-masacre-de-1937</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-desbanda-de-malaga-y-el-uso-propagandistico-de-imagenes-falsas-tras-la-masacre-de-1937</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 20:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los chinos ya no creen en el Sueño Americano]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo analiza cómo la percepción del 'Sueño Americano' ha cambiado entre la comunidad china en Estados Unidos.

Las municiones de racimo están prohibidas por la Convención sobre Municiones en Racimo debido a su elevado impacto sobre la población civil, ya que dispersan submuniciones que con frecuencia no explotan y permanecen activas durante años.

Lluvias persistentes, nieve, viento y crecidas de ríos obligan a animales de muy distintas especies a tomar decisiones rápidas para sobrevivir, con un alto coste energético y riesgos reales de mortalidad. La supervivencia, según explican expertos en comportamiento animal y veterinaria, se basa principalmente en tres estrategias: buscar refugio adecuado, conservar el calor corporal y, cuando es posible, desplazarse a zonas menos castigadas.

En mamíferos terrestres, el principal peligro es la humedad prolongada. Un pelaje mojado pierde capacidad aislante, aumenta el estrés fisiológico y debilita el sistema inmune, facilitando infecciones y reduciendo la capacidad de reacción. Las madrigueras, que normalmente actúan como refugio seguro, pueden convertirse en trampas mortales si se inundan por la subida del nivel freático o la escorrentía.

Según los correos electrónicos incorporados a los archivos, Epstein describió aquel encuentro como una cena 'salvaje' y llegó a compartir la imagen con varios contactos personales. El evento fue organizado por el cofundador de LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, en honor al neurocientífico del MIT Ed Boyden, y ya había sido mencionado de forma parcial por Vanity Fair en 2019.

En la charla titulada 'Una conversación honesta sobre la IA y la Humanidad', junto a la neurocientífica Irene Tracey, Harari presentó la inteligencia artificial no como una mera herramienta, sino como un agente autónomo capaz de tomar decisiones, aprender y evolucionar, comparándola con mercenarios sajones que traicionaron a los britanos en el siglo V. Destacó especialmente una supuesta 'exclusiva': que las IAs han acuñado por sí mismas el término 'The Watchers' (Los Observadores) para referirse a los humanos, invirtiendo los roles de vigilantes y vigilados, lo que generó temor entre los asistentes.

La niña pidió en varias ocasiones que la bloqueara, pero él insistió en que disimulara ante sus padres. El abuelo materno descubrió los mensajes, ya que la foto de perfil del contacto era de un adulto, y decidió continuar la conversación haciéndose pasar por su nieta. En ese intercambio, el hombre reiteró su interés en fotos sexys y pidió que se eliminaran las conversaciones para evitar ser descubierto.

El reportaje de EL PAÍS analiza cómo este fenómeno genera una creciente inseguridad vital entre mayores de 45 años que no han podido acceder a la vivienda en propiedad y afrontan su futuro con incertidumbre.

Casos como el de Ramón Bultó, de 57 años, o Iván Aranda, de 46, reflejan una realidad cada vez más común: salarios relativamente estables que no garantizan seguridad residencial a largo plazo. La imposibilidad de ahorrar para la entrada de una hipoteca, el encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y la escasez de oferta empujan a muchos a asumir contratos frágiles y caros, sin la tranquilidad que tradicionalmente aportaba la propiedad como “plan de pensiones”.

Las muertes se deben principalmente a riadas, caídas de estructuras y, en cuatro casos, a accidentes de personas que intentaban reparar sus viviendas desde tejados ante la falta de ayudas rápidas y la amenaza de más lluvias.

Las zonas centrales del país permanecen en estado de calamidad, prorrogado hasta el 15 de febrero, con decenas de miles sin electricidad durante días, carreteras cortadas y alerta roja en la cuenca del Tajo.

Esta medida busca responder al fuerte declive de estas especies en entornos urbanos, provocado en gran parte por las reformas modernas y los sistemas de aislamiento que han eliminado los huecos tradicionales donde las aves nidificaban.

Los ladrillos Swift están diseñados para integrarse en el edificio desde su fase inicial, sin afectar a la estructura ni a la eficiencia energética, y con un coste muy reducido.

El documental de HBO Max *Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!*, dirigido por Judd Apatow y Mike Bonfiglio, repasa la trayectoria de un creador incansable que nunca ha contemplado la jubilación. Actor, guionista, director, productor y compositor, Brooks convirtió el humor en una herramienta política y cultural, capaz de ridiculizar el poder y desafiar los tabúes.

Nacido como Melvin Kaminsky en Brooklyn, creció marcado por la muerte temprana de su padre y por una infancia de burlas y precariedad. Esa mezcla de rabia y vulnerabilidad se transformó en su combustible creativo. Sus primeros pasos en la televisión, especialmente en *Your Show of Shows* junto a Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon o Woody Allen, lo situaron en el epicentro del nacimiento del humor televisivo estadounidense.

Por un lado, logró el récord del mejor promedio resolviendo cinco cubos con un tiempo de 3,84 segundos, y por otro, el récord del cubo individual más rápido con 3,05 segundos. Este logro es especialmente notable porque el récord de promedio es considerado más difícil que el de un solo cubo, ya que requiere constancia y precisión en múltiples intentos. Xuanyi utilizó un método avanzado llamado ZV, creado en 2003, que exige memorizar cerca de 800 algoritmos, algo que hasta ahora parecía impracticable para establecer récords mundiales.

Desde finales de enero, camina cada día 32 kilómetros entre su casa en Troarn y su centro educativo en Caen, en la región de Normandía. En total, dedica más de seis horas diarias a recorrer el camino de ida y vuelta, enfrentándose al frío, la lluvia y la oscuridad propias del invierno, con el objetivo de recaudar fondos para mejorar el acceso a la educación de niños que viven en zonas aisladas.

La iniciativa, titulada “480 km para aprender”, nació a partir de una reflexión cotidiana compartida con sus compañeros de clase. Mathis tomó conciencia de que muchas de las quejas habituales sobre madrugar o los trayectos largos contrastan con la realidad de miles de menores en el mundo que recorren grandes distancias para poder ir a la escuela, o que directamente no pueden hacerlo. A partir de esa comparación, decidió poner su esfuerzo físico al ser]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudiante-frances-recorre-32-kilometros-diarios-para-recaudar-fondos-y-facilitar-el-acceso-a-la-educacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudiante-frances-recorre-32-kilometros-diarios-para-recaudar-fondos-y-facilitar-el-acceso-a-la-educacion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La historia de iLovePDF: de un proyecto personal en Barcelona en 2010 a una de las 50 webs más visitadas del mundo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 2010, Marco Grossi, un estudiante barcelonés de Multimedia, Fotografía y programación, se enfrentó a la dificultad de editar un PDF de manera sencilla y sin pagar licencias caras como la de Adobe Acrobat. Tras dedicar apenas 15 minutos a investigar, decidió crear su propia herramienta online. Así nació iLovePDF, inicialmente como un proyecto personal que compaginaba con su trabajo de diseño web autónomo. Lo que empezó resolviendo problemas básicos como unir, dividir o copiar contenido de PDFs se convirtió rápidamente en una solución popular por su simplicidad, calidad y gratuidad. En 2014 pasó a dedicarse a tiempo completo, en 2017 abrió oficina y contrató equipo, y actualmente cuenta con 43 empleados. La plataforma ofrece múltiples funciones sin marcas de agua ni limitaciones severas en la versión gratuita, traducida a 25 idiomas, y elimina los archivos en dos horas cumpliendo con el RGPD y la certificación ISO 27001. En 2025 alcanzaba unos 150 millones de usuarios únicos mensuales]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-ilovepdf-de-un-proyecto-personal-en-barcelona-en-2010-a-una-de-las-50-webs-mas-visitadas-del-mundo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-ilovepdf-de-un-proyecto-personal-en-barcelona-en-2010-a-una-de-las-50-webs-mas-visitadas-del-mundo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 12:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Francesca Albanese denuncia la complicidad internacional con el régimen israelí y su modelo de control y exclusión]]></title><description><![CDATA[En una reciente entrevista con elDiario.es, la relatora de Naciones Unidas para Palestina, Francesca Albanese, advirtió sobre el peligro de que las democracias liberales adopten el modelo israelí, basado en la vigilancia y el control de las poblaciones. Albanese, conocida por sus investigaciones sobre las violaciones de derechos humanos en Palestina, expuso cómo grandes potencias y corporaciones internacionales, especialmente las europeas, colaboran con Israel en la venta de tecnologías de control social utilizadas en los territorios ocupados. En su libro 'Cuando el mundo duerme', Albanese profundiza en las estrategias de colonización y apartheid que, según ella, han sido normalizadas en gran parte de Occidente. A lo largo de la entrevista, hizo un llamado a la acción global contra la complicidad con Israel, incluyendo el boicot a empresas que se benefician de la ocupación israelí, como Booking.com y Airbnb, y destacó la importancia de la solidaridad internacional para poner fin al gen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francesca-albanese-denuncia-la-complicidad-internacional-con-el-regimen-israeli-y-su-modelo-de-control-y-exclusion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francesca-albanese-denuncia-la-complicidad-internacional-con-el-regimen-israeli-y-su-modelo-de-control-y-exclusion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 11:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Partido Popular es el único con representación parlamentaria sin protocolo específico contra el acoso sexual y machista]]></title><description><![CDATA[Según una investigación publicada por EL PAÍS, el Partido Popular (PP) es el único partido político con representación en el Congreso que no dispone de un protocolo específico para prevenir, detectar y combatir el acoso sexual y la violencia machista, a pesar de que la Ley Orgánica de Libertad Sexual de 2022 obliga a partidos y organizaciones a contar con uno. Mientras formaciones como PSOE, Vox, Podemos, Sumar, PNV o ERC cuentan con protocolos (algunos desde hace años y otros actualizados recientemente), el PP se ampara en su Código Ético y de Conducta, que menciona el acoso de forma genérica pero no detalla procedimientos específicos ni se ajusta plenamente a la normativa vigente.

El artículo vincula esta ausencia al caso de una concejala de Móstoles que denunció acoso sexual y posterior acoso laboral por parte del alcalde popular Manuel Bautista. La edil contactó en múltiples ocasiones con el PP de Madrid y el nacional, solicitando activar mecanismos de protección, pero recibió res]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-partido-popular-es-el-unico-con-representacion-parlamentaria-sin-protocolo-especifico-contra-el-acoso-sexual-y-machista</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-partido-popular-es-el-unico-con-representacion-parlamentaria-sin-protocolo-especifico-contra-el-acoso-sexual-y-machista</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 11:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miguel Tellado defiende a Vito Quiles y critica al Gobierno durante un acto de Nuevas Generaciones del PP]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante unas jornadas organizadas por Nuevas Generaciones del Partido Popular en Madrid, el secretario general del PP, Miguel Tellado, elogió públicamente al comunicador y agitador Vito Quiles, destacando su 'valentía' y su capacidad para dar voz a quienes, según él, no pueden expresarse. Tellado subrayó la importancia de la participación de Quiles en los actos del partido, recordando que el joven estuvo vinculado a la formación de Alvise Pérez, Se acabó la fiesta (SALF), antes de colaborar con el PP en varios eventos de campaña. 

Tellado estableció una comparación entre Quiles y el presentador televisivo El Gran Wyoming, argumentando que lo único que hace el primero es 'preguntar con un micrófono', algo que, según él, también hacía el comunicador en su programa 'Caiga quien caiga'. Cuestionó si algunos sectores políticos y mediáticos estaban aplicando un doble rasero al criticar a Quiles y no a otros periodistas en el pasado.

El Ayuntamiento vendió suelo público con el objetivo de promover vivienda social, pero el resultado ha sido una urbanización de alto nivel —con piscina, gimnasio y pistas de pádel— ocupada mayoritariamente por perfiles acomodados, mientras miles de familias siguen en lista de espera.

La investigación periodística ha revelado que entre los adjudicatarios figuran cargos políticos, técnicos municipales, familiares directos de funcionarios implicados en la tramitación y apellidos conocidos del entorno local. Al menos cuatro viviendas fueron adquiridas por personas vinculadas directamente al Ayuntamiento, lo que ha provocado varias dimisiones políticas y la apertura de investigaciones administrativas y judiciales. La Generalitat ha suspendido incluso a un funcionario que validó el expediente de s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-escandalo-en-alicante-destapa-el-uso-irregular-de-viviendas-protegidas-construidas-en-suelo-publico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-escandalo-en-alicante-destapa-el-uso-irregular-de-viviendas-protegidas-construidas-en-suelo-publico</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 10:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Decenas de manifestaciones en Francia contra la reintroducción de pesticidas por las leyes Duplomb]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado sábado 7 de febrero, decenas de manifestaciones se llevaron a cabo en toda Francia en rechazo a las leyes conocidas como 'Duplomb', impulsadas por el senador Laurent Duplomb, que pretenden reintroducir pesticidas actualmente prohibidos. Estas movilizaciones reunieron a activistas ecológicos, agricultores y ciudadanos preocupados, convocados por más de 80 organizaciones, entre ellas Greenpeace, WWF, Oxfam y la Confederación Campesina. Los participantes expresaron mensajes como 'Duplomb, no es no' y 'Más agricultores, menos pesticidas'.

Las protestas tuvieron lugar en ciudades como Lille, Lyon, Brest, Bordeaux, Valenciennes y Albi, con asistencia variable que osciló entre una decena y varios cientos de personas. Las críticas se centraron no solo en la legislación nacional sino también en proyectos europeos que podrían permitir la autorización ilimitada de pesticidas y la revisión de la directiva sobre nitratos, favoreciendo los intereses de grandes sindicatos agrícolas como la]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/decenas-de-manifestaciones-en-francia-contra-la-reintroduccion-de-pesticidas-por-las-leyes-duplomb</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/decenas-de-manifestaciones-en-francia-contra-la-reintroduccion-de-pesticidas-por-las-leyes-duplomb</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 09:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cuatro miembros del Comité de Garantías de Más Madrid dimiten por desacuerdo con cambios estatutarios]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cuatro de los seis miembros del Comité de Garantías de Más Madrid presentaron su dimisión el pasado mes de enero, argumentando que los recientes cambios en los estatutos y en el reglamento de funcionamiento del comité limitaban su autonomía. Según los dimisionarios, estos cambios reducen las competencias del comité y lo convierten en un órgano más controlado por la dirección, afectando su independencia y capacidad para supervisar el funcionamiento democrático del partido. En su carta de dimisión, Sandra Rodríguez, Alejandro Lerena, Txema Urkijo y Leo Bisignano señalaron que la elaboración del nuevo reglamento se hizo sin tener en cuenta sus aportaciones y desde un enfoque de control. Por su parte, la dirección de Más Madrid defiende que todos los cambios estatutarios y reglamentarios fueron debatidos y votados por la militancia, con un alto porcentaje de aprobación, y que buscan fortalecer los derechos procedimentales y jurídicos de las militantes implicadas en procesos del comité.
