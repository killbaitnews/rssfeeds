The country's military-industrial complex relies on a Soviet-era industrial base, supplemented with modern machinery, including CNC tools imported from China and Europe. From early 2023 to mid-2024, Russia imported over 22,000 CNC machines and other components worth approximately $18 billion. Facilities like Uralvagonzavod, dating back to the 1930s, continue producing tanks, while newer plants such as Yelabuga, the world's largest drone factory, produce Iranian-designed drones at reduced unit costs. Russia's production of artillery shells has tripled, tank production has doubled, and approximately 4.5 million workers are employed in defense, nearly 20% of the manufacturing workforce. Despite sanctions and rising costs for Chinese imports, Russia has been able to maintain and even increase production levels, accumulating more military equipment than it curre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russia-expands-military-production-despite-sanctions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russia-expands-military-production-despite-sanctions</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe’s Declining Economic and Military Relevance]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article argues that Europe, once a dominant global power, has now become militarily and industrially weak. It highlights that while Germany, France, and the United Kingdom still possess some armed forces, their combined active military power reaches only around 506,000 soldiers. When adding Turkey’s 355,000 troops, the total still remains modest compared to major global powers. The piece emphasizes Europe’s heavy dependency on foreign oil and gas and its lack of essential natural resources, which limits its geopolitical influence.

The author claims that Europe’s leading economies are stagnant and deindustrialized, burdened by debt and fragmented governance. Many European governments are portrayed as politically unstable, led by minority parties lacking public support. The continent’s inability to act independently in global affairs is illustrated through its reliance on former U.S. President Donald Trump’s approval for a proposed peace plan between Russia and Ukraine. This depende]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-s-declining-economic-and-military-relevance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/europe-s-declining-economic-and-military-relevance</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 10:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ownership and Social Impact of Artificial Intelligence]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article discusses an often overlooked aspect of artificial intelligence: its ownership. The author argues that AI, like any other production tool, will primarily serve the interests of its owner. The development, direction, and social consequences of AI will largely depend on whether it is controlled by governments or major global corporations. The article highlights that AI development is extremely expensive, with only the wealthiest states and corporations capable of sustaining the financial burden. Specifically, the seven largest U.S. tech companies are projected to invest $0.7 trillion by 2030, which will have dramatic impacts on resource consumption such as water and energy. Drawing a historical analogy, the article compares AI to water-powered looms of the late 18th century: if used in the public interest, such technologies can increase abundance and leisure time. However, under private ownership in a capitalist system, AI is more likely to accelerate wealth concentration an]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-ownership-and-social-impact-of-artificial-intelligence</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-ownership-and-social-impact-of-artificial-intelligence</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 07:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian missile strike allegedly targets drone operators near Odesa]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that a recent Russian missile strike hit an airfield near Odesa, allegedly killing around 30 people and injuring about 70 others, including Ukrainian military personnel and NATO specialists. According to pro-Russian sources, those killed were involved in operating long-range drones used by Ukraine in attacks against Crimea and other regions of Russia. The article claims that the attack destroyed a hangar containing drones and triggered a large explosion that was visible dozens of kilometers away. It also links the strike to a previous Ukrainian drone attack on the Russian city of Taganrog, calling this incident a retaliatory move by Russia. Another separate Russian attack reportedly occurred in the Kostiantynivka region, destroying a fortified observation post and killing several Ukrainian officers, among them members of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU). The overall tone of the article suggests that Western personnel are directly involved in Ukrainian military ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-missile-strike-allegedly-targets-drone-operators-near-odesa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-missile-strike-allegedly-targets-drone-operators-near-odesa</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 07:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gaza Civil Defense Rescuers Struggle to Recover Thousands Still Buried Under the Rubble]]></title><description><![CDATA[In Gaza, rescue teams from the Civil Defense continue to dig through rubble months after the bombings, searching for an estimated 10,000 bodies still trapped beneath collapsed buildings. The teams, like that of 24-year-old rescuer Al Shaghnobi, work with minimal equipment—only hammers, axes, and shovels—after losing most of their capacity due to ongoing Israeli assaults. Many rescues must be done manually, taking hours or even days per body. Some sites remain inaccessible because Israeli forces have designated them as restricted zones. For many rescuers, the mission blends exhaustion, trauma, and moral duty. Al Shaghnobi describes crawling through destroyed homes, finding entire families still embracing in death, and occasionally hearing faint voices of survivors still trapped alive. Another worker, Alaa Khammash, recounts the agony of not being able to save people and the emotional toll of recovering bodies of loved ones, including his own brother.

On Monday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) announced it had canceled the release of the advance estimate for the third-quarter GDP of 2025. Originally scheduled for October 30, the report was delayed due to the government shutdown and has now been abandoned entirely. This follows the Labor Department's cancellation of the October jobs report and the Bureau of Labor Statistics scrapping its inflation report. The White House blamed these delays on the Democrats, accusing them of permanently damaging the federal statistical system. However, these cancellations coincide with growing concerns over the administration's economic policies, including mass deportation plans and tariffs, which some experts claim could reduce the GDP significantly. Trump’s administration also postponed a report tracking consumer spending, earnings, and savings, which is ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cancels-economic-reports-amid-growing-concerns-over-his-policies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cancels-economic-reports-amid-growing-concerns-over-his-policies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Africa's forests have shifted from carbon sink to carbon source]]></title><description><![CDATA[African forests, which were once crucial carbon sinks, have now become a source of carbon emissions. This shift is mainly due to deforestation in the Congo rainforest, the second-largest in the world, which has been severely affected by logging and mining activities. From 2011 to 2017, African forests lost 106 million tonnes of biomass per year, contributing approximately 200 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. The Congo rainforest alone was responsible for a significant portion of this loss. These changes complicate global efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change. While satellite data has been used to measure this biomass loss, some experts caution that these measurements may not accurately capture the full extent of the impact, particularly when it comes to forests with different types of trees. This article also highlights the challenges of mitigating climate change in the Congo, where deforestation due to illegal logging and slash-and-burn agriculture continues t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/africa-s-forests-have-shifted-from-carbon-sink-to-carbon-source</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/africa-s-forests-have-shifted-from-carbon-sink-to-carbon-source</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paul Krugman Warns of Financial Instability and Potential 2008-Style Crash]]></title><description><![CDATA[Economist Paul Krugman has raised alarms about the current state of the economy, claiming that Trump’s allies are exacerbating financial instability. In a recent post, Krugman argued that the Trump administration's associates and financial supporters are actively dismantling the safeguards put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. He warned that this could lead to a collapse similar to the one witnessed in 2008. Key policies that are of concern to Krugman include weakened bank regulations and support for the unregulated crypto industry, particularly the GENIUS Act, which promotes stablecoins as a form of banking. According to Krugman, while Trump himself may not fully grasp the severity of the situation, his administration’s actions are placing the financial system at significant risk. Krugman urged the Democratic Party to be cautious, as the ongoing tariff policies and the growing influence of crypto could make another financial meltdown more likely. He stressed that Democrats sho]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/paul-krugman-warns-of-financial-instability-and-potential-2008-style-crash</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/paul-krugman-warns-of-financial-instability-and-potential-2008-style-crash</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 16:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Historical Roots of Anti-Tax Movements Among America's Elite]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article explores the deep-rooted anti-tax sentiments within American oligarchy, dating back to the founding of the nation. It traces a history where elite groups, such as slaveholders and industrialists, have consistently sought to undermine the government's ability to raise revenue. This has been done through manipulating tax systems, limiting tax enforcement, and employing strategies to weaken democratic governance. The piece connects historical moments, such as the influence of slaveowners in the formation of the U.S. Constitution and the subsequent attempts to limit the federal government's power to impose taxes, with contemporary policies under the Trump administration. The focus is on how a weakened tax system allows elites to retain disproportionate political and economic power. The author argues that without a fair and effective tax system, democracy cannot thrive, and the people's ability to hold government accountable is undermined. The piece highlights the long-standing]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-roots-of-anti-tax-movements-among-america-s-elite</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-roots-of-anti-tax-movements-among-america-s-elite</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 14:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Germany Faces Economic Stagnation and Growing Discontent Amid Merz’s Austerity Policies]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes the deepening economic and political crisis in Germany under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose austerity measures have sparked widespread frustration across all social sectors, including business leaders. Germany’s economic model, heavily reliant on exports, is faltering as imports from China surpass German machinery exports for the first time. Industrial production continues to fall sharply: machine tool manufacturing has lost 20,000 jobs in six months, the automotive industry 50,000 in a year, and chemical production has hit a 30-year low. Only the military sector shows growth, but its revenues remain minor compared to giants like Volkswagen.

Peter Leibinger, president of the Federation of German Industries, warned publicly that the economic model is collapsing. Government forecasts predict weak growth — about 1.3% for 2026 — driven largely by a 500-billion-euro stimulus fund aimed at infrastructure modernization and corporate investment incentives. However, priv]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-faces-economic-stagnation-and-growing-discontent-amid-merz-s-austerity-policies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-faces-economic-stagnation-and-growing-discontent-amid-merz-s-austerity-policies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 14:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cyberattacks Against Israeli Space Sector During Gaza Conflict Linked to Palestinian Supporters]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent report reveals that the Israeli space sector has been targeted by numerous cyberattacks between January 2023 and July 2025, with a significant uptick in activity during the Gaza conflict. The analysis, published by the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, documents 237 cyber incidents against Israel's space-related organizations, including the Israel Space Agency (ISA) and military contractors like Rafael. These cyberattacks, largely attributed to pro-Palestinian groups, intensified during the June conflict between Israel and Iran, peaking with 72 attacks in one month. The attacks were mainly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults, which flood websites with traffic, rendering them inoperable. Other attacks involved data breaches and leaks, some of which coincided with major military events in the conflict. The report suggests that the true scale of these cyberattacks is likely much larger than what is publicly documented.

While much focus has been placed on the fentanyl crisis, the U.S. is equally dependent on China for a wide range of synthetic substances, including medicinal components. The growth of China's pharmaceutical industry began in the 1950s, and it now plays a dominant role in the global market, especially in key raw materials (KSMs) necessary for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Approximately half of the drugs used in the U.S. come from China, which supplies at least one essential chemical for over 700 critical medications, such as amoxicillin. While amoxicillin seems to be imported from various countries, its four key chemical components are entirely produced in China. India, a major producer of generic drugs, also depends on China for KSMs, a dependency often overloo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-u-s-dependence-on-china-for-pharmaceutical-production-raises-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-u-s-dependence-on-china-for-pharmaceutical-production-raises-concerns</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 08:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's New Scientific Space Missions: Kuafu 2 Solar Observatory, Earth 2.0 Exoplanet Hunter, Hongmeng Lunar Radio Array, and eXTP X-ray Observatory]]></title><description><![CDATA[China has officially approved four new scientific space missions led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) for the next five years: Kuafu 2, Hongmeng, Earth 2.0, and eXTP. These missions are distinct from major national programs under CNSA and CASC, being more akin to NASA's Discovery missions managed by research institutes and universities. The Hongmeng mission will deploy a constellation of ten satellites orbiting the Moon's far side to study the cosmic dark age by observing low-frequency radio waves between 0.1 to 120 MHz. Kuafu 2 is a solar polar orbit observatory scheduled for launch in 2029 that will study the Sun's polar regions, complementing the European Solar Orbiter, and will conduct a historic flyby of Jupiter in 2032. Earth 2.0 is a multi-telescope observatory aimed at discovering exoplanets using transit and microlensing methods, targeting a launch in 2028 at the Earth-Sun L2 point.

Among the most targeted is Home Depot, which has become notorious for allowing ICE agents to use its parking lots for raids on day laborers. In response, protests and calls for boycotts have intensified. In one highly publicized protest, activists staged a disruptive demonstration at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, following the tragic death of a Guatemalan man who was fleeing an ICE raid. Protests like these, organized by groups such as the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), are designed to hurt the companies' bottom lines and influence their business decisions by drawing attention to their ties with ICE. Home Depot’s refusal to distance itself from ICE and its role in deportation efforts has fueled protests, including mass purchases and returns of ice scrapers at its stores, ca]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/consumer-backlash-targets-companies-supporting-ice-deportations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/consumer-backlash-targets-companies-supporting-ice-deportations</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 05:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Platform Offering Free Resources for Developers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article describes 'Free for Dev' as a platform aimed at developers searching for free resources and tools.

The Australian humpback dolphin, also known as Sousa sahulensis, displays remarkable cultural intelligence by finding and balancing sea sponges on their heads, a behavior that seems to be a form of sexual display. This ritual, which has been studied by experts at the University of Western Australia, demonstrates the dolphins' strength and coordination as they detach the sponges from the ocean floor and perform an elaborate juggling display. The use of the sponge, which requires significant physical skill, signals to the female dolphin that the male is capable and strong, making him a desirable mate. This behavior is part of a broader trend in animal mating rituals, where unusual objects or actions are used to attract potential partners.

These accounts describe acts such as targeting unarmed civilians, large-scale demolitions, and explicit orders to disregard international law. One of the central allegations concerns the so-called 'Mosquito Protocol,' in which Palestinian civilians, including minors, were reportedly forced to enter potentially booby-trapped zones, such as tunnels, in direct violation of international humanitarian law. The documentary’s interviews reveal that this practice became common among several Israeli units. Soldiers recounted how civilians were used to scout dangerous areas before the troops advanced, describing this as a normalized tactic within the army. Testimonies also exposed how field commanders interpreted any civilian movement as potentially hostile, leading to unjustified killings.

The study analyzed workforce data from 2.4 million employees across 142 companies and found that about 5.3% of laid-off workers have returned, signaling an increase in the 'layoff boomerang' trend. This rehiring surge highlights the current limitations of AI technologies, which often automate only parts of tasks rather than fully replacing human roles. Implementation of AI also involves significant infrastructure, security, and data costs, requiring human specialists to manage and correct automated outputs. Supporting this, research from MIT shows that 95% of companies have not realized meaningful financial benefits from AI investments. Additionally, data indicates that layoffs intended to save costs may be financially counterproductive once severance and other expenses are included. Consequently, busine]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/companies-rehire-former-employees-as-ai-automation-does-not-replace-human-roles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/companies-rehire-former-employees-as-ai-automation-does-not-replace-human-roles</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 01:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biological Computing: The Future of Hybrid Systems Combining Human Neurons with Silicon]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 2025, Australian company Cortical Labs unveiled its first commercial biocomputer, CL1, which utilizes around 800,000 human neurons cultivated on a silicon chip.

The restrictions, which create a no-fly zone above Mar-a-Lago, have redirected airplane traffic over nearby homes that were previously unaffected by aircraft noise or emissions. According to The Washington Post, the new routes cause aircraft to roar above residential areas from early in the morning until late at night, disturbing residents’ sleep and lowering property values by as much as 20 percent. 

The Secret Service justified the measure as necessary to ensure the security of the former president, stating that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was asked to institute temporary flight restrictions that will remain until at least October of next year. However, some locals fear that these changes could become permanent.

Her family, who has deep roots in Maryland, said she had no ties to Ghana. Video obtained by NBC4 shows Kuyateh being forcibly dragged by individuals her family believes worked for the Ghanaian government. Kuyateh’s son described the emotional impact, stating that he felt defeated and heartbroken. Kuyateh had been detained during her annual ICE check-in and later transferred from Maryland to Louisiana. A U.S. judge had ordered that she should not be sent back to Sierra Leone due to past torture, but the U.S. sought alternative countries, ultimately sending her to Ghana. During the flight, Kuyateh was shackled for ten hours. In Ghana, she was detained in a hotel before being forcibly moved toward Sierra Leone despite the court order.

Kallas claims that over the last century, Russia has attacked numerous countries, yet she fails to acknowledge the invasions Russia has experienced from European powers throughout history. The article highlights the historical invasions of Russia, the role of NATO expansion since 1991, and the ambitions of certain European leaders, like Poland's Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who have called for the fragmentation of Russia. The author argues that the true threat to Europe comes not from the East, but from the West, emphasizing the strategic interests that shape current political dynamics.

In fact, the true Prime Meridian has shifted over time due to advances in technology. The idea of a Prime Meridian, or zero longitude, is centuries old and was once based on celestial navigation, specifically the alignment with stars and time measurement. For many years, the Greenwich Meridian served as the world's zero point, but modern GPS technology has led to a more precise system. This shift began during the Space Race in the 1950s when the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite sparked scientific advancements. By using satellites, more accurate measurements could be made, taking into account Earth's irregular shape and gravitational variations. Over time, GPS systems based on this new technology became the global standard. As a result, the original location of the Prime Meridian at Greenwich no longer holds that status, eve]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-shift-of-the-prime-meridian-from-greenwich-to-gps</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-shift-of-the-prime-meridian-from-greenwich-to-gps</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 11:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Generative Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Daily Work in 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has established itself in 2025 as the leading technology transforming productivity in the workplace.

The journey is characterized by scenic landscapes, historic railway infrastructure, and a pace that allows for reading, drawing, and appreciating the surroundings. Key highlights include the historic construction of Spanish and French railways, the unique triple-gauge Latour de Carol station, and the picturesque Tren Amarillo, which ascends to nearly 1,600 meters. The trip emphasizes the cultural and historical significance of the regions traversed, including Catalan heritage, colonial textile towns, and fortresses from past conflicts.

More than 260 people died in the explosion, most of whom were Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The British had converted the ship into a prison, intending to deport nearly 1,900 refugees to colonies such as Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago. The conditions on board were deplorable. The Haganah opposed the disembarkation of the refugees as they did not meet the desired demographic profile of young, military-fit settlers. To prevent their landing, the Zionist group planted a bomb on the ship, causing it to sink in just 16 minutes, taking hundreds of lives before rescuers could reach them. Palestinian civilians, including fishermen and dock workers, were the first to reach the wreck and help the survivors, offering blankets and medical care despite the British presence.

While financial gain is often cited as a motivation, legal experts explain that many sellers are left with no alternative. High property prices force heirs to sell inherited homes if they cannot afford to buy out co-inheritors. Separations also contribute, as parents with young children may need to sell a property when it is no longer feasible for one party to remain. Lawyer Miquel Àngel Mas emphasizes that property markets are dynamic, and the challenges are spreading beyond traditionally popular areas to Palma. This phenomenon reflects broader social and economic pressures rather than mere preference for foreign buyers.

Despite past incidents, including a vandalism attack on a Satanic display in 2023, the state continues to enforce rules that prevent the display of certain religious symbols. The Satanic Temple has accused the state of religious discrimination, claiming that the rules are being applied in a biased way to prevent minority faiths from accessing public space in the same manner as Christian groups.

Interestingly, its origin is entirely different from its modern meaning. The term 'huevos' in this expression was originally spelled 'uebos', an archaic word derived from the Latin 'opus', meaning 'necessity' or 'something required'. Historically, 'Manda uebos' was the Romance adaptation of the legal phrase 'Mandat opus!', which conveyed the idea that necessity compels action. Over time, the Latin 'opus' evolved into 'uebos' during the Middle Ages. The modern spelling 'huevos' coincidentally aligns with the word for 'eggs', which has led to humorous reinterpretations related to male anatomy. Contemporary variants include expressions like 'manda cojones', 'tiene huevos', and 'estar hasta los huevos', all of which interchangeably use 'cojones' to convey similar meanings.

Embaló faced criticism for consolidating power and potentially staging a self-coup to secure his position amid contested election dates in 2024. Prior to the takeover, he had strengthened ties with Russia and distanced Guinea-Bissau from Portugal, including expelling Portuguese media outlets for alleged election interference. The military, led by Brigadier General Dinis Incanha, justified the coup as a response to plans by political actors and criminal networks to manipulate elections and destabilize the country.

Attacks on major ports and refineries, such as in Novorossiysk and Ryazan, severely disrupt oil flows. Sanctions by the US against major Russian companies like Lukoil and Rosneft have further complicated matters, leading to halted purchases from important buyers like China and India. The economic impact is evident, with oil-export revenues falling drastically, contributing to a major budget deficit of over $70 billion for Russia in 2025. The low crude prices, forced discounts, and extended tanker routes to markets increase the economic strain. Domestic borrowing to cover budget gaps is weakening the Russian economy, while the need to repair and defend oil infrastructure adds further financial burdens.

Unlike hard drives that store data magnetically, SSDs store information by modifying electrical charges in NAND flash cells. This data can degrade over time if the drive is left unpowered. Consumer-grade SSDs, which typically use QLC or TLC NAND, can lose data after 1 to 3 years without power, while higher-end MLC and SLC NAND can last longer. Temperature, NAND quality, and voltage loss are factors that affect data retention. Despite this, most users do not need to worry, as primary SSDs in active use rarely sit unpowered for extended periods. However, for long-term storage or archival purposes, relying solely on SSDs is risky. Experts recommend maintaining backups using multiple storage methods, following the 3-2-1 rule: three copies of data on at least two different media, with one copy off-site.

La jueza del Juzgado de Violencia sobre la Mujer número 3 considera el testimonio de la víctima contundente y verosímil. Dos de los detenidos ya tenían antecedentes policiales por delitos de agresión sexual, lo que ha influido en la decisión judicial de aplicar la prisión preventiva para evitar posibles fugas o reincidencia. Los hechos sucedieron a principios de octubre, cuando la joven, estudiante procedente de Almería, conoció a uno de los agresores en un local nocturno. Tras salir juntos, fueron seguidos por los otros dos sospechosos, que presuntamente participaron en la agresión sexual. Según el relato de la víctima, los tres la inmovilizaron, la desnudaron parcialmente y la violaron por turnos durante aproximadamente media hora. Tras lo ocurrido, la joven regresó al local, pidió ayuda a un amigo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prision-provisional-para-tres-jovenes-acusados-de-una-violacion-grupal-en-malaga</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prision-provisional-para-tres-jovenes-acusados-de-una-violacion-grupal-en-malaga</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Fiscalía archiva la denuncia por supuestas irregularidades en mamografías del SAS]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fiscalía de Sevilla ha decidido archivar la denuncia presentada por la Asociación de Mujeres con Cáncer de Mama de Sevilla (Amama) relacionada con un supuesto borrado de mamografías en el Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS).

Los fallos en el acceso a los historiales a través de ClicSalud+ y DIRAYA se debieron a saturaciones del sistema y a criterios de gestión clínica, descartando cualquier intervención externa o malintencionada. La denuncia también fue apoyada por el Defensor del Paciente, que temía la destrucción de documentos confidenciales, pero la Fiscalía concluyó que no hubo ningún delito de descubrimiento de secretos, daños informáticos ni obstrucción a la justicia.

En su mensaje, Petro subrayó que la medida responde a la necesidad de fomentar el diálogo y evitar la confrontación. Además, hizo un llamado a otros países del mundo para que sigan el ejemplo de Colombia y reanuden sus conexiones aéreas con Venezuela, criticando las restricciones impuestas por Estados Unidos. La ministra colombiana de Transporte, María Fernanda Rojas, también se mostró en contra de la advertencia de la Administración Federal de Aviación (FAA) de EE.UU., que había señalado riesgos de seguridad en el espacio aéreo venezolano. Según Rojas, esta alerta contradice los principios internacionales de la aviación, especialmente el Convenio de Chicago, que establece la soberanía de cada país sobre su espacio aéreo.

Wyden señaló que entre 2002 y 2016, JP Morgan solo reportó 4,3 millones en transacciones sospechosas, pero tras la detención de Epstein en 2019, se reportaron otras 5.000 transacciones por un valor total de 1.300 millones. Documentos recientes revelan que las cuentas de Epstein fueron supervisadas por ejecutivos sénior del banco, incluyendo al CEO Jamie Dimon.

El robo habría tenido lugar en 2020, cuando el grupo LuBian, uno de los mayores pools de minería de Bitcoin, sufrió un hackeo masivo, perdiendo más del 90% de sus fondos. Estos fondos, sin embargo, no fueron movidos durante varios años, hasta que, en junio de 2024, se realizó una transferencia a una nueva cartera. En octubre de 2025, el Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. acusó a Chen Zhi, un empresario camboyano, de estar detrás de la operación. Según el DOJ, los fondos de Bitcoin robados están relacionados con Chen y su grupo criminal. China ha sugerido que este robo fue parte de una operación encubierta de ciberespionaje por parte del gobierno de EE. UU.

Según Maldonado, esta metodología es obsoleta y limitada porque considera únicamente los ingresos monetarios en relación con una canasta básica de 52 alimentos, sin contemplar gastos fundamentales como servicios públicos, educación, salud, transporte y combustible. Esta medición oficial arroja una tasa de pobreza del 31,6% para 2025, pero otras mediciones multidimensionales, como la elaborada por la Universidad Católica Argentina, estiman que la pobreza real alcanza el 67,5%. El experto explica que cambiar la metodología tendría consecuencias políticas complicadas, ya que implicaría reconocer un porcentaje de pobreza mucho mayor, lo que demandaría mayores recursos para asignaciones y planes sociales.

Aunque el Ayuntamiento asegura que no ha cortado el suministro general, la situación real muestra un acceso deficiente y escaso, con colas largas y reducción del caudal disponible. Diversas organizaciones sociales y sindicales denuncian que la falta de agua y condiciones dignas en asentamientos chabolistas afecta a más de 3.500 personas en Níjar, con un grave impacto en su salud y calidad de vida.

Según su análisis, la dirigente madrileña estaría impulsando una estrategia destinada a generar un clima de tensión política y social, más orientado al impacto mediático que a un debate basado en hechos contrastados. Ekaizer sostiene que Ayuso recurre sistemáticamente a acusaciones, insinuaciones y denuncias sin base sólida, cuyo objetivo principal sería provocar un ambiente de confrontación y aumentar la polarización. En su opinión, este enfoque busca crear un ruido político permanente, capaz de influir en la opinión pública y deteriorar la confianza en las instituciones. 

El periodista alerta también sobre el riesgo de que este clima mediático sea utilizado para reactivar o justificar causas judiciales controvertidas.

Durante la redada se incautaron armas de fuego, munición, armas blancas, material táctico y documentación con ideología supremacista. 'The Base', considerado grupo terrorista desde 2018, busca crear un 'etnoestado' blanco mediante el caos y la violencia, atacando colectivos como musulmanes, judíos y otras minorías.

Si bien la medida es positiva, se argumenta que hay problemas inmediatos más urgentes que Renfe debería abordar. En particular, la segmentación de sus servicios, como la creación de distintas categorías de trenes (AVE, Avant, Media Distancia, etc.), genera confusión y molestias entre los pasajeros, afectando la conveniencia y la flexibilidad. Además, se critica que los horarios de los trenes, especialmente en rutas menos frecuentadas como la de Valladolid-Madrid o Badajoz-Cáceres, son poco prácticos y no ofrecen un servicio eficiente. En estos trayectos, la opción más adecuada sería tener una tarifa única con trenes en horarios fijos, más cercanos a la demanda real de los usuarios. La propuesta es que Renfe deje de funcionar como una aerolínea y comience a ofrecer un servicio ferroviario más accesible y práctico para los viajeros cotidianos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renfe-debe-mejorar-la-frecuencia-y-flexibilidad-de-sus-servicios-regionales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renfe-debe-mejorar-la-frecuencia-y-flexibilidad-de-sus-servicios-regionales</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 22:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nuevo servicio de tren de carga con horario regular entre Chongqing y Budapest fortalece el comercio internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[Se ha lanzado un nuevo servicio de tren de carga con horario fijo entre Chongqing, China, y Budapest, Hungría, con el objetivo de mejorar las conexiones comerciales y logísticas entre ambos países.

En un contexto de creciente obesidad, que causó 3,7 millones de muertes en 2024, la OMS subraya que la obesidad es una enfermedad crónica que debe ser tratada de por vida. Los fármacos, como los que contienen GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy o Mounjaro), pueden ser eficaces, pero solo cuando se usan con supervisión médica y a largo plazo. Sin embargo, la OMS señala la gran desigualdad en el acceso a estos medicamentos, ya que, aunque su eficacia está probada, solo una pequeña parte de la población mundial tiene acceso a ellos.

Aunque su significado actual se refiere a una expresión de sorpresa o incredulidad, su historia está relacionada con el término 'manda uebos', una versión romance de 'Mandat opus', que en el contexto medieval se utilizaba para expresar la necesidad de algo, es decir, 'la necesidad obliga'. La confusión con el término 'huevos' (genitales masculinos) es accidental, pero se ha aprovechado para dar una connotación más 'respetable' a la expresión. Así, el término 'huevos' ha derivado en otras expresiones que refieren a la virilidad o a la frustración, como 'tener los huevos por corbata' o 'tocar los huevos'.

Solo un 9% de los trabajadores del sector tiene menos de 30 años, lo que evidencia la falta de relevo generacional. La combinación de salarios ajustados, condiciones laborales duras y ausencia de formación suficiente ha generado un desajuste estructural que limita la contratación de jóvenes y la adopción de nuevas tecnologías. Los salarios han experimentado incrementos moderados debido al aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional y la presión por la escasez laboral, pero todavía resultan insuficientes para atraer a personal cualificado. La situación se agrava porque la mayoría de las empresas del sector son pymes o autónomos, incapaces de asumir costes salariales más altos, lo que provoca listas de espera y ralentiza el crecimiento del sector.

El contrato de alquiler especificaba que ciertos gastos individualizados, incluidos el IBI y las tasas de basuras, eran responsabilidad del arrendatario. Inicialmente, un juzgado dio la razón a los inquilinos alegando que la falta de especificación del importe anual invalidaba la obligación de pago. Posteriormente, la Audiencia Provincial de Palma de Mallorca revocó la decisión, considerando que estos tributos sí son individualizables y, por tanto, los inquilinos debían pagarlos.

El Consejo de Estudiantes de la UMA denuncia una infrafinanciación estructural que sitúa a la institución entre las peor financiadas de Andalucía y de España, con un déficit acumulado superior a los 216 millones de euros. Esta falta de recursos se refleja en aulas saturadas, laboratorios obsoletos, prácticas insuficientes, escasez de material básico e imposibilidad de estabilizar al profesorado. Paralelamente, el elevado precio del alquiler en Málaga —con habitaciones por encima de los 500 euros— dificulta que los estudiantes puedan continuar sus estudios en la ciudad, ante la falta de medidas de regulación o soluciones habitacionales por parte de la administración autonómica.
La protesta también critica la nueva Ley Universitaria de Andalucía (LUPA), a la que los estudiantes repro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-estudiantado-de-la-universidad-de-malaga-convoca-una-huelga-para-denunciar-la-infrafinanciacion-y-la-falta-de-recursos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-estudiantado-de-la-universidad-de-malaga-convoca-una-huelga-para-denunciar-la-infrafinanciacion-y-la-falta-de-recursos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 18:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP nombra a Mazón portavoz en comisión de las Corts tras su dimisión]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tras la dimisión de Carlos Mazón como presidente de la Generalitat Valenciana, el grupo parlamentario del PP en las Corts Valencianas ha registrado una propuesta para modificar la composición de varias comisiones. En concreto, proponen incluir a Mazón como miembro y portavoz de la Comisión de Reglamento, en sustitución de Eduardo Dolón. Al mismo tiempo, solicitan la baja de Juan Francisco Pérez Llorca de la Comisión de Gobierno Interior, quien será reemplazado por el nuevo síndic, Fernando Pastor. Esta comisión de Reglamento tiene escasa actividad, ya que solo se reúne ante propuestas de modificación del reglamento parlamentario. El nombramiento como portavoz conlleva un suplemento salarial de aproximadamente 634,77 euros brutos mensuales en 14 pagas, según datos del portal de transparencia de 2024, lo que equivale a unos 8.879 euros anuales, una cantidad que podría haber aumentado ligeramente.

Las denuncias fueron registradas correctamente, pero cuando las denunciantes intentaron hacer seguimiento en octubre y noviembre, el sistema indicaba que no existían. La dirección del PSOE admite una 'falta de diligencia' y atribuye la desaparición de los registros a un error informático y a un sistema que entra en modo de 'ofuscación' para proteger datos tras tres meses.

Tras más de dos décadas trabajando como panadero, su pensión mensual asciende a 900 euros, calculada únicamente en función de los años cotizados. En la entrevista con NoticiasTrabajo, Oswaldo critica la desigualdad del sistema de pensiones, comparando su situación con la de los autónomos, quienes pueden trabajar 30 o 40 años y jubilarse con cantidades aún más bajas. Además, destaca la disparidad de salarios y coste de vida entre regiones y países europeos, mencionando que su hija en Francia gana más aunque los precios allí son mayores. Durante su etapa laboral, Oswaldo trabajaba jornadas extremadamente largas y nocturnas, de 12:30 de la noche a 12 del mediodía, cobrando 1.500 euros mensuales, aunque estima que el valor real de su trabajo debería haber sido de 2.000 a 2.500 euros por las horas extras no remuneradas.

Sin embargo, las investigaciones se cerraron debido a la prescripción de los delitos y a la inviolabilidad del monarca antes de su abdicación.

En el caso de Italia, los salarios reales han caído un 3,4% entre 1991 y 2023, mientras que en España la mejora ha sido mínima, con un aumento del poder adquisitivo de apenas un 2-3%. Las razones de este estancamiento se deben a un modelo productivo de bajo valor añadido, la debilidad de la negociación colectiva, la externalización de trabajos, y la devaluación del trabajo para ganar competitividad. Aunque en España el aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI) desde 2018 ha generado una mejora significativa para muchos trabajadores, esta subida no ha sido suficiente para alterar la estructura salarial desigual del país.

Para shows pequeños con 50-100 drones, el coste oscila entre 5.000 y 20.000 dólares, ideales para bodas o eventos íntimos de 5-10 minutos.

Los grandes, con más de 500 drones, superan los 100.000 dólares para celebraciones nacionales o corporativas, pudiendo durar más de 20 minutos.

Factores clave que influyen: personalización de diseños añade costes por programación extra; shows largos necesitan más baterías y logística; permisos y transporte varían por zona urbana o rural.

El trabajador había sido despedido, pero el Juzgado de lo Social de Sevilla anuló el despido por vulneración de sus derechos, y fue readmitido en junio de 2024. A pesar de la readmisión, la compañía ha decidido reducir su salario, asignarle menos responsabilidades y despojarlo de su equipo. La empresa también ha cerrado la investigación interna sobre el caso, sin brindar más detalles ni tomar medidas contra el superior denunciado, Francisco Javier López Buciega. Varios empleados han dejado la empresa debido al mal ambiente de trabajo y las malas prácticas dentro de la organización.

La operación está siendo investigada por la UCO de la Guardia Civil, que sospecha de posibles comisiones ilegales. La demolición del complejo educativo fue adjudicada por la constructora Montepino, que convirtió los terrenos en una plataforma logística. Los pagos a la empresa de Cerdán se registraron entre finales de 2023 y principios de 2024. Aunque Erri Berri SL defiende la legalidad de estos pagos, la UCO examina si existió una relación irregular entre Cerdán y Acciona para conseguir contratos.

El estafador utilizó inteligencia artificial para crear vídeos en los que el actor aseguraba que usaría el dinero para construir una mansión en Hawái para ambos. La 'relación' comenzó cuando la mujer interactuó con una publicación en una página de fans del actor, lo que facilitó que el estafador entablara contacto con ella. A lo largo de las conversaciones, el supuesto Momoa le pidió dinero, explicando que su fortuna estaba vinculada a proyectos cinematográficos y que no podía disponer de ella. La mujer, creyendo en la historia, vendió su casa en Cambridgeshire y transfirió el dinero al estafador. Tras el envío del dinero, la comunicación cesó y el falso actor desapareció.

Expertos como Azahara Palomeque, Julen Bollain y Javier Carbonell coinciden en que factores como el origen socioeconómico, el género y el lugar de nacimiento determinan en gran medida las oportunidades, más que el esfuerzo personal. Un informe reciente de la OCDE indica que el 35% de la desigualdad de ingresos se debe a elementos hereditarios.[attached_file:1] En España, una familia de clase baja tarda más de un siglo en llegar a la clase media, según datos de 2019. Los jóvenes sufren especialmente: sueldos más bajos que los de sus padres pese a mayor formación, precariedad laboral y un mercado de trabajo débil con temporalidad alta. La vivienda representa un obstáculo clave, ya que las familias necesitan 7,7 años de salario para comprarla, el nivel más alto en 14 años, dedicando el 34,6% de ingresos a ella, lo que impide ahorrar o emanciparse.[attached_file:1]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-movilidad-social-en-espana-se-frena-origen-familiar-pesa-mas-que-el-merito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-movilidad-social-en-espana-se-frena-origen-familiar-pesa-mas-que-el-merito</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las restricciones físicas de Trump a la prensa: un análisis de las ocho medidas más significativas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde el inicio de su segundo mandato, el presidente Donald Trump ha intensificado los ataques a la libertad de prensa, trascendiendo la retórica y las políticas públicas para implementar medidas físicas que limitan el acceso de los periodistas a lugares clave.

Además, se ha limitado el acceso a tribunales federales y a eventos del Pentágono, con la intención de reducir la presencia de la prensa en espacios donde se toman decisiones cruciales.

El tribunal ha dictaminado que la mujer mantenía una convivencia estable con una nueva pareja, lo que constituye causa suficiente para extinguir dicha pensión conforme al artículo 101 del Código Civil. La resolución se ha basado en un informe elaborado por un detective privado, en el que se demostraba que la mujer residía habitualmente en la vivienda de su nueva pareja. Además, el informe confirmó que la casa donde estaba empadronada tras el divorcio se encontraba alquilada, y que una agencia inmobiliaria corroboró ese extremo. Con estos elementos, la Audiencia consideró probada una convivencia de tipo marital, pública y duradera —conocida en derecho como 'more uxorio'—, lo que justifica la eliminación de la pensión sin necesidad de acreditar una mejora económica derivada de la relación.

Esto ocurre porque el meridiano de Greenwich dejó de ser el meridiano cero hace décadas. Históricamente, el meridiano cero era arbitrario y variaba según el país: en Francia se usaba el de París, en España el de El Hierro y en Reino Unido el de Greenwich. En 1884, la Conferencia del Meridiano de Washington estableció el de Greenwich como referencia global para mapas y tiempo universal, gracias al avance tecnológico británico. Sin embargo, a finales de los años 50, el lanzamiento del Sputnik por la URSS impulsó en EE.UU. el desarrollo de satélites Transit en la Universidad Johns Hopkins de Baltimore, creando el primer sistema de posicionamiento satelital entre 1964 y 1968.

La tendencia hacia la abstinencia entre los adolescentes es notable, con un descenso del 24% en los últimos 30 años en el número de jóvenes que se emborrachan regularmente. A pesar de la reducción en los precios del alcohol, los consumidores no muestran señales de volver al consumo masivo, lo que ha afectado gravemente a marcas como Pernod Ricard y Diageo.

Desde los propietarios de esclavos en el sur durante la época colonial hasta los industriales de la Edad Dorada y el Partido Republicano contemporáneo, todos han buscado reducir la capacidad del Estado para recaudar impuestos y financiar sus políticas.

En lugar de construir un mensaje positivo y propositivo, el PP sigue centrado en atacar a Pedro Sánchez, sin ofrecer una alternativa clara o una visión de futuro para el país. Esto, afirma Sánchez, está agotando a sus seguidores, ya que las continuas protestas no generan cambios visibles ni avances en sus objetivos. Además, sostiene que cada nueva manifestación refuerza la imagen de un PP impotente y atrapado en un bucle emocional.

La ministra Pilar Alegría señaló que si el PP realmente quería protestar contra la corrupción, debieron haberlo hecho frente a su sede en la Calle Génova, considerada por el Ejecutivo como el 'kilómetro cero' de la corrupción, debido a su vinculación con el caso Gürtel y la caja B. Alegría criticó también que el PP no haya mostrado interés en manifestarse por temas como la sanidad pública o la educación. En la misma línea, el ministro Félix Bolaños acusó al PP de coincidir cada vez más con Vox en su discurso y estrategias, lo que refuerza la idea de que ambos partidos son 'indistinguibles'. La protesta, que contaba con 80.000 asistentes según el PP, fue más pequeña que las anteriores, lo que también fue motivo de ironía por parte del Gobierno.

Durante la primera semana, del 1 al 7 de diciembre, el paso de frentes atlánticos provocará lluvias en gran parte de la Península y Baleares, siendo especialmente abundantes en Galicia y más escasas en las zonas mediterráneas. Las temperaturas se mantendrán cercanas a los valores normales para la época, aunque serán más frías en el sur, donde se esperan heladas nocturnas en el interior. 

Para la segunda semana, del 8 al 14 de diciembre, la incertidumbre del pronóstico aumenta. Según los datos disponibles, se prevé un aumento de las temperaturas en la mitad norte y zonas del área mediterránea, con un ambiente más templado de lo habitual para estas fechas. Las lluvias más relevantes se concentrarían en el extremo norte, pero los meteorólogos advierten de que estas tendencias podrían variar con las futuras actualizaciones.

De acuerdo con un informe de la inmobiliaria Lucas Fox, casi cuatro de cada diez viviendas de lujo adquiridas en España son para primera residencia, una tendencia impulsada por nómadas digitales, emprendedores y ciudadanos de América Latina, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos.

Esta cifra, una estimación conservadora, supera el techo presupuestario del Ministerio de Defensa, estancado en unos 14.000 millones debido a la ausencia de Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Las aprobaciones incluyen proyectos como fragatas F-110, vehículos blindados Dragón, drones Euromale RPAS, aviones Eurofighter en el Programa Halcón, misiles Nasams, satélites PAZ II y el controvertido FCAS, un caza europeo de sexta generación, con compromisos que se extienden hasta 2042 [attached_file:1].

El aumento se aceleró desde 2022, impulsado por la guerra en Ucrania y el compromiso OTAN del 2% del PIB en defensa, que España prevé alcanzar en 2025 con unos 33.000 millones, duplicando el 0,92% de 2014.

Esta cifra, un récord absoluto, pone de manifiesto el aumento de la violencia extrema de los colonos, que no solo agreden a palestinos, sino que también atacan a las propias tropas israelíes. A pesar de que el gobierno de Netanyahu ha prometido una 'mano dura' contra estos extremistas, el conflicto parece haber alcanzado un punto crítico. La violencia, que incluye desde quemas hasta asesinatos, tiene su epicentro en las microcolonias ilegales, apoyadas por el gobierno, y ha desbordado las fronteras de Cisjordania.

A nivel global, la humanidad está utilizando los recursos naturales a un ritmo 1,8 veces superior a la capacidad de regeneración de la Tierra. Uruguay, sin embargo, destaca como un modelo positivo debido a su transición energética, que ha logrado que el 99,1% de su electricidad provenga de fuentes renovables. A través de su experiencia, Wackernagel señala que si todos los países siguieran el ejemplo de Uruguay, el planeta entraría en déficit ecológico mucho más tarde, lo que permitiría un uso más sostenible de los recursos. La clave de esta transformación en Uruguay fue una combinación de políticas públicas de largo plazo, una gobernanza de colaboración público-privada y una profunda revisión del marco regulatorio para facilitar el uso de energías renovables.

Durante la época republicana, bajo la Generalitat de Cataluña con Francesc Macià, continuó siendo un lugar donde se reprimió y torturó a sindicalistas y anarquistas, conocido entre los trabajadores como 'El Molino sangriento'. En diciembre de 1933 se produjo una insurrección anarquista que llevó a numerosas detenciones y torturas en esta comisaría, con víctimas tanto de Barcelona como de poblaciones cercanas. Los informes forenses y testimonios de detenidos detallan graves lesiones y maltratos sufridos.

Este acuerdo ha reavivado la polémica sobre la adquisición de la entidad en 1992 por parte de Jesús Gil y Enrique Cerezo, quienes accedieron a la propiedad en un proceso judicialmente calificado como un “fraude de ley”. A pesar de que los tribunales confirmaron que el proceso de compra fue ilegal, las acciones de los nuevos propietarios fueron prescritas, lo que permitió que continuaran al frente del club. Este caso se remonta a la conversión del Atlético de Madrid en una Sociedad Anónima Deportiva, cuando las autoridades deportivas permitieron que Gil y Cerezo se hicieran con el control del club a través de un complejo entramado financiero.

Esto se debe principalmente a la destrucción de la selva tropical del Congo, la segunda más grande del mundo después del Amazonas, que ha experimentado una deforestación masiva debido a la tala ilegal y la minería. De hecho, entre 2011 y 2017, los bosques africanos perdieron 106 millones de toneladas de biomasa por año, lo que equivaldría a la emisión de unos 200 millones de toneladas de CO2.

Una furgoneta atropelló a un repartidor de la empresa Glovo que circulaba en motocicleta e, increíblemente, continuó su marcha con la víctima enganchada al capó del vehículo durante varios centenares de metros. Varios conductores grabaron el suceso, que rápidamente se viralizó en redes sociales y causó una gran conmoción por su peligrosidad. En las imágenes se aprecia al repartidor tratando de aferrarse y moverse desesperadamente mientras otros vehículos hacían sonar sus claxon para alertar al conductor. Según informaciones del servicio de emergencias 112, las llamadas de testigos fueron múltiples y describieron el hecho como un atropello intencionado, o al menos extremadamente negligente. De inmediato, se desplazaron hasta la zona la Guardia Civil de Tráfico y efectivos sanitarios.

Describe una red de favores y pactos tácitos entre élites que impide reformas reales, con procesos judiciales eternos mientras el dinero público se desvanece en comisiones y contratos amañados. Destaca casos recientes como el de Koldo García, exasesor de Ábalos, implicado en una trama de mascarillas que facturó 52 millones de euros durante la pandemia; el Supremo propone juzgarlo por cohecho, malversación y organización criminal. También menciona la investigación abierta contra Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente, por tráfico de influencias en contratos y su cátedra universitaria. En datos, Andalucía cerró 70 acusados en 12 procedimientos en 2024, la Fiscalía intervino en 885 casos en 2023 y GRECO alerta de incumplimientos en 2025, con España en su peor puesto en el Índice de Percepción de la Corrupción.

La presentación del libro en Madrid requirió la presencia de tres escoltas por amenazas previas, lo que refleja el clima de tensión alrededor del asunto. El autor sostiene que existen denuncias que se utilizan de forma instrumental para obtener ventajas legales o económicas en procesos de separación o custodia. Aunque la Fiscalía indica que solo el 0,0082% de las denuncias se consideran falsas, varios abogados y asociaciones, como Genmad, afirman que el número real es mucho mayor. Antonia Carrasco, presidenta de esta asociación, critica la Ley de Violencia de Género de 2004 y afirma que algunas mujeres la utilizan como herramienta de venganza.

El incremento de la demanda, impulsado por políticas de gratuidad parcial, bonificaciones y un cambio social hacia la movilidad sostenible, ha superado la capacidad de autobuses, metro y trenes de cercanías. Sin embargo, las inversiones para mejorar el servicio no han acompañado este auge. Según un estudio de la Universitat de València, el tráfico rodado en accesos y zonas internas de la ciudad ha caído notablemente desde 2008, mientras que el uso de bicicletas y transporte colectivo se ha disparado. Aun así, la oferta de transporte por habitante sigue siendo menos de la mitad de la de Madrid o Barcelona.

Este término, originado en la Alemania nazi, describe un sistema jurídico en el que las leyes se aplican de manera desigual según la pertenencia a ciertos colectivos. En su artículo 14, la Constitución española garantiza la igualdad ante la ley, pero la sentencia de 2008 en el caso de la Ley de Violencia de Género ha alterado este principio, aplicando un doble Derecho Penal que favorece a ciertos grupos mientras discrimina a otros, como el colectivo LGTBI+. Los críticos, como el autor Juan Soto Ivars, denuncian que este tipo de legislación ha llevado a la creación de un Derecho Penal de Autor, donde los acusados son tratados no según sus actos, sino según su pertenencia a un grupo determinado.

Todo ello deja a la UE en una posición de debilidad geopolítica. 

A pesar de los intentos por reforzar su autonomía estratégica —con un aumento del gasto militar, reformas para reducir la burocracia y la negociación de acuerdos comerciales como el de Mercosur—, las acciones concretas no alcanzan para invertir la tendencia.

En total, 58 multimillonarios recibieron cheques por valor de 1,11 dólares. Sorprendentemente, 26 de ellos se molestaron en ir al banco a cobrar esa ínfima cantidad. El experimento continuó con cheques de mayor valor, pero el porcentaje de cobros fue decreciendo a medida que la cantidad aumentaba. Los resultados revelaron una relación psicológica de los millonarios con el dinero: independientemente de la cantidad, siempre existe la motivación por obtener más, incluso si es a costa de un esfuerzo mínimo. Entre los que cobraron los cheques más pequeños destacan nombres como Donald Trump, quien no dudó en aprovechar hasta la más mínima oportunidad de ganar dinero.

Esta conclusión se ha alcanzado tras las investigaciones realizadas durante la jornada. Según las fuentes del cuerpo policial, no existen pruebas que sugieran la intervención de terceras personas en el suceso, y el juez ha ordenado mantener el secreto de sumario mientras continúan las diligencias. La noticia ha conmocionado a la ciudad, lo que ha llevado al Ayuntamiento de Jaén a decretar tres días de luto oficial, con las banderas a media asta en el edificio consistorial desde las 00:00 horas del domingo hasta el martes 2 de diciembre. Además, se celebrará un minuto de silencio el lunes a las 12:00 horas en memoria de las jóvenes, invitando a la ciudadanía a participar.

No obstante, le ha ofrecido declarar de forma voluntaria, ya que considera poco probable que no oyera al dirigente hablar por teléfono durante la comida en el restaurante 'El Ventorro'. También se ha dado la misma opción a la consellera de Justicia e Interior, Salomé Pradas, tras su entrevista en el programa 'Salvados', aunque ambas han rechazado volver a declarar.

Luis Gomis, director general de Medio Natural, declaró ante la jueza que el ofrecimiento de los agentes fue ignorado, a pesar de que estos agentes son clave en el Plan de Inundaciones para la vigilancia de caudales. Tras la retirada de los bomberos que vigilaban el barranco, Emergencias se quedó sin apoyo para controlar los caudales, lo que derivó en una gestión deficiente durante la emergencia. En su declaración, Gomis explicó que la activación de los agentes medioambientales no requería una petición formal y podía haberse hecho mediante una simple comunicación interna entre departamentos.

En las imágenes se les ve rendirse y tenderse en el suelo antes de ser asesinados por los militares, que posteriormente trasladaron sus cuerpos. Este incidente ha provocado una fuerte condena por parte de la Autoridad Palestina, que lo califica como una 'ejecución extrajudicial', y organizaciones internacionales como la ONU también han expresado su preocupación. Aunque el Ejército israelí afirma que los dos hombres estaban involucrados en actividades terroristas, no ha presentado pruebas. El ministro de Seguridad Nacional de Israel ha respaldado públicamente las acciones de los soldados, lo que ha incrementado las críticas por la falta de rendición de cuentas.

Calhoun en la década de 1970 para estudiar los efectos del hacinamiento en una colonia de ratones. En un entorno controlado donde se ofrecía comida, agua y refugio en abundancia, cuatro parejas de ratones fueron introducidas para reproducirse sin limitaciones externas. Al principio, la población creció rápidamente y parecía una utopía, pero pronto se observaron comportamientos sociales destructivos como violencia, agresividad, aislamiento y pérdida de la función reproductiva. La sobrepoblación provocó un colapso social en la colonia, con consecuencias que llevaron a la extinción de la población. Este experimento ha sido interpretado como una advertencia sobre los riesgos del hacinamiento y la falta de recursos sociales y psicológicos en sociedades humanas.

Mientras que Sumar presentó una propuesta para frenar la especulación inmobiliaria y limitar la compra de viviendas por parte de fondos y empresas, el PSOE mostró su apoyo a la medida solo en Europa, pidiendo que la Unión Europea permita a los gobiernos nacionales frenar la compra especulativa en zonas tensionadas. Este desacuerdo interno dentro de la coalición ha puesto en evidencia la falta de consenso sobre cómo afrontar la crisis de la vivienda en España. A pesar de las propuestas de Sumar y otros partidos como ERC, Bildu y Podemos, el PSOE se ha mostrado más cauteloso, defendiendo un enfoque que dé prioridad a la seguridad jurídica y la cooperación con Europa.

El contrato establecía que la agencia cobraría una comisión del 4,8% únicamente si encontraba un comprador. Sin embargo, el comprador apareció por una vía completamente distinta, a través de un conocido del propietario, lo que permitió cerrar la operación sin la intervención de la inmobiliaria. Aun así, la agencia aseguró que, al no haberse encargado de la venta, solo facturaría los “servicios realizados”, entre ellos la publicación del anuncio, la gestión de visitas y el filtrado de potenciales interesados.

La sorpresa llegó cuando el propietario recibió la factura detallada, que incluía conceptos como visitas valoradas en 825 euros, filtrado económico por 160 euros o cuotas de mantenimiento del anuncio. En total, 1.900 euros más IVA.

La investigación revela que los acusados conocían a la víctima desde 2023 y aprovecharon su vulnerabilidad emocional, generada por supuestos ruidos de origen 'sobrenatural', para manipularla. Los pastores habrían convencido a la anciana de que debía abandonar su hogar para protegerse, llevándola a la iglesia y luego a firmar un boleto de compraventa con la promesa de un pago que nunca se completó. Posteriormente, la mujer fue trasladada a la casa de la madre de la imputada, donde permaneció incomunicada y sin acceso a sus documentos ni a su jubilación.

Serrano remitió correos internos reclamando la aplicación estricta de la ley de contratos del sector público, manifestando su oposición a que las obras se ejecutaran sin concurso. Sin embargo, no recibió respuesta alguna de la administración.

El delfín de nariz de botella, conocido científicamente como Sousa sahulensis, busca una esponja, la arranca del fondo marino y la coloca sobre su cabeza para impresionar a las hembras. Este comportamiento, considerado como una demostración de fuerza, coordinación y resistencia, revela una complejidad social y cultural inédita en mamíferos marinos no humanos. Los científicos de la Universidad de Australia Occidental han documentado este ritual como un acto multimodal que combina señales visuales, táctiles y acústicas. Aunque esta práctica pueda parecer extraña, se trata de una forma de cortejo que muestra la capacidad del macho para realizar tareas difíciles, lo que lo convierte en un candidato ideal para la reproducción.

La solicitud de la ETA deberá realizarse de forma digital, antes del viaje, a través de la aplicación o página web oficial 'UK ETA'. La autorización tendrá una validez de dos años, o hasta la fecha de caducidad del pasaporte utilizado. Es importante destacar que, aunque se obtenga la ETA, no garantiza la entrada al país, ya que la decisión final depende del control fronterizo británico. Este cambio se implementa como parte de un esfuerzo por reforzar la seguridad en las fronteras británicas, tras la salida del Reino Unido de la Unión Europea.

Krugman señala que, aunque Trump es un actor central, sus colaboradores y aliados en el Congreso y la Reserva Federal están debilitando supervisiones bancarias clave y promoviendo un uso más amplio de criptomonedas, lo que aumenta la vulnerabilidad del sistema financiero. Un ejemplo reciente es la aprobación del GENIUS Act, que promueve stablecoins, consideradas por Krugman como una forma de banca débilmente regulada que podría desestabilizar aún más la economía. El economista recalca que las medidas de protección implementadas tras la crisis de 2008 se están erosionando lentamente, aumentando el riesgo de un colapso financiero futuro.

A pesar de no tener formación científica formal –dejó de estudiarla a los 16 años–, Gauld ha triunfado creando humor accesible sobre temas complejos como física cuántica, multiversos y la naturaleza de la realidad. Su abuelo, biólogo marino, le introdujo en New Scientist durante la infancia, lo que años después le llevó a proponer tiras cómicas a la revista hace una década. Admite que su falta de expertise es una ventaja: le permite calibrar el nivel de los chistes para que cualquiera los entienda, sin hacer sentir estúpido al lector ni requerir un doctorado. Su proceso creativo pasa por leer la revista, seguir científicos en redes, podcasts y apuntar ideas en un cuaderno, buscando una visión 'desenfadada y divertida' de temas serios, respetuosa como una burla cariñosa a un amigo.

Aunque los productos ultraprocesados son conocidos por sus efectos negativos, el especialista subraya que existen otros cuatro tipos de alimentos que pueden generar riesgos neurológicos graves. En primer lugar, aconseja no consumir conservas enlatadas con envases abultados o dañados, ya que podrían estar contaminadas con la bacteria Clostridium botulinum, causante del botulismo, una intoxicación potencialmente mortal que afecta la comunicación entre el cerebro y los músculos. En segundo lugar, recomienda evitar peces tropicales o de arrecife —como la barracuda, el mero o la morena— por el riesgo de presencia de ciguatoxina, una neurotoxina que no se destruye con la cocción y que puede provocar síntomas como mareos, hormigueos o alteraciones sensoriales.

Habitualmente, las restricciones de tráfico aéreo y marítimo sólo se aplicaban cuando el presidente se encontraba en la zona, pero el Servicio Secreto ha instaurado recientemente restricciones permanentes hasta, al menos, octubre del próximo año. Esto ha provocado que aviones sobrevuelen las viviendas desde las 5:30 a.m. hasta las 11 p.m., generando ruido y contaminación, y disminuyendo hasta un 20% el valor de las propiedades afectadas. A lo largo de los años, Trump ha intentado desviar el tráfico aéreo mediante demandas contra el condado y el aeropuerto, algunas de las cuales se resolvieron parcialmente a su favor.

En él se detallan las sanciones por insultos y difamaciones, un aspecto clave para la protección del honor. Los términos prohibidos incluyen insultos sexuales y ataques al honor, como 'puta', 'hija de puta', 'sodomita' y 'cornudo', que eran motivo de multa si se probaban. El Fuero establece que si las palabras eran discutidas en juicio, se debía pagar una multa al demandante si se confirmaba el insulto, y si no se podía probar, se podía jurar sobre la cruz. Esta normativa revela cómo la sociedad medieval valoraba el honor y cómo se gestionaban las disputas verbales en la villa de Madrid.

Basado en interpretaciones bíblicas como las del Génesis o el Deuteronomio, el 'Gran Israel' se describe como una visión que abarca territorios más amplios que los actuales límites de Israel, incluyendo partes del Líbano, Siria, Jordania y Egipto. A lo largo del siglo XX, líderes sionistas como Chaim Weizmann y David Ben-Gurion defendieron la idea de avanzar de forma gradual, consolidando el Estado como plataforma para futuras expansiones.

Según el abogado Miquel Àngel Mas, muchos propietarios se ven obligados a vender por falta de recursos financieros, especialmente en casos de herencias, donde los herederos no pueden permitirse comprar la parte que les correspondería. También las separaciones influyen en estas ventas, ya que cuando los hijos son pequeños, es habitual que uno de los progenitores permanezca en la vivienda, pero los altos precios obligan a vender cuando esta situación termina. Este fenómeno, que comenzó en áreas con alta demanda extranjera, se está extendiendo ahora también a Palma. La venta de propiedades a extranjeros refleja tanto la dinámica del mercado inmobiliario como las dificultades económicas de los propietarios locales para mantener la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/motivos-detras-de-la-venta-de-propiedades-mallorquinas-a-compradores-extranjeros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/motivos-detras-de-la-venta-de-propiedades-mallorquinas-a-compradores-extranjeros</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 21:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dos menores fallecen en el Parque de la Concordia en Jaén; la Policía investiga]]></title><description><![CDATA[En la madrugada del 29 de noviembre de 2025, los servicios de emergencia del 112 informaron del hallazgo de los cuerpos sin vida de dos menores en el Parque de la Concordia, ubicado en Jaén.

Hasta el momento, se desconocen las causas de la muerte de los menores, por lo que se mantienen abiertas todas las hipótesis. La Policía Nacional está al cargo de la investigación, que se encuentra bajo secreto de sumario, impidiendo la divulgación de detalles adicionales. Los cuerpos fueron localizados pasadas las 01:30 horas, y los equipos de emergencias acudieron al lugar inmediatamente.

El establecimiento ocupará más de 400 m² con terraza pública, pagando solo 6.800 euros anuales durante 40 años, lo que ha desatado la indignación en barrios acomodados como Puertochico y el Ensanche, con rentas medias altas y votantes mayoritarios del PP. La alcaldesa Gema Igual, del PP con mayoría absoluta, enfrenta críticas por priorizar la hostelería sobre la convivencia vecinal. Los manifestantes, de perfiles diversos -ancianos, familias, asociaciones vecinales y oposición política-, gritaban 'Gema Igual, el barrio te da igual' y recordaban protestas pasadas como la del Metrobús en 2018. La marcha incluyó representantes de PSOE, IU, Cantabristas y hasta Vox, aunque esta última intentó desmarcarse de banderas palestinas presentes.

López Rodrigo explica que la accesibilidad a la vivienda se está viendo afectada por políticas urbanísticas ineficaces y la especulación inmobiliaria, lo que provoca que muchas familias queden fuera del mercado. Destaca además la necesidad de una intervención pública más eficiente y un cambio en la gestión urbanística para evitar un colapso social y económico. Se abordan también posibles soluciones, que pasan por una revisión de la planificación urbana, fomentar vivienda pública y regulaciones que garanticen el derecho a una vivienda digna para todos. El experto advierte que si no se actúa con decisión, las consecuencias sociales serán muy graves, alertando que en España se está jugando con fuego en el sector de la vivienda.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entrevista-con-jose-manuel-lopez-rodrigo-sobre-la-crisis-de-la-vivienda-y-soluciones-urbanisticas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entrevista-con-jose-manuel-lopez-rodrigo-sobre-la-crisis-de-la-vivienda-y-soluciones-urbanisticas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump presiona a la Unión Europea para reducir la regulación digital a cambio de aliviar los aranceles]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Administración de Donald Trump ha intensificado la presión sobre la Unión Europea, condicionando la reducción de los aranceles estadounidenses al acero y al aluminio europeos a que Bruselas relaje su regulación sobre las grandes tecnológicas como Google, Microsoft o Amazon.

En este contexto, la Comisión Europea ha reiterado que no está dispuesta a modificar su legislación sobre el sector tecnológico, pese a que recientemente propuso un aplazamiento y cierta relajación en la aplicación de la nueva ley de Inteligencia Artificial.

Según el artículo 22 del Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias, los poderes públicos deben garantizar el derecho a una vivienda digna y regular su función social, evitando la especulación. Sin embargo, Canarias cuenta con menos del 1% de vivienda pública, muy por debajo del 19% de media europea, y las medidas adoptadas por el actual Gobierno no parecen abordar el problema de manera efectiva. La negativa a declarar zonas tensionadas, la sanción a propietarios en zonas turísticas y la priorización de la vivienda privada sobre la pública son algunos de los ejemplos que evidencia la falta de acción.

Esta decisión se enmarca en un conflicto que se remonta a 2023, cuando una similar exposición satánica se instaló junto a un belén cristiano, lo que provocó vandalismo por parte de un extremista cristiano, Michael Cassidy, quien se declaró culpable de un delito menor. En lugar de sancionar al agresor, las autoridades republicanas han endurecido las normas: limitaron los eventos a un día al año por grupo y prohibieron contenidos 'obscenos', cambios que parecen dirigidos específicamente contra los satanistas.

Miguel Ángel Simón, director del proyecto europeo Life+ Iberlince, destaca que este logro es fruto de 15 años de trabajo centrados en la reintroducción de ejemplares nacidos en cautividad en su hábitat natural. Desde la primera suelta en Córdoba en 2010 y en Jaén en 2011, se han consolidado poblaciones estables y conectado distintas áreas, lo que permite un intercambio genético fundamental para la supervivencia de la especie.

En julio de 2025 acudió, como cada año, a su cita con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), pero en esta ocasión fue detenida y trasladada primero a una instalación en Maryland y luego a otra en Luisiana.

Basta con una comunicación previa por escrito al presidente o administrador de la comunidad, informando del inicio de las obras y las características técnicas de la instalación.

Esta excepción busca fomentar la movilidad eléctrica ante el creciente número de coches eléctricos, diferenciándose de otras modificaciones en elementos comunes, como el cambio de suelo en terrazas o cerramientos, que sí requieren acuerdo comunitario.

La región continúa enfrentando problemas estructurales como el desempleo, que se mantiene por encima de la media nacional, y un modelo económico dependiente de sectores primarios y turísticos con bajo valor añadido, lo que contribuye a la desigualdad y a la exclusión social. El informe Foessa señala que Andalucía presenta un sistema productivo menos desarrollado, traducido en menor calidad de vida y mayor exclusión, con dificultades especialmente graves para los hogares con ingresos bajos. En cuanto a los servicios públicos esenciales, la sanidad ha experimentado un notable deterioro: las listas de espera se han incrementado, con más de un millón de personas pendientes de atención médica o quirúrgica, y los problemas en programas clave, como la detección precoz del cáncer de mama, han puesto en evidencia la presión sobre ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluacion-de-siete-anos-de-gobierno-de-moreno-bonilla-en-andalucia-sanidad-empleo-y-desigualdad-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluacion-de-siete-anos-de-gobierno-de-moreno-bonilla-en-andalucia-sanidad-empleo-y-desigualdad-social</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacer Nación se disuelve y parte de su dirección pasa a Vox y Solidaridad]]></title><description><![CDATA[La organización neofascista Hacer Nación (HN), creada en 2020 a partir de la unión de diversos colectivos de extrema derecha, ha cesado su actividad según la investigación del blog antifascista Sistema 161.

La celebración de estas jornadas coincidió con un cambio en la estrategia de defensa de Ábalos y García, quienes finalmente ingresaron en prisión tras su implicación en un caso de corrupción relacionado con la compraventa de mascarillas durante la pandemia. El medio organizador, OkDiario, publicó entrevistas exclusivas con los implicados, lo que pone en evidencia la cercanía entre la cobertura mediática, los patrocinadores del evento y los protagonistas del caso.

Hasta ahora solo se conoce el fallo, pero no los fundamentos jurídicos, que serán determinantes para aclarar si la condena se debe a la supuesta filtración de un correo electrónico a los medios la noche del 13 de marzo de 2024 o a la difusión de un comunicado oficial de la Fiscalía al día siguiente. Ambas vías fueron objeto de controversia desde el inicio del proceso, especialmente porque el propio Supremo había sostenido en 2024 que la nota de prensa no podía ser delictiva.

La noticia ha provocado reacciones polarizadas: la derecha política, especialmente el Partido Popular, ha respondido con críticas duras y exigencias de un Fiscal 'apolítico', mientras algunos personajes judiciales y mediáticos parecen haber tenido un papel central en la operación. Según el análisis del artículo, esta condena se inscribe en una estrategia más amplia de la derecha para utilizar el Poder Judicial como herramienta de presión política contra los gobiernos progresistas, recordando la necesidad de reformas que aseguren la preeminencia del Parlamento y del Gobierno frente a órganos judiciales corporativos.

Además, el exmagistrado señala que la sentencia ignora la evidencia de que toda la información cuestionada estuvo en posesión de la fiscalía durante más de un mes y que su primera difusión fue a través de un medio de comunicación.

La investigación, dirigida por Santiago F. González, revela que la tinta de los tatuajes no permanece únicamente en la piel, sino que se desplaza rápidamente hacia los ganglios linfáticos, acumulándose en grandes cantidades. Los macrófagos, células inmunitarias responsables de eliminar agentes extraños, capturan activamente los pigmentos de la tinta, lo que provoca una respuesta inflamatoria en dos fases: una fase aguda de aproximadamente dos días y una fase crónica que puede durar años. Esta acumulación repetida y la muerte de macrófagos pueden debilitar la capacidad del sistema inmunitario, aumentando la vulnerabilidad frente a infecciones y ciertos tipos de cáncer.

Allí permaneció hasta que fue detenido en septiembre en San Pedro de Macorís, en una operación coordinada entre la Policía dominicana y la Interpol. La captura se produjo a petición de las autoridades españolas, que habían emitido una orden internacional de detención y solicitaban su extradición.

El autor subraya que la polarización no es un fenómeno nuevo ni exclusivo de la era digital, sino una constante de la naturaleza humana que se ha adaptado a distintos contextos. En la actualidad, señala que la crispación política ha adoptado nuevas formas, donde los partidos premian la lealtad sobre la experiencia y los ciudadanos participan en disputas simbólicas a través de redes sociales y medios de comunicación. Como metáfora de serenidad en medio de este caos, el artículo utiliza a Jordi Hurtado, presentador de televisión, cuya constancia y neutralidad contrastan con la volatilidad del debate público.

Este ritual, que se practica principalmente en Bombay por la comunidad parsi, se basa en creencias religiosas que consideran sagrados los elementos naturales y ven la excarnación como un acto de caridad y respeto ecológico. La torre tiene tres anillos diferenciados según género y edad donde se colocan los cadáveres, los cuales son descompuestos por aves carroñeras y luego los huesos se depositan en un pozo central para su desintegración final, con un sistema para purificar el agua filtrada. En Irán, la práctica está prohibida desde los años 70 por motivos sanitarios, y las torres se conservan como patrimonio histórico.

Además, la vivienda protegida ha caído de un 20% a un mínimo del 7,39% en 2024, generando un déficit crónico que limita el acceso a viviendas asequibles. El estudio concluye que la crisis inmobiliaria no se debe a la falta de pisos, sino a la escasez de vivienda pública y protegida, lo que encarece los precios en el mercado libre y retrasa la emancipación juvenil.

Durante un acto en Barcelona, presentado por Josep Sánchez Llibre, Feijóo ha dejado claro que no le faltan ganas, sino votos, especialmente 'de los suyos', refiriéndose a los empresarios que podrían influir en los independentistas. La propuesta es una moción técnica con un único compromiso: convocar elecciones generales para que los españoles decidan el futuro Gobierno. Feijóo ha insistido en que es una constatación, no una crítica, y ha apelado directamente a los asistentes, muchos de los cuales cree que votaron a Junts o ERC. No es la primera vez que intenta esta maniobra; ya lo hizo en mayo tras el encarcelamiento de Santos Cerdán, en enero y en 2023 durante su investidura fallida.

Según The Washington Post, el ataque inicial dejó con vida a dos personas que permanecían aferradas a los restos del bote, pero un segundo bombardeo —supuestamente ordenado por el almirante Mitch Bradley, jefe del Mando de Operaciones Especiales— habría tenido como objetivo impedir que pidieran ayuda a otros traficantes. Hegseth afirmó en la red social X que se trató de “golpes letales y cinéticos” y defendió que todas las operaciones en la zona cumplen la legislación estadounidense e internacional, así como el derecho de los conflictos armados.

Según Piga, Franco murió a lo largo del 19 de noviembre de 1975, y su fallecimiento se anunció oficialmente horas después, el 20 de noviembre, a través de la comunicación de Carlos Arias Navarro. El forense recuerda que al llegar al Hospital de La Paz alrededor de las 23:30 horas, Franco ya llevaba varias horas muerto. Piga también compartió detalles del proceso de embalsamamiento, incluyendo la custodia de dos maletas negras con el material necesario durante un mes, y su labor durante la exposición del cadáver en la capilla ardiente, controlando incluso la condensación que se formó en el cuerpo.

El grupo dominante, Kahama, se dividió en facciones, desencadenando una serie de enfrentamientos estratégicos por el control territorial. Las emboscadas, asesinatos selectivos y la vigilancia de fronteras eran tácticas habituales de los chimpancés, que demostraban inteligencia y planificación en sus ataques. La investigación sugiere que el aumento del número de machos frente a hembras fue un factor clave en el inicio de la guerra. Tras casi cuatro años, el clan Kasakela emergió como vencedor, eliminando a los machos más fuertes de la facción rival y absorbiendo a los más débiles. No obstante, esta victoria tuvo un alto coste, ya que el clan sobreviviente quedó debilitado y perdió parte de su territorio frente a otros grupos vecinos.

Hernández fue declarado culpable en 2024 por tráfico de drogas, tenencia ilícita de armas y por utilizar dinero procedente del narcotráfico para influir en las elecciones hondureñas de 2013 y 2017. Su condena se basó, en gran medida, en los testimonios de varios narcotraficantes que aseguraron haber sobornado al exmandatario. 

El anuncio de Trump se produjo a través de Truth Social, donde también reiteró su apoyo a Nasry 'Tito' Asfura, candidato presidencial del conservador Partido Nacional de Honduras. Según Trump, el respaldo estadounidense al país centroamericano dependerá directamente de la victoria de Asfura.

Stenger sostiene que la existencia de Dios, especialmente el dios de las religiones monoteístas, genera efectos observables que violan leyes físicas, por lo que debe someterse a pruebas científicas. Experimentos como ensayos de doble ciego sobre la eficacia de la oración han fallado en mostrar beneficios, e incluso han indicado efectos negativos en algunos casos. Estudios sobre experiencias cercanas a la muerte, con mensajes ocultos en quirófanos, no han encontrado verificación de salidas extracorpóreas. La evolución biológica explica la vida sin intervención divina, las neurociencias ligan la mente al cerebro, y la moral humana tiene raíces evolutivas observadas en primates.

Desde la llegada del primer iPhone en 2008, los precios de los smartphones de marcas líderes como Apple y Samsung han aumentado más rápido que los salarios, alcanzando en 2025 niveles que suponen entre el 57% y el 62% del salario mediano. Marcas chinas como Xiaomi han ofrecido alternativas más económicas, que apenas requieren entre el 12% y el 14% del sueldo mensual, acercando los smartphones de gama media a un público más amplio. La estrategia de las marcas de posicionarse en la gama alta y la inclusión de tecnologías avanzadas, junto con los costes de fabricación, I+D y logística, han contribuido al incremento de precios. La polarización del mercado se refleja en que los modelos más caros, como el Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design, alcanzan los 3.499 euros, mientras que otros como el Redmi Note 14 se mantienen accesibles.

La renuncia se produce tras una investigación de la Oficina Nacional Anticorrupción de Ucrania (NABU) que vincula a Yermak con una trama de sobornos en la empresa estatal de energía nuclear Energoatom, conocida como 'caso Midas'. Según la investigación, la red habría blanqueado al menos 100 millones de dólares mediante el cobro de comisiones ilegales a empresas contratistas, en connivencia con altos funcionarios, entre ellos los ministros de Energía y Justicia. El presunto cerebro de la operación sería el empresario Timur Mindich, antiguo socio de Zelenski, que ha huido del país. Las filtraciones apuntan a que Yermak, apodado 'Alí Babá' por los investigadores, habría recibido beneficios directos de la red.

Aunque Vilaplana aseguró en su declaración que no prestó atención a las llamadas y mensajes de Mazón, la magistrada considera “altamente improbable” que no escuchara parte de las conversaciones, dado el reducido tamaño del reservado del restaurante El Ventorro, de unos 16 metros cuadrados. La periodista ha cambiado varias veces la versión sobre sus movimientos esa tarde, incluyendo la hora de salida y un paseo hasta el aparcamiento junto a Mazón. La jueza también rechaza investigar a Vilaplana por falso testimonio, recordando que para ello es necesario contar con una verdad procesalmente establecida.

Microsoft ha reconocido públicamente que múltiples componentes esenciales, como el menú de inicio, la barra de tareas y el explorador de archivos, presentan fallos estructurales generalizados que afectan gravemente la experiencia del usuario. Estos problemas tienen su origen en la corrupción de los paquetes XAML, que coordinan la interfaz gráfica, y provocan bloqueos frecuentes de procesos críticos del sistema. Los fallos comenzaron a manifestarse tras las actualizaciones acumulativas de julio de 2025 y afectan a las versiones 24H2 y 25H2 de Windows 11, incluso en instalaciones nuevas, descartando problemas de configuraciones antiguas. Microsoft ofrece un parche temporal mediante un script de PowerShell, aunque esta solución resulta poco práctica para usuarios sin conocimientos técnicos.

Los actos vandálicos, registrados durante los últimos dos años, ascienden a un perjuicio económico de más de 550.000 euros. La policía catalana detuvo a once personas por 34 delitos que suman 99.043 euros en daños, mientras que la Policía Nacional arrestó a nueve más por 94 delitos con un coste de 455.660 euros. Los investigadores destacan además el impacto medioambiental de estos actos, dado que la limpieza de grafitis requiere productos químicos y lavados a presión que aumentan el consumo de agua y energía. Los grafiteros accedían a las estaciones por zonas no habilitadas y cambiaban horarios y días para evitar ser capturados, firmando sus obras con seudónimos o “tags”.

La obra combina rigor histórico con narrativa ágil, explorando la evasión de capitales, la actuación de la policía y los jueces, y las repercusiones internacionales del caso, incluyendo España, Suiza y Estados Unidos. Faes destaca la complejidad de los personajes y la interacción entre poder político y económico en los siglos XIX y XX, abordando dilemas morales y decisiones políticas cruciales en la época. El historiador subraya la importancia de investigar a fondo en archivos y fuentes, evitando simplificaciones y reduccionismos, y ofrece un relato que contextualiza la modernización de la policía franquista, la diplomacia suiza y los circuitos financieros internacionales.

'Usted ha dicho que Rusia debería pagar por la reconstrucción de Ucrania, ¿cree que Israel debería pagar por la reconstrucción de Gaza?', le preguntó Intxaurrondo. Kallas respondió invocando el derecho internacional: 'Quien causa los daños tiene que compensar esos daños'.

Junto a Fede Valverde, creó una sincronía que desmontó la teoría de que las estrellas complican la labor del entrenador, demostrando que el buen juego surge de planteamientos tácticos acertados y de mantener a los jugadores clave en el campo.

Más tarde, el bloque fue vendido a tres compañías con sede en Barcelona. En 2023, el Ayuntamiento de València, gobernado por PP y Vox, aprobó una licencia de cambio de uso del inmueble de residencial a hotelero, a pesar de que aún quedaban cuatro viviendas habitadas. Después de insistentes reclamaciones vecinales, la licencia hotelera caducó y fue anulada, aunque el consistorio otorgó una nueva para una reforma integral del edificio.

La iniciativa la presentó el concejal no adscrito José Ramón Conesa, expulsado de Vox en 2024 por abstenerse en la votación de los presupuestos municipales. Conesa justificó su propuesta acusando a Sánchez de pactar con 'los asesinos y herederos de ETA', de inutilidad en la gestión de la pandemia y la DANA, y de corrupción crónica. Durante su intervención en el pleno, lució una insignia con la bandera franquista en la solapa y gemelos con el yugo y las flechas de Falange Española, símbolos preconstitucionales que generaron polémica. La moción contó con los votos a favor del PP y Vox, pese a que Conesa ya no milita en este último partido.

Yermak ha declarado que está colaborando plenamente con las autoridades, aunque aún se desconoce si será formalmente investigado. El caso Midas se centra en grabaciones de Timur Mindich, socio de Zelenski en la productora Kvartal 95, que sugieren desvíos de fondos en varios ministerios, especialmente en Energía, con pérdidas estimadas en más de 85 millones de euros. Anteriormente, se registró el domicilio de Mindich y de otros funcionarios como German Galushchenko y Oleksii Chernishov, este último ya acusado formalmente.

Con el apoyo a Nasry Asfura, candidato del Partido Nacional y vinculado a casos de narcotráfico, Trump busca influir en el resultado electoral de un país en el que su apuesta por Asfura ha sido criticada. Trump ya había usado una estrategia similar en Argentina al respaldar al conservador Javier Milei, pero en el caso de Honduras su apoyo se ha sumado a una campaña en la que el liberal Salvador Nasralla lideraba las encuestas. La intervención de Trump ha puesto en duda el apoyo de los votantes indecisos, mientras que Asfura ha agradecido públicamente la intervención de Washington. En el otro extremo, Rixi Moncada, la candidata oficialista, se ha distanciado de las acusaciones de ser comunista, una etiqueta que se le ha asignado por su cercanía a los gobiernos de izquierda latinoamericanos.

A los ocho años sufrió abusos sexuales por parte de un religioso marista mientras acudía a catequesis en el colegio La Inmaculada de Valladolid, en 1974. Según relata, el agresor empezó a acosarla desde el primer día y la culpabilizó de los hechos, provocándole una profunda vergüenza y miedo. Durante años vivió atrapada en el trauma, con episodios de amnesia, sentimientos de culpa y pensamientos suicidas en la adolescencia. No fue hasta los cuarenta cuando comprendió que no tenía ninguna responsabilidad en lo sucedido. Tras un largo proceso de terapia, Paula colabora hoy con la Asociación Nacional Infancia Robada (ANIR) para apoyar a otras víctimas.

Las indagaciones señalan como responsable de organizar estos llamados “safaris humanos” a Jovica Stanisic, entonces jefe de la Dirección de Seguridad del Estado de Serbia. Distintas fuentes judiciales y periodísticas revelan que Stanisic no solo era un alto cargo bajo el régimen de Slobodan Milosevic, sino también un agente de la CIA estadounidense, reclutado en 1991 por el agente William Lofgren. Según documentos clasificados presentados en su juicio, Stanisic colaboró con la inteligencia de Estados Unidos proporcionando información sobre el régimen serbio, localizando fosas comunes y ayudando en operaciones de liberación de rehenes de la OTAN. A pesar de ese vínculo, fue condenado en 2021 a 15 años de prisión por crímenes de guerra en Bosnia y Herzegovina.

En el norte, el gobierno islandés ha elevado el posible colapso de la Circulación de Retorno Meridional del Atlántico (AMOC) a la categoría de asunto de seguridad nacional. Esta corriente oceánica es clave en la regulación climática global, y su debilitamiento podría causar un enfriamiento severo en el norte de Europa mientras el resto del planeta continúa calentándose. Investigadores como Stefan Rahmstorf consideran el debilitamiento de la AMOC una evidencia irrefutable y advierten de que su colapso podría ocurrir en este siglo, generando episodios meteorológicos extremos sin precedentes en Europa. 

Por otro lado, el texto describe la dramática situación de Irán, donde la sequía extrema ha llevado al presidente Masoud Pezeshkian a proponer el traslado de la capital fuera de Teherán, una ciudad que ya carece de recursos hídricos suficientes.

La infraestructura de protección infantil en las islas está saturada, con cerca de 6,000 menores no acompañados alojados en centros. Investigaciones policiales recientes han llevado a la detención de once personas implicadas en estas redes, que utilizaban documentos falsificados y transporte no detectado para movilizar a las víctimas.

Se manifiesta en una disminución considerable en la atención, dificultad para realizar tareas complejas, pérdida de memoria a corto plazo y un pensamiento simplificado. Esta condición, alimentada por la adicción al uso constante de dispositivos móviles, afecta la salud mental y contribuye a la disminución de la capacidad crítica y al aumento del anti-intelectualismo. Además, el 'brain rot' sirve al capitalismo como una herramienta para alienar a la población, transformando a las personas en meros consumidores cuyo sentido de identidad se basa en lo que compran o consumen, reforzando así el vínculo entre identidad personal y consumo. Esto resulta en la pérdida de independiente mental y en una sociedad cada vez más manipulable.

Nueve eurodiputados socialistas apoyaron el reglamento, pese a que otros compañeros de su propia delegación votaron en contra o se abstuvieron, y uno de ellos alegó haber votado a favor por error. La propuesta del Partido Popular Europeo, respaldada también por Vox, pretendía frenar esa modificación del etiquetado para evitar sortear las sentencias del Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea, que ha dictaminado que el Sáhara no forma parte de Marruecos.

Según sus declaraciones a Newsweek, se prevé que los precios de las viviendas se reduzcan hasta en un 50 % en los próximos años, empezando a caer con fuerza el año que viene. Wright señala que esta tendencia se debe principalmente al aumento del inventario, la disminución de la demanda y el estancamiento de la accesibilidad, ya que los altos costes de las hipotecas, los impuestos y los seguros continúan excluyendo a millones de estadounidenses del mercado inmobiliario. 

Los datos recientes respaldan esta visión pesimista: más de la mitad de las viviendas del país perdieron valor durante el último año, el mayor descenso desde 2012. Aunque el crecimiento de precios se ha ralentizado, muchas propiedades siguen muy por encima de los niveles anteriores a la pandemia.

Además, los gastos anuales de mantenimiento, seguro y otros servicios específicos suman entre 1.500 y 2.500 euros. Comparando con diferentes opciones de vacaciones, se estima que con el precio de compra de una camper (40.000 euros) se podrían financiar 40 a 57 años de vacaciones mochileras en Europa, de 14 a 7 años en hoteles de lujo en Bali, y entre 32 y 14 años en alojamientos de Airbnb en España.

Ayuso apareció con una cazadora reflectante, rodeada de maquinaria de limpieza y preparación invernal, pero su discurso se centró en temas políticos y polémicos como Bildu, ETA y la gestión del Gobierno central, en lugar de centrarse en los problemas concretos de los ciudadanos durante la temporada de nieve y heladas.

Dirigió unas palabras también hacia periodistas que atraviesan incertidumbres laborales, animándoles a persistir y recordándoles que este Ondas demuestra que “se puede volver a empezar”. Pero lo más significativo vino al final: en un alegato antirracista, Nierga expresó su deseo de que en el futuro los premiados tengan nombres como Salma, Usman o Mohamed, como símbolo de una sociedad más inclusiva y diversa, donde triunfen quienes muchos quieren expulsar. Esa declaración fue recibida con fuertes aplausos en el auditorio y marca un gesto claro de respaldo a la inmigración y la convivencia, además de un rechazo a discur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gemma-nierga-reivindica-la-diversidad-e-inclusividad-en-los-premios-ondas-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gemma-nierga-reivindica-la-diversidad-e-inclusividad-en-los-premios-ondas-2025</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un tribunal reconoce el derecho de familias musulmanas en Mallorca a que sus hijos reciban clases de religión islámica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Baleares (TSJB) ha reconocido el derecho de cinco madres musulmanas en Mallorca a que sus hijos puedan recibir clases de religión islámica en sus colegios, incluso en centros de ideario católico. La sentencia responde a la demanda de una madre de origen magrebí, llamada Yamira (nombre ficticio), que tras un año de silencio administrativo por parte de la Consejería de Educación decidió acudir a los tribunales. El TSJB considera que la negativa o falta de respuesta vulnera el artículo 27.3 de la Constitución Española, que garantiza a los padres el derecho a que sus hijos reciban formación religiosa y moral conforme a sus convicciones. Según J. Nur Bió, portavoz de la Asociación Musulmana de las Islas Baleares (AMMU), cada vez hay más familias en las islas que reclaman este tipo de docencia, amparadas por la legislación y por los acuerdos entre el Estado y la Comisión Islámica de España.

Aunque el dictador lideró una dictadura sangrienta que dejó miles de muertos, muchas personas, sobre todo jóvenes, tienen una visión distorsionada de su impacto positivo en la historia del país. La educación sobre la dictadura franquista ha sido deficiente, lo que contribuye a una falta de conciencia sobre los horrores de esa época. En la actualidad, muchos jóvenes piensan que Franco fue beneficioso para España, sin entender las consecuencias de su régimen autoritario, represivo y violento. El historiador Giles Tremlett alerta sobre esta tendencia y subraya la importancia de romper el silencio en torno a la dictadura y enseñar la verdadera historia a las nuevas generaciones. A pesar de los avances democráticos, aún existen narrativas que intentan justificar o incluso venerar a Franco, lo que subraya la necesidad de una educación más profunda sobre el franquismo y su legado de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vision-de-franco-en-espana-una-falta-de-conocimiento-historico-que-pone-en-riesgo-el-futuro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vision-de-franco-en-espana-una-falta-de-conocimiento-historico-que-pone-en-riesgo-el-futuro</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 11:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adolf Hitler Uunona, un político namibio, se acerca a ganar las elecciones regionales en Namibia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adolf Hitler Uunona, un político veterano de Namibia, está a punto de ganar unas elecciones regionales en el distrito de Ompundja, donde goza de gran popularidad. A pesar del peculiar nombre que comparte con el dictador nazi, Uunona insiste en que su nombre es una coincidencia histórica, ya que Namibia fue colonia alemana hasta 1915. Su padre lo eligió sin conocer el peso del homónimo europeo. Uunona, de 59 años, ha sido un activista destacado en la lucha anti-apartheid y por la independencia de Namibia. En su carrera política se ha centrado en el desarrollo local, infraestructuras y programas comunitarios. En las últimas elecciones de 2020, obtuvo una victoria arrolladora con un 85% de los votos, y su partido espera una nueva victoria, aunque con un apoyo algo menor. A pesar de los logros políticos de Uunona, el foco de atención sigue siendo su nombre, algo que le resulta incómodo, ya que considera que se habla más de ello que de las verdaderas necesidades de su comunidad.

Esta nueva norma, que también afecta a los ciclomotores y motocicletas, busca mejorar la movilidad y evitar vehículos abandonados o sin seguro. La concejala de Vías Públicas, Blanca Hernández, ha señalado que la medida tiene como objetivo garantizar una ciudad más ordenada y eficiente. Sin embargo, los grupos de oposición han mostrado su preocupación por la eficacia de los controles y la seguridad jurídica de las sanciones. Además, algunos han cuestionado la viabilidad de implementar la ordenanza sin la disponibilidad de aparcamientos disuasorios.

El vídeo parece ser una metáfora política, pero la reacción pública ha sido de puro desconcierto, ya que muchos lo consideran un intento de atraer atención sin una base seria. Este tipo de estrategias, que se asemejan a las utilizadas por otros líderes ultraderechistas, como Javier Milei en Argentina, parece estar siendo adoptado por Vox en un intento de amplificar su mensaje a través del humor y el espectáculo.

El tribunal también ha condenado a otros 13 directivos y a la propia empresa Hafesa, mientras que ha absuelto a ocho empleados. El caso gira en torno a una compleja organización que defraudó 154 millones de euros mediante un sistema de evasión del IVA en operaciones comerciales con combustibles. La sentencia, de 450 páginas, considera probado que los acusados usaron empresas pantalla para eludir las obligaciones tributarias y aumentar su beneficio mediante la incorporación del IVA repercutido al patrimonio empresarial.

Esta visita se enmarca en la estrategia del Gobierno por acelerar la compra de trenes ante el aumento de la demanda de viajeros. Según el Ministerio, se trata de un proceso similar al de otras visitas a empresas europeas como Siemens o Hitachi. Sin embargo, la idea no está exenta de polémica.

La junta militar que gobierna desde los golpes de Estado de 2020 y 2021 no ha conseguido frenar el avance del Grupo de Apoyo al Islam y a los Musulmanes (JNIM), vinculado a Al Qaeda, que ha impuesto un bloqueo económico sobre la capital, Bamako. Este grupo ataca convoyes de combustible y paraliza el suministro energético, lo que ha provocado colas kilométricas, cierre de escuelas y escasez de alimentos y medicinas. La situación ha generado un clima de asfixia social y política que amenaza la estabilidad del país y de toda la región del Sahel.

El conflicto ha provocado un aumento del flujo migratorio hacia Europa, especialmente hacia las Islas Canarias, situadas a apenas 800 kilómetros.

Entre los contratos destaca la compra de cincuenta helicópteros ligeros multipropósito, la modernización de sistemas de artillería antiaérea y la adquisición de nuevos aviones para sustituir el modelo Aviocar, tres proyectos que en conjunto alcanzan más del 85% del gasto total autorizado. Pese a la magnitud del desembolso, el Gobierno no ofreció detalles públicos sobre estas operaciones, que no se mencionaron ni en la rueda de prensa posterior al Consejo de Ministros ni en la nota difundida por Moncloa.

Según la denuncia, Arrieta empleó un tono jocoso, pero los Comuns consideran que esta conducta evidencia que existía ya una mayoría formada y un cambio de ponencia, revelando así deliberaciones internas del tribunal.

La provincia más afectada es Alicante, con un 98,9% de su territorio en riesgo, seguida de Valencia con un 81,9%, mientras que Castellón es la menos afectada con un 57,7%. Las áreas centrales y litorales, especialmente aquellas con sobreexplotación agrícola y fuerte desarrollo turístico, sufren un mayor deterioro. Entre los factores humanos que impulsan esta situación destacan el uso intensivo del agua, la acumulación de residuos agrícolas y una gestión hídrica inadecuada en algunas comarcas. Los expertos recomiendan medidas como la reutilización del agua, la desalinizacion, la recuperación de acuíferos y, en último caso, el trasvase de agua.

El estudio, publicado en la revista Science Advances, demuestra que un conjunto de conexiones que va desde el núcleo accumbens hasta el hipotálamo, y de éste a la habénula lateral, puede provocar que los ratones realicen acciones repetitivas como cavar o olfatear incluso cuando disponen de comida u otras recompensas. El núcleo accumbens forma parte del sistema de recompensa, mientras que la habénula lateral procesa experiencias negativas, lo que sugiere que la interacción entre ambas zonas puede alterar el equilibrio entre motivación y comportamiento repetitivo.

Según Pradas, Mazón se limitó a pedir que le mantuviera informado y no reveló dónde se encontraba, aunque se sabe que pasó buena parte del día en una comida con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana. La entrevista, la primera desde la tragedia, aportará lo que la exconsellera define como “detalles exclusivos” sobre la gestión de la emergencia que acabó con 229 muertos. En ella, Pradas también rebate críticas sobre supuestos retrasos: niega que la reunión del centro de coordinación (CECOPI) se convocara tarde y defiende que el envío de la alerta pública (ES-Alert) no se demoró por esperar al president, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pradas-declara-que-mazon-no-mostro-preocupacion-tras-ser-avisado-del-riesgo-en-utiel-durante-la-dana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pradas-declara-que-mazon-no-mostro-preocupacion-tras-ser-avisado-del-riesgo-en-utiel-durante-la-dana</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 21:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hospital Virgen del Rocío aún sin reforzar plantilla dos meses después de los fallos en cribados de cáncer de mama]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hace dos meses estalló un grave escándalo sanitario en Andalucía tras descubrirse fallos en los cribados de cáncer de mama que afectaron a 2.317 mujeres, dejando sin diagnóstico ni tratamiento a las pacientes durante meses. La Junta de Andalucía, tras ceses y dimisiones de altos cargos, anunció un plan de choque que prometía la contratación de 119 nuevos profesionales, incluidos 65 radiólogos y 18 técnicos especialistas, así como la creación de una Unidad de Cáncer de Mama en el Hospital Virgen del Rocío de Sevilla. Sin embargo, a día de hoy, apenas se ha incorporado un radiólogo nuevo y otro a tiempo parcial, y la unidad prometida aún no se ha implementado. Para cumplir con las pruebas pendientes, el hospital ha tenido que recurrir a horas extra del personal ya existente. La única promesa cumplida hasta ahora ha sido la realización de las mamografías a todas las mujeres afectadas, gracias al esfuerzo adicional de los radiólogos en plantilla.

Los testimonios describen ataques a civiles desarmados y demolición masiva de viviendas, dejando gran parte de Gaza devastada. Los soldados relatan que se les ordenó ignorar el derecho internacional y emplear civiles, incluidos niños, como escudos humanos mediante un procedimiento denominado 'Protocolo Mosquito'. Este método consistía en forzar a palestinos detenidos a entrar en zonas potencialmente peligrosas, como túneles o edificios con riesgo de explosión, para proteger a las tropas israelíes. Algunos soldados, como Eli y Daniel, detallaron cómo las órdenes se daban al margen de reglas formales de enfrentamiento, basándose en la interpretación de los comandantes de cada situación.

Durante el incidente, se abalanzó sobre el doctor con intención de agredirlo, siendo detenido a tiempo por un agente de la Guardia Civil. La confesión de los hechos le permitió al acusado beneficiarse de una reducción de la pena inicialmente solicitada de seis años. Además de la prisión, deberá pagar 6.000 euros en concepto de indemnización a la víctima, con una parte ya consignada antes del juicio, y una multa de 240 euros por lesiones y amenazas.

Desde foros como Reddit, Forocoches o Burbuja.info hasta chats privados en Telegram o WhatsApp, este movimiento construye una red de comunicación que normaliza actitudes misóginas y antifeministas. Según la doctora Rosario Lacalle, los incels se caracterizan por un victimismo sexual y una idealización de la masculinidad tradicional, y justifican su desprecio hacia las mujeres con una narrativa de inferioridad y frustración.

Aquella misma tarde, un hombre fue arrollado por un tren en la estación de la ciudad, pero la policía nunca relacionó ambos hechos, a pesar de que ocurrieron a escasos metros y en el mismo día. El cadáver presentaba un tatuaje de una rosa de los vientos y la letra J, además de una postal dirigida a 'José Antonio', pero la investigación fue tan deficiente que el caso quedó sin resolver durante 37 años. La madre del joven, Josefa, acudió durante años a comisarías y medios de comunicación, sin obtener respuestas. En 2024, un nuevo equipo de la Policía Nacional revisó el expediente y logró identificarlo mediante un cotejo dactiloscópico con la huella original de su DNI conservada en Madrid.

La denuncia, presentada por una autodenominada 'Comisión Sanitaria contra el Antisemitismo', era anónima y fue difundida por el medio Enfoque Judío antes de su verificación formal, lo que generó preocupación por la falta de garantías y la divulgación mediática previa a la notificación al profesional.

Según el barómetro de la Asociación de Usuarios Financieros (Asufin), casi el 48% de los préstamos se destinan a comprar una segunda residencia con fines de inversión, mientras que solo el 15,9% corresponde a la compra de la primera vivienda. Este fenómeno refleja el peso del mercado inmobiliario como refugio de valor y como vía para obtener rentabilidad mediante el alquiler o la reventa. El estudio también muestra que, aunque la proporción de hipotecas para invertir ha caído desde el 56,2% al 47,7% entre febrero y noviembre de 2025, sigue liderando ampliamente las motivaciones para endeudarse. La subida de los tipos de interés, que llegaron al 4,5% en 2023, y la inflación elevada han modificado el comportamiento de los compradores, impulsando el interés por hipotecas a tipo fijo, que ahora promedian un 2,87%, frente a las mixt]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-48-de-las-hipotecas-en-espana-se-destinan-a-inversion-inmobiliaria-segun-asufin</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-48-de-las-hipotecas-en-espana-se-destinan-a-inversion-inmobiliaria-segun-asufin</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 19:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pulpo y gallano muestran una colaboración inusual en los fondos de las islas Cíes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un documental submarino ha captado una escena inédita en los fondos marinos de las islas Cíes, donde un pulpo común (Octopus vulgaris) y un pez gallano (Labrus mixtus) interactúan con sorprendente cooperación para buscar alimento.

La obra profundiza en los orígenes del grupo, desde su primer proyecto indie, Darlin’, hasta la creación de su identidad robótica y el impacto global de discos como 'Homework', 'Discovery' o 'Random Access Memories'.

Aunque mantiene la disciplina fiscal para no aumentar la deuda pública, el Gobierno no consigue apagar la crisis política ni reforzar el liderazgo del primer ministro. El plan fiscal, que grava principalmente a rentas medias y altas, busca enviar un mensaje de responsabilidad a inversores y Bruselas, pero la percepción pública es negativa, con servicios públicos colapsados y dificultades diarias para la ciudadanía. Las medidas sociales anunciadas son insuficientes para cambiar la experiencia de la población, y la falta de una visión clara de crecimiento económico aumenta la inestabilidad política. El auge del populismo de derecha radical liderado por Nigel Farage añade presión al Gobierno, que también]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-presupuesto-de-starmer-apunta-a-estabilizar-la-economia-en-un-reino-unido-en-crisis-politica-y-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-presupuesto-de-starmer-apunta-a-estabilizar-la-economia-en-un-reino-unido-en-crisis-politica-y-social</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 16:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pérez Llorca afronta su investidura tras recibir un requerimiento judicial por la DANA de 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[Juanfran Pérez Llorca, portavoz de la Generalitat Valenciana y sucesor de Carlos Mazón, recibió un requerimiento judicial el miércoles previo a su investidura como presidente autonómico. La Policía Local de Valencia acudió a Les Corts para entregarle documentación vinculada a la investigación sobre la gestión de la DANA del 29 de octubre de 2024, instruida por la jueza de Catarroja. En aquel momento, Pérez Llorca no se encontraba en el edificio y la entrega tuvo que realizarse posteriormente en el hemiciclo con acuse de recibo. El dirigente popular ya había manifestado su disposición a colaborar con la justicia aportando la factura de su teléfono corporativo del Ayuntamiento de Finestrat para verificar el sentido de las llamadas realizadas ese día.

El objetivo principal es combatir la obsolescencia programada y alargar la vida útil de las cosas para reducir el consumo de recursos naturales y las emisiones de CO2. En un contexto de sobreconsumo impulsado por eventos como el Black Friday, esta iniciativa promueve la economía circular priorizando la reducción y reutilización por encima del reciclaje, que no es suficiente si el ritmo de producción sigue aumentando [web:1][web:2].

El informe Alargascencia 2024, publicado por la ONG, destaca el impacto ambiental de prolongar la vida de dispositivos tecnológicos.

Desconcertado, pidió disculpas y trató de corregirse, pero la presidenta de la Cámara, Francina Armengol, le cortó el turno antes de que pudiera aclarar el nombre correcto, 'Anatomía de un farsante', en alusión irónica a la obra 'Anatomía de un instante' de Javier Cercas.

Para los investigadores, ambos elementos refuerzan la hipótesis de que García tenía un papel activo en el manejo de dinero no bancarizado, que podría estar relacionado con el supuesto cobro de comisiones vinculadas a contratos públicos.

A pesar de este desliz, sus diputados lo aplaudieron, siguiendo la dinámica habitual de apoyo incondicional.

Según datos de la red cartográfica brasileña MapBiomas, desde 1985 se han perdido más de 52 millones de hectáreas de selva, una superficie superior al territorio de España. Esta destrucción representa un descenso del 13% de la vegetación original en apenas cuatro décadas. La ganadería extensiva y la expansión de cultivos como la soja son las principales causas de esta deforestación acelerada. Los pastos destinados al ganado pasaron de 12,3 millones de hectáreas en 1985 a más de 56 millones en 2024, lo que supone un crecimiento del 355%. Además, la minería ilegal, especialmente del oro, agrava el problema al utilizar mercurio para separar el metal, contaminando el agua y afectando gravemente a la fauna, la flora y las comunidades indígenas locales. Organizaciones como Greenpeace alertan de que el bosque amazónico está sometido a un nivel de estrés insostenible que afecta incluso al equilibrio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/grave-deterioro-del-amazonas-la-deforestacion-y-la-mineria-destruyen-millones-de-hectareas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/grave-deterioro-del-amazonas-la-deforestacion-y-la-mineria-destruyen-millones-de-hectareas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 10:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Parlamento andaluz admite a trámite una iniciativa ciudadana crítica con el modelo sanitario del PP]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Parlamento andaluz ha aprobado la toma en consideración de una Iniciativa Legislativa Popular (ILP) impulsada por 60.000 firmas ciudadanas, promovida por la asociación Mareas Blancas, que busca recuperar la calidad de la sanidad pública y limitar la privatización en Andalucía. La propuesta plantea restringir los conciertos con hospitales privados, recuperar la subasta de fármacos y revertir medidas que favorecen a la sanidad privada, en un contexto marcado por la crisis de los cribados de cáncer que afectó a más de 2.000 mujeres. A pesar de tener mayoría absoluta, el PP, liderado por Juan Manuel Moreno, ha decidido permitir la tramitación de la ILP, tras la presión social y mediática. La oposición ha criticado la medida como un gesto táctico de cara a las elecciones de primavera de 2026, mientras que Mareas Blancas considera que la aceptación de la iniciativa muestra la debilidad del Gobierno ante la creciente contestación ciudadana.

Este incremento ha repercutido directamente en el chocolate que se vende en los supermercados, donde muchos productos presentan menor contenido de cacao y un aumento de azúcares y grasas más económicas, como el aceite de palma. La reduflación también se ha generalizado: se venden tabletas más pequeñas al mismo precio o incluso más caro. A pesar de que el cacao tiene reconocidos beneficios para la salud, como efecto cardioprotector, mejora cognitiva y antioxidante, el exceso de azúcar y las grasas trans presentes en muchos productos comerciales pueden contrarrestar estos beneficios. Productos populares como Kit-Kat, ColaCao, Nocilla o bombones comerciales contienen cantidades elevadas de azúcar y grasas no saludables, aunque mantengan cierta cantidad de cacao.

Los recursos destinados por Madrid se sitúan 10 puntos por debajo de la media nacional y hasta 42 puntos por debajo del País Vasco, que encabeza la inversión. Las autonomías forales, como País Vasco y Navarra, presentan un gasto superior debido a su financiación privilegiada. En Madrid, la combinación de una renta per cápita elevada, decisiones políticas orientadas a la reducción de impuestos y la preferencia de la población por servicios privados explica su menor gasto público.

Desde abril, 71 familias de diversas localidades catalanas realizaron una huelga de alquileres, dejando de pagar un total de 257.631 euros, como medida de presión para impedir la privatización. La acción, organizada por el Sindicat de Llogateres, forma parte de una lucha iniciada en 2020 contra cláusulas abusivas, precios inflados y falta de mantenimiento.

Según el estudio, la edad media de emancipación se ha elevado hasta los 30,4 años, muy por encima de la media europea de 26,3, debido al elevado coste de la vivienda. Actualmente, el alquiler de un piso completo supone el 92% del salario de un joven, y apenas el 3,3% de las viviendas son de alquiler social. Como consecuencia, la propiedad entre menores de 35 años ha caído del 58% en 2017 al 27% en 2024, a pesar de que el 80% de estos jóvenes desearía poder adquirir una vivienda propia. Además, el aumento de la vivienda turística y la falta de regulación han reducido aún más la disponibilidad de pisos.

Se explica que la crisis actual difiere de la de 2008 en que no se basa en una burbuja del crédito o la construcción, sino en un fenómeno alimentado por capital extranjero especulativo y la influencia de los trabajadores remotos con altos salarios. Además, se detalla el aumento del esfuerzo económico necesario para adquirir vivienda, el 'muro de entrada' financiero que obliga a muchas familias a permanecer en el alquiler, que es más caro y consume gran parte de sus ingresos, impidiendo el ahorro. El texto también analiza cómo el capital global y los inversores fijan los precios marginalmente, generando una burbuja estable y creciente, y expone el fenómeno de la gentrificación y desplazamiento de la población local en las grandes ciudades.

El vehículo, ahora denominado 'vehículo de la esperanza', cuenta con un área de triaje, espacio de examinación, equipos para estabilización de traumatismos, cuidados de amputaciones y tratamiento pediátrico de emergencia. Además, está equipado con unidades de refrigeración para transporte seguro de vacunas, insulina o antibióticos y un sistema energético que le permite operar hasta ocho horas sin conexión eléctrica.

Beni sostiene que el diario dirigido por Ignacio Escolar habría considerado un 'desprecio a la cabecera' que ella cuestionara la publicación de dicha información, que a su juicio no constituía una noticia relevante y solo buscaba desacreditar al Tribunal Supremo después de una sentencia que no agradó a la línea editorial del medio.

Esta tipología de paneles, producidos por la empresa española Alucoil y comercializados como Larson PE, actúa como una 'gasolina sólida' en contacto con el fuego, acelerando su propagación mediante un efecto chimenea en las fachadas ventiladas. A pesar de advertencias técnicas desde 2008 y varias tragedias, España carece de un censo público de edificios con estas fachadas peligrosas, y aunque se han producido algunas iniciativas políticas para sustituir estos materiales, no se han llevado a cabo acciones contundentes.

La sentencia confirma la denuncia de ELA, que desde abril de 2024 señalaba que la empresa penalizaba a los empleados en situación de incapacidad temporal, afectando negativamente a quienes no pueden trabajar por razones médicas ajenas a su voluntad. La sentencia subraya que la práctica de VW vulnera la Ley 15/2022 de igualdad de trato y no discriminación. Durante el juicio, UGT, CCOO y el presidente del Comité de Empresa apoyaron a la dirección, defendiendo que la exclusión de incentivos no constituía discriminación y que reflejaba un equilibrio interno del convenio.

A través de datos históricos del Banco de España y la Sociedad de Tasación, el texto muestra que mientras en los años ochenta se necesitaban entre tres y cuatro años de salario bruto para comprar una vivienda, hoy hacen falta entre ocho y catorce, dependiendo de la zona. Madrid y Barcelona destacan como epicentros de esta nueva burbuja, impulsada no por el crédito o la construcción como en 2008, sino por la entrada masiva de capital especulativo y extranjero. 

El análisis destaca varios factores: el “muro de entrada” que obliga a disponer de grandes ahorros previos para poder hipotecarse, la inflación de bienes básicos que reduce la capacidad de ahorro, y la paradoja de que alquilar es más caro que pagar una hipoteca, pero resulta inalcanzable acceder a ella.

La reforma, negociada entre la Comisión Europea y el gobierno marroquí, ha generado gran polémica entre los agricultores europeos, que consideran que esto vulnera la regulación europea sobre denominaciones de origen y etiquetado. Según la nueva normativa, frutas y verduras originarias del Sáhara Occidental podrán llevar la denominación de regiones marroquíes como El Aaiún - Saguía - el Hamra y Dajla - Río de Oro, sin mencionar explícitamente su verdadero origen. El Partido Popular Europeo presentó una moción para impedir este cambio, pero no obtuvo los 360 votos necesarios, quedándose en 359.

Su abogado afirmó que se encontraba en proceso de obtener la residencia legal antes de la detención. El caso ha cobrado notoriedad tras difundirse una antigua fotografía familiar en la que aparece Ferreira junto a su hijo, Michael Leavitt Jr., fruto de su relación con Michael Leavitt, hermano de la portavoz. El menor, de 11 años, vive actualmente con su padre y su madrastra, aunque mantenía contacto con su madre biológica hasta que fue arrestada por ICE hace varias semanas.

Según los informes, el joven permaneció más de 40 minutos en el suelo hasta morir, y los paramédicos que intentaron asistirlo fueron bloqueados. Posteriormente, su cuerpo fue confiscado y no devuelto a la familia, lo que ha sido denunciado como una posible violación del derecho internacional humanitario.

El relato abarca su viaje global para estudiar el uso terapéutico de las setas, desde antiguas tradiciones romanas hasta prácticas indígenas del pueblo mazateco. Esta obra combina un enfoque visualmente experimental con rigor científico, reflejando tanto la pasión de los Wasson por las setas como los riesgos psicológicos asociados a su consumo, especialmente en personas susceptibles a trastornos como la esquizofrenia. Blomerth destaca la importancia de la mediación experta en ciertos contextos culturales donde se emplean hongos con fines terapéuticos o rituales.

Su nombramiento, apoyado por el Gobierno y respaldado por operadores jurídicos, refleja continuidad con la línea de sus predecesores socialistas Dolores Delgado y Álvaro García Ortiz, pero también evidencia su perfil ideológico en cuestiones de género.

Manos Limpias, un colectivo de ideología ultraderechista, fue el impulsor de la denuncia inicial basada en recortes de prensa —algunos de ellos posteriormente desmentidos— que sirvieron como base para abrir la causa. 

La decisión judicial se tomó el pasado 24 de noviembre, coincidiendo con la renuncia del abogado del pseudosindicato, Carlos Perales.

Según el Ministerio Fiscal, la forense realizó juicios de valor improcedentes y culpabilizó a las víctimas durante las exploraciones médicas, lo que llevó a algunas de ellas a desistir de sus denuncias. Los hechos investigados se centran en tres episodios ocurridos entre 2019 y 2022 en hospitales sevillanos.

Ordóñez reprocha a Ayuso que intente dividir a las víctimas en bandos y defendió que tanto las víctimas de la memoria histórica como las de ETA merecen igual derecho a la reparación. Además, acusó a Ayuso de insistir en hablar de ETA en 2025, cuando la banda se disolvió hace años. También denunció el uso electoral que el Partido Popular hace de las víctimas de ETA, calificando ese trato como una falta de respeto y un ataque a la dignidad de las víctimas.

Entre 2011 y 2020, Christian Nègre presuntamente ofrecía cafés o tés mezclados con un diurético potente que provocaba una necesidad urgente de orinar. Las víctimas relatan que, durante largas caminatas fuera de los edificios ministeriales, se vieron incapaces de llegar a los baños, sufriendo situaciones humillantes y afectando su vida profesional y personal. La investigación comenzó en 2018 tras la denuncia de un intento de Nègre de fotografiar piernas de una funcionaria, encontrando la policía una hoja de cálculo con registros de los supuestos incidentes. A pesar de estar bajo investigación formal desde 2019, Nègre ha seguido trabajando en el sector privado y las víctimas critican la lentitud del proceso judicial, que prolonga su trauma.

La factura asciende a 165 euros por dos menús concertados y fue pagada por el PP de la Comunitat Valenciana. El reservado es una sala sobria con una mesa ovalada, cinco sillas, dos ventanales y un pequeño mueble auxiliar, con unas dimensiones de 4,43 metros de largo por 2,83 de ancho. La jueza que investiga la gestión de la Dana solicitó estas pruebas para valorar la posibilidad de que Vilaplana pudiera haber escuchado conversaciones o llamadas telefónicas mantenidas por Mazón durante la comida.

Estos mensajes, encontrados en un grupo de WhatsApp llamado 'Naranjito', datan entre 2017 y 2020 y reflejan una comunicación cifrada entre García y sus exvicepresidentes Fernando Giménez y Óscar Liria.

El procedimiento se inició después de que una persona llamara desde Madrid para denunciar la existencia de un vídeo difundido por el propio hostelero en redes sociales, donde se veía una discusión en la terraza del establecimiento. La Policía Nacional remitió el vídeo al juzgado, lo que dio lugar a la apertura de diligencias, pese a no haber denuncia directa de los supuestos perjudicados, dado que los delitos de odio son perseguibles de oficio.

Sin embargo, el juez señala que no se ha podido identificar ni citar a los turistas involucrados debido a la falta de colaboración de la embajada de Israel en España, que no respondió a los requerimientos oficiales.

En una conferencia grabada en vídeo, Del Moral afirmó que el artículo 301 de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal, que obliga a mantener en reserva las diligencias hasta la apertura del juicio oral, no se aplica en la práctica y que quizás es mejor que no se cumpla para no “lastrar la sociedad constitucional”. El magistrado reconoció que resulta “feo oírlo en boca de un juez”, pero insistió en que en la realidad jurídica española este precepto se vulnera de manera constante sin consecuencias.

Este desarrollo no solo destaca por su potencia punta, sino también por su capacidad de operación continua de entre 350 y 400 kW, lo que proporciona una densidad de potencia continua de 27,6 kW/kg, superior a la densidad máxima de la mayoría de motores rivales. Comparado con otros motores de alto rendimiento, como el SPX177 de Helix o los motores de Donut Labs y Equipmake, el nuevo motor de YASA duplica ampliamente la densidad de potencia. La compañía enfatiza que su tecnología es escalable y no depende de materiales exóticos, lo que abre la posibilidad de que se implemente en vehículos más accesibles, además de posibles hypercars de Mercedes-AMG.

La cifra supera en unos 31.000 fallecidos los datos oficiales proporcionados por las autoridades gazatíes, que sitúan el número de víctimas en torno a 69.000. El estudio, en el que también participó el Centro de Estudios Demográficos de Barcelona, se basó en fuentes del Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, la ONG israelí B'Tselem, la ONU y organismos de estadística palestinos. Mediante modelos demográficos que ajustan la falta de información fiable, los investigadores calcularon que entre diciembre de 2024 y octubre de 2025 la mortalidad violenta alcanzó al menos 100.000 personas.

Fundado por Eugene Mulvihill, comenzó en 1976 con un tobogán alpino y se expandió rápidamente, incorporando nuevas atracciones acuáticas y de motor, como el Waterworld y Motorworld. El parque se hizo famoso por sus atracciones peligrosas, entre ellas el Cannonball Loop, un tobogán cerrado con un bucle vertical, y la piscina de olas Tidal Wave, donde ocurrieron múltiples ahogamientos. Otras atracciones como Alpine Slide, Roaring Rapids y Tarzan Swing también estuvieron marcadas por numerosos accidentes y lesiones graves. La combinación de diseño poco seguro, mantenimiento irregular y personal juvenil contribuyó a su reputación de parque «sin ley». Durante su apogeo, recibía más de un millón de visitantes anuales, y se convirtió en un referente cultural de la infancia en el área de Tri-State.

Para evitarlo, Jesús Gil, Enrique Cerezo y Miguel Ángel Gil Marín articularon una operación financiera que permitió que el club fuera controlado mayoritariamente por ellos sin un desembolso real de capital. Esta maniobra incluyó préstamos canalizados a través de bancos, una deuda parcialmente perdonada y el uso de un ingreso temporal de fondos en la cuenta del Atlético que luego fueron devueltos, garantizando así el control del 97% de las acciones por parte de Gil y Cerezo.

Los tres hombres, de origen marroquí, están acusados de violación en grupo y robo. La investigación policial continúa abierta, ya que no se descarta la participación de más personas en el ataque.

Fue trasladado al cuartel de Intxaurrondo, donde sufrió graves torturas que provocaron su muerte. La versión oficial sostuvo que Zabalza murió ahogado tras intentar escapar de un supuesto zulo, pero un informe del Gobierno vasco de 2022 demostró que falleció debido a los malos tratos recibidos en el cuartel. Durante la operación también fueron detenidos y maltratados varios familiares y allegados, incluyendo hermanos, novia y primos. Su cadáver apareció el 15 de diciembre en el río Bidasoa. Años después, tanto el Gobierno vasco como el navarro reconocieron a Zabalza y a su familia como víctimas de violencia policial, lo que conllevó una compensación económica y reparación simbólica.

Según la Red para el Rescate de la Vivienda (REVIVE), desde 2005 el precio de la vivienda ha aumentado nueve veces más rápido que el salario promedio, lo que ha convertido el acceso a una vivienda en un lujo inalcanzable. Entre los factores que agravan la situación están la limitada oferta de nuevas viviendas, los procesos burocráticos que frenan la construcción y los salarios insuficientes. Muchos jóvenes destinan hasta el 40% de sus ingresos al alquiler, lo que hace casi imposible ahorrar para un enganche o acceder a un crédito hipotecario.

Sandra, aunque en shock, continuó con la actuación y días después decidieron comunicar públicamente lo ocurrido para proteger el entorno seguro de sus conciertos. La banda pide a los asistentes que informen de cualquier situación de violencia o incomodidad al equipo de seguridad para garantizar la protección de todos.

Esta acción simbólica tuvo lugar en Johannesburgo, pocos días antes de la cumbre del G20, y buscaba visibilizar la alarmante cifra de 15 mujeres asesinadas cada día por violencia machista, una de las tasas más altas del mundo. La protesta ha logrado que el gobierno declare la violencia de género como desastre nacional, lo que obliga a destinar más recursos y medidas específicas para su prevención. A pesar de los marcos legales existentes, las tasas de feminicidio permanecen elevadas, según la ONU y el Instituto de Criminología de la Universidad de Ciudad del Cabo. Expertas subrayan que la falta de implementación efectiva de las leyes y la impunidad institucional son factores clave.

El actor, de 70 años, canceló su participación en el programa 'Top Chef: Dulces y famosos', un proyecto culinario en el que iba a participar como uno de los fichajes estrella. Este ingreso ha generado gran preocupación tanto en su círculo personal como profesional. Resines, que ya había tenido ausencias previas debido a cuestiones de salud, fue hospitalizado después de un susto que lo obligó a suspender sus actividades. El director de la revista Semana, Jorge Borrajo, tranquilizó a los fans al confirmar que el actor se encuentra fuera de peligro.

Aunque Microsoft recomendó actualizar a Windows 11, muchos se han mostrado reacios debido a sus mayores requisitos, problemas iniciales de rendimiento y bugs persistentes. Esto ha generado una migración significativa hacia Linux, destacando especialmente la distribución Zorin OS. En solo cinco semanas desde el fin de Windows 10, Zorin OS 18 ha superado el millón de descargas, de las cuales un 78% provienen de usuarios de Windows, lo que supone aproximadamente 780.000 personas que han decidido abandonar el sistema operativo de Microsoft. Zorin OS se caracteriza por su interfaz intuitiva, inspirada en Windows y MacOS, facilitando la transición a usuarios no familiarizados con Linux.

El hermanastro menor, de 15 años, fue detenido pero posteriormente liberado sin medidas cautelares, ya que no participó directamente en la agresión. La investigación, que se enfrentó a la dificultad de la ausencia de testigos, se apoyó principalmente en las grabaciones de cámaras de seguridad que permitieron identificar a los agresores.

Durante las dos últimas décadas, la UE experimentó una fuerte integración global, pero hoy esa apertura ha generado vulnerabilidades. Las exportaciones, que antes eran un motor de crecimiento, han dejado de ser una fuente fiable debido a factores como la guerra en Ucrania, los aranceles estadounidenses y la creciente competencia de China.

Sin embargo, si los utilizamos para almacenamiento a largo plazo sin alimentación, pueden perder datos con el tiempo. La memoria NAND de los SSDs almacena información mediante cargas eléctricas, pero esta retención no es indefinida. Por ejemplo, los SSDs con QLC pueden conservar datos aproximadamente un año sin energía, los de TLC hasta 3 años, mientras que los MLC y SLC pueden llegar a 5 y 10 años respectivamente. La mayoría de los consumidores usan SSDs de QLC o TLC, por lo que dejar un disco sin uso más de un año implica un riesgo de pérdida de datos. Otros factores como la temperatura y la calidad de la memoria también aceleran esta degradación. Para la mayoría de los usuarios que usan SSDs como almacenamiento primario, esto no supone un problema, ya que los reemplazan antes de agotar su vida útil.

A través de testimonios de protagonistas como Javier, Pepe, Mamen y Latyr, la película visibiliza las duras experiencias del sinhogarismo. Gere destaca que cualquiera puede acabar en esa situación por problemas de salud, financieros o laborales, subrayando que no hay diferencias esenciales entre una persona famosa y un sintecho. Mamen relata cómo vivió en la calle más de dos décadas enfrentándose a violencia y abandono. El documental busca romper la invisibilidad social y concienciar para promover soluciones como el acceso a vivienda digna, apoyado por Hogar Sí, que atiende a más de 10.000 personas y señala que hay más de 37.000 sin hogar en España.

Aunque reconocen que sus condiciones laborales son mejores que en otros comercios, las trabajadoras destacan que los ingresos no permiten afrontar gastos básicos, incluyendo la vivienda y la cesta de la compra, que es significativamente más cara en las islas. Algunos casos extremos han llevado a empleadas de Zara a recurrir a entidades como Cáritas. Los sindicatos UGT y CCOO han organizado concentraciones en ciudades europeas durante el Black Friday para exigir un reparto más equitativo de la riqueza generada por Inditex, aunque estas acciones no se realizan en Canarias.

A pesar de que el líder de las FAR, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, conocido como Hemedti, anunció una tregua humanitaria unilateral de tres meses en respuesta a un plan de paz promovido por Estados Unidos y respaldado por el Cuarteto para Sudán (EE.UU., Egipto, Arabia Saudí y Emiratos Árabes Unidos), el Ejército sudanés la rechazó considerándola inaceptable. Hemedti se comprometió a proteger los convoyes de ayuda, facilitar el acceso de personal humanitario y cooperar con organismos internacionales como la ONU, mientras pedía presión sobre la otra parte para que aceptara la tregua. La guerra, iniciada el 15 de abril de 2023 tras un enfrentamiento entre los dos líderes por la integración de las FAR en el Ejército, ha provocado decenas de miles de muertos y más de 13 millones de desplazados.

El acceso a la vivienda es cada vez más difícil debido a los precios historicamente altos, con un aumento del 13,8% en venta y del 40% en alquiler en comparación con 2007. Sin embargo, el estudio advierte que construir más viviendas no necesariamente reduce los precios, a menos que se enfoquen en viviendas asequibles y sociales, que actualmente representan menos del 10% de las transacciones y se han reducido al 7,8% en 2024.

Almeida acusó a Maroto de estar rodeada de 'corrupción esférica' y de haber mentido en una comisión de investigación, además de vincularla con casos relacionados con Víctor Aldama y supuestos viajes con empresarios como Globalia y personas próximas al PSOE. Maroto, visiblemente molesta, pidió al alcalde que dejara de usar el 'comodín de Bildu' y le instó a acudir a los tribunales si tenía pruebas de irregularidades.

En 1995, propuso a los medios publicar su manifiesto, 'La sociedad industrial y su futuro', prometiendo abandonar sus actos. Este texto, junto a otros ensayos, se publican por primera vez en España en la obra 'Desde un bosque lejano' (Errata naturae, 2025). Kaczynski critica la Revolución Industrial, considerándola un desastre que aumentó la esperanza de vida pero provocó daños sociales, psicológicos y ecológicos. Denuncia una humanidad 'hipersocializada' y atrapada en 'actividades sustitutas' insatisfactorias, además de prever peligros como la ingeniería genética, la crisis ecológica y la ascensión de la inteligencia artificial. Propone una revolución radical para eliminar el sistema tecnológico y regresar a una vida en armonía con la naturaleza. Su ideología incluye una crítica al izquierdismo y defiende el uso de la viole]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/publican-por-primera-vez-en-espana-los-ensayos-de-theodore-kaczynski-el-unabomber-y-su-critica-a-la-sociedad-tecnologica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/publican-por-primera-vez-en-espana-los-ensayos-de-theodore-kaczynski-el-unabomber-y-su-critica-a-la-sociedad-tecnologica</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aficionados preparan una denuncia contra LaLiga por el envío de cartas de reclamación y amenazas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La tensión entre LaLiga y parte de la afición española ha aumentado tras el envío de cartas a particulares acusados de ver partidos por vías no oficiales. Estas comunicaciones, firmadas en nombre de LaLiga, exigen el pago de 450,16 euros por “daños y perjuicios” y advierten de posibles acciones legales si no se cumple el requerimiento. Muchos receptores aseguran no entender el motivo de la acusación ni cómo la entidad ha obtenido sus datos personales. El abogado Miguel Galán ha iniciado una recogida de cartas con la intención de presentar una denuncia ante el Tribunal Administrativo del Deporte contra Javier Tebas, presidente de LaLiga, y la organización. La acción pretende determinar la legalidad de esta práctica y si respeta la normativa de protección de datos. El caso también ha generado preocupación por la posible vulneración del derecho a la privacidad, ya que implica identificar a personas a partir de su conexión a internet y asociarlas con consumos ilícitos.

La pareja, de 18 y 24 años, se encontraba en su coche cuando un grupo de tres hombres de origen marroquí rompió las ventanas del vehículo. Los agresores sacaron a la chica del coche y la violaron en presencia de su novio, mientras retenían a este último para que presenciara la agresión. Tras la denuncia inmediata de la pareja, la policía arrestó a tres sospechosos, dos de ellos pocas horas después del ataque y el tercero días después en Venecia. Se sospecha que el grupo podría estar formado por cinco personas, por lo que continúan las investigaciones para capturar a los dos restantes. La evidencia que vincula a los arrestados incluye las huellas digitales en los cristales rotos del coche y el testimonio detallado de las víctimas. La policía sigue activa en la búsqueda de los otros implicados, mientras la investigación permanece abierta.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detienen-a-tres-hombres-por-violacion-en-grupo-a-una-joven-en-el-parque-tor-tre-teste-de-roma-investigan-a-otros-dos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detienen-a-tres-hombres-por-violacion-en-grupo-a-una-joven-en-el-parque-tor-tre-teste-de-roma-investigan-a-otros-dos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China envía la Shenzhou 22 para sustituir una cápsula dañada en la estación espacial]]></title><description><![CDATA[La misión Shenzhou 22 ha llegado a la estación espacial china (CSS) pocas horas después de su lanzamiento, en una operación catalogada oficialmente como una misión de respuesta a emergencias. Su objetivo principal es proporcionar una cápsula plenamente operativa a la tripulación de la Shenzhou 21, que permanecía en la estación con una nave cuyo estado no ofrecía garantías suficientes para un eventual regreso. Todo comenzó cuando la tripulación de la Shenzhou 20 descubrió que su cápsula había sufrido un impacto de basura espacial en una de las ventanillas, un daño que comprometía la seguridad del vehículo. Aunque todavía era teóricamente utilizable, el programa espacial chino decidió no arriesgar y organizar un regreso alternativo. Por ello, la tripulación de la Shenzhou 20 volvió a la Tierra a bordo de la Shenzhou 21, dejando a los recién llegados sin cápsula plenamente fiable para emergencias. Para resolver esta situación, la CMSA aceleró el despliegue de la Shenzhou 22, que viajó sin]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-envia-la-shenzhou-22-para-sustituir-una-capsula-danada-en-la-estacion-espacial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-envia-la-shenzhou-22-para-sustituir-una-capsula-danada-en-la-estacion-espacial</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 19:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ucrania aprueba provisionalmente el plan de paz estadounidense mientras se afinan detalles]]></title><description><![CDATA[Según informaciones de ABC News, Ucrania habría dado su aprobación inicial a un plan de paz impulsado por Estados Unidos con el objetivo de poner fin al conflicto con Rusia, aunque todavía se estarían ajustando 'detalles menores' antes de su presentación formal. Un funcionario estadounidense citado de forma anónima confirmó que Ucrania ha aceptado el acuerdo, quedando pendientes únicamente ajustes técnicos. Las negociaciones han tenido lugar de manera discreta en Ginebra y Abu Dabi, incluyendo encuentros entre representantes estadounidenses y rusos, en lo que parece ser el intento más serio de la administración de Donald Trump para resolver la guerra. El documento original, compuesto por 28 puntos, habría sido reducido a unos 20 y moderado en aspectos controvertidos, aunque no se ha aclarado si estas modificaciones cumplen las exigencias mínimas de seguridad de Kiev ni cómo afectan al control territorial, fuerzas militares ucranianas o levantamiento de sanciones a Rusia.

Varios padres denunciaron que sus hijas, alumnas de Educación Infantil, habrían sido víctimas de tocamientos y comportamientos inapropiados por parte del docente, que llevaba más de veinte años en el centro. El caso salió a la luz a finales de octubre, cuando una menor relató a su familia hechos que levantaron sospechas. Los progenitores acudieron de inmediato al cuartel de la Guardia Civil, que inició diligencias bajo la instrucción del Juzgado de Instrucción número 3 de Málaga. Según la Delegación Territorial de Educación, la dirección del colegio fue informada durante una reunión con las familias y comunicó los hechos a la Inspección educativa. Aunque se dictaron medidas para proteger a los menores, no llegaron a aplicarse porque los agentes actuaron inmediatamente.

Este dispositivo luminoso permite señalizar un vehículo averiado sin salir de él, evitando así el riesgo de atropellos que suponía el uso del triángulo de emergencia. La idea surgió en 1999, cuando Torre, testigo de numerosos accidentes, decidió crear una luz de emergencia potente para colocar en los techos de los coches. Tras años de trabajo y varios fracasos empresariales, ambos fundaron su empresa en 2016, fabricando las primeras unidades con escasos recursos y la ayuda de los primeros inversores y víctimas de accidentes que creyeron en su proyecto. La baliza V-16 evolucionó hasta convertirse en un dispositivo inteligente capaz de conectarse a la nube y avisar de incidentes automáticamente. Fabricada en Zaragoza, la planta de Netun/Help Flash combina tecnología avanzada y empleo inclusivo, con un 30% de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dos-guardias-civiles-gallegos-desarrollan-la-baliza-v-16-obligatoria-para-30-millones-de-vehiculos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dos-guardias-civiles-gallegos-desarrollan-la-baliza-v-16-obligatoria-para-30-millones-de-vehiculos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 17:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Javier Aureliano investigado por presunta corrupción y blanqueo de fondos en la Diputación de Almería]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 18 de noviembre de 2025, la Guardia Civil registró el domicilio del presidente de la Diputación de Almería, Javier Aureliano García, y de su mano derecha, Fernando Giménez, en el marco de una investigación por presunta corrupción y blanqueo de capitales. Según el auto judicial de 66 páginas, el expresidente no solo conocía, sino que supuestamente avalaba mediante códigos encriptados las comisiones ilegales generadas a partir de contratos públicos sobrevalorados, especialmente durante la pandemia. La adjudicación del contrato de material sanitario a la empresa Azor Corporate Ibérica, S.L. con un sobrecoste de 945.327,61 euros, se considera el punto de partida de la investigación. La familia del presidente habría actuado como intermediaria para blanquear el dinero en efectivo a través de cuentas y propiedades.

Los nuevos chips de CXMT están destinados a ordenadores de sobremesa, portátiles, servidores y dispositivos móviles como smartphones y tablets, lo que representa una importante apuesta por la soberanía tecnológica china. La producción incluye chips de 16 y 24 Gb para módulos de memoria utilizados en centros de datos y ordenadores gaming, así como chips de 12 y 16 Gb para dispositivos móviles de alto rendimiento.

Tras constatar que la empresa del aparcamiento había eliminado los registros de entradas y salidas por haber transcurrido más de un año, la magistrada optó por rastrear el pago del ticket. Para ello requirió a la periodista sus datos bancarios con el fin de identificar el cargo correspondiente entre el listado de pagos facilitado por la empresa. El análisis determinó que el único cobro de 15,10 euros asociado a su tarjeta corresponde a una salida del aparcamiento a las 19:47 horas.

Esto implica, según el testimonio del propietario de El Ventorro, que Vilaplana abandonó el aparcamiento casi una hora después de haber salido del restaurante junto al president Carlos Mazón, quien según ese testimonio se marchó entre las 18:30 y las 19:00. La periodista, por su parte, había]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-jueza-de-la-dana-verifica-el-horario-de-salida-del-aparcamiento-de-maribel-vilaplana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-jueza-de-la-dana-verifica-el-horario-de-salida-del-aparcamiento-de-maribel-vilaplana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
