Soltani, a resident of Fardis near Tehran, was arrested on January 8, 2026, for participating in demonstrations calling for the removal of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. According to human rights organizations, he was tried without legal representation and denied access to counsel, raising serious concerns about due process. The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights reported that Soltani’s family was only informed of his death sentence two days before the scheduled execution and granted a brief 10-minute visit. His sister, a lawyer, was barred from defending him or accessing his case documents. International observers fear the move signals a harsher wave of repression, as Iran’s leadership seems determined to quell growing dissent.

According to bystander video, a passenger exited the car moments before it continued along the tracks near another train, avoiding a potentially serious accident. The passenger appeared uninjured. Andrew Maynard, a professor specializing in emerging technologies at Arizona State University, described the incident as a rare 'edge case'—an unusual situation where the vehicle’s artificial intelligence made a non-human-like decision. He explained that despite frequent software updates and the 29 cameras used in Waymo's cars, unforeseen conditions, such as recent construction and new rail lines in the area, can confuse navigation systems. Maynard stressed that such events, while alarming, are part of the learning curve for autonomous vehicle technology. He added that overall, self-driving cars tend to be safer than human drivers]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/waymo-self-driving-car-mistakenly-stops-on-rail-tracks-amid-construction-changes-in-phoenix</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/waymo-self-driving-car-mistakenly-stops-on-rail-tracks-amid-construction-changes-in-phoenix</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 02:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Tribute to Historian Eva Tobalina and the Value of Knowledge]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article published on the blog *La mirada del mendigo* pays tribute to Eva Tobalina, a professor of Ancient History known for her engaging and scholarly lectures. It explains how the cultural association Raíces de Europa, based in Álava, first invited her to give a talk on Alexander the Great. The conference was so well received that Tobalina was repeatedly invited back, eventually recording nearly 250 lectures that have collectively garnered hundreds of thousands of views online. The author views this as impressive proof that there remains a significant audience seeking cultural and intellectual enrichment rather than superficial entertainment.

The piece praises Tobalina’s mastery of her subject, her command of language, and her oratorical ability—all essential to transforming academic material into captivating storytelling. Beyond Tobalina’s success, the author uses the occasion to make a broader social commentary: a nation’s future depends on how it values knowledge and respect ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-tribute-to-historian-eva-tobalina-and-the-value-of-knowledge</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-tribute-to-historian-eva-tobalina-and-the-value-of-knowledge</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Argentina Launches Isaac Accords to Strengthen Israel-Latin America Ties]]></title><description><![CDATA[Argentine President Javier Milei has announced the launch of the Isaac Accords, a new diplomatic framework modeled after the Abraham Accords, aimed at deepening ties between Israel and Latin American countries. The initiative seeks to foster cooperation in areas such as innovation, security, commerce, cultural exchange, technology, and economic development. During a meeting in Buenos Aires with Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar, Milei positioned Argentina as a pioneer alongside the United States in promoting this regional pact. Initial focus will be on countries like Uruguay, Panama, and Costa Rica, where joint projects are already under discussion. The accords also encourage partner nations to relocate their embassies to Jerusalem, designate groups like Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, and adjust anti-Israel stances at the United Nations. This move aligns with Milei's pro-Israel policies, including Argentina's designation of Hamas as a terrorist group and plans to s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/argentina-launches-isaac-accords-to-strengthen-israel-latin-america-ties</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/argentina-launches-isaac-accords-to-strengthen-israel-latin-america-ties</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Supporters Float Absurd Marriage Proposal Linking Barron Trump and Danish Princess Isabella to U.S. Claims on Greenland]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent online trend among Donald Trump supporters has sparked controversy after some proposed that Barron Trump, the former president's 19-year-old son, should marry Denmark’s 18-year-old Princess Isabella as part of a 'diplomatic solution' to allow the United States to claim Greenland as a dowry. These discussions, circulating on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), featured users sharing AI-generated images of the pair in wedding scenes, describing the imagined union as 'a clever deal' and 'a match made in heaven.' However, the idea was quickly met with widespread backlash. Critics condemned it as 'medieval fan fiction' and mocked the notion that nations could be exchanged through marriage in modern geopolitics.

The controversy ties back to Donald Trump’s renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, a resource-rich territory with strategic importance. Trump previously called for the U.S. to acquire it, arguing that Denmark could not manage Greenland’s security and economi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-supporters-float-absurd-marriage-proposal-linking-barron-trump-and-danish-princess-isabella-to-u-s-claims-on-greenland</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-supporters-float-absurd-marriage-proposal-linking-barron-trump-and-danish-princess-isabella-to-u-s-claims-on-greenland</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Niger government revokes authorization of hundreds of NGOs over financial transparency violations]]></title><description><![CDATA[The government of Niger has formally dissolved a large number of non-governmental organizations and development associations following what it describes as repeated failures to comply with financial transparency regulations. According to a decree signed by the Ministry of the Interior, only 1,809 organizations are now authorized to continue operating in the country, including 1,684 local NGOs and 125 international entities. All other registered organizations have been removed from the official registry.

Authorities argue that the affected NGOs failed to submit mandatory accounting documents within the legally established deadlines, despite receiving several formal warnings. The government maintains that these organizations deliberately ignored official orders. This mass dissolution represents the final stage of a process that began roughly two months earlier, when the government suspended all NGOs that had not published their 2024 financial statements in the Official State Bulletin.

It reports public outrage at President Javier Milei’s government for severe budget cuts that allegedly crippled Argentina’s firefighting capacity. The author connects the fires to theories claiming foreign—particularly Israeli—actors are igniting blazes to enable land acquisitions and resource control. The piece revisits past incidents involving Israeli backpackers accused of causing fires in Chile’s Torres del Paine National Park and suggests parallels with today’s events. It criticizes Milei’s austerity measures, including drastic reductions in funding for environmental and fire management agencies. The article further alleges that Israeli-linked corporations, such as Mekorot, and businessmen like Eduardo Elsztain and Joe Lewis, are consolidating control over Argentina’s natural resources—especially water and land in Patagonia.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/wildfires-in-patagonia-spark-controversy-over-milei-s-environmental-cuts-and-foreign-influence-claims</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/wildfires-in-patagonia-spark-controversy-over-milei-s-environmental-cuts-and-foreign-influence-claims</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 20:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Federal deployment in Minneapolis escalates after ICE killing of Renee Good triggers nationwide protests]]></title><description><![CDATA[The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has sent hundreds of additional federal agents to Minneapolis following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen and mother of three, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. The incident, captured on multiple videos, has sparked massive protests across the country demanding accountability and condemning excessive force by immigration officers. In Minneapolis, demonstrators clashed with heavily armed DHS agents as large-scale door-to-door raids began. Chemical spray was reportedly used, and several arrests were made. Mayor Jacob Frey criticized the federal government for excluding state investigators from the FBI probe and accused officials of spreading false narratives, including unfounded claims that Good was a domestic terrorist. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that even more federal officers would arrive to ensure what she called ‘safe operations.’ Protests extended na]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-deployment-in-minneapolis-escalates-after-ice-killing-of-renee-good-triggers-nationwide-protests</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-deployment-in-minneapolis-escalates-after-ice-killing-of-renee-good-triggers-nationwide-protests</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 15:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump reportedly considered military plans for Greenland, meeting resistance from top generals]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to a report originally published by the Daily Mail and cited by Firstpost, former U.S. President Donald Trump allegedly directed senior special forces commanders to draw up contingency plans for a potential invasion of Greenland. The initiative reportedly faced strong opposition from high-ranking U.S. military officers, who warned that such an operation would be both illegal and politically disastrous without congressional authorization. The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) was said to have been tasked with drafting the plan, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff resisted, expressing concerns about international law and domestic repercussions.

Diplomatic sources quoted in the report described internal frustration among senior generals, with some claiming they tried to redirect Trump’s attention to other military priorities such as countering Russian ‘ghost ships’ or targeting Iranian assets. The push for a Greenland operation was reportedly influenced by hardline advisors in ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reportedly-considered-military-plans-for-greenland-meeting-resistance-from-top-generals</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reportedly-considered-military-plans-for-greenland-meeting-resistance-from-top-generals</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minneapolis Pastor Says ICE Released Him After Racially Charged Comment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pastor Kenny Callaghan of Minneapolis recounted a disturbing interaction with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during protests following the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent. According to Callaghan, agents shoved and handcuffed him before placing him in the back of an SUV. He said that after being detained, the officers mocked him, asking if he was afraid, to which he responded defiantly. Eventually, they released him, allegedly saying that because he was white, detaining him 'wouldn’t be any fun.' The event occurred near protests against the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman shot by an ICE officer. Federal officials have not confirmed Callaghan’s account. The report situates the incident within a larger political context under the Trump administration, noting concerns about racial bias, extremist rhetoric, and the acceleration of aggressive immigration enforcement.

Among those detained were children as young as 10 years old and some who were already injured at the time of arrest, with many held in administrative detention without formal charges. The report states that around 350 children are still in Israeli prisons, where they are said to be deprived of education and subjected to long sentences and harsh conditions, including torture, starvation, lack of medical care, and restrictions on family visits.

The article then shifts to developments in France, highlighting a draft law proposed by French MP Caroline Yadan that would criminalize speaking negatively about the State of Israel if approved by the National Assembly, with debate scheduled for 20 January.

In an alleged CNN interview, Miller supposedly claimed that the United States, as a superpower, has the right to act to secure its strategic interests and prevent neighboring countries from supplying resources to its adversaries. He is also quoted asserting that 'sovereign countries have no sovereignty if the U.S. wants their resources,' a statement described by Congressman Seth Moulton as 'delusional' and 'deeply disturbing.' Miller’s comments reportedly followed similarly aggressive declarations by U.S. ambassador Michael Waltz at a United Nations Security Council emergency meeting, warning that Washington would not allow key global energy reserves to remain under the control of America's rivals.

The French meteorological service reported that this is one of the most intense cold spells in at least eight years, with temperatures dropping 12–15°C below seasonal averages across Central, Western, and Southwestern Europe. France saw mass flight cancellations, with around 40% of flights scrapped at Charles de Gaulle Airport and 25% at Orly. Many regions restricted heavy truck circulation, and Nantes Airport halted operations completely. In the Netherlands, about 2,000 flights were canceled at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, forcing over a thousand passengers to spend the night in terminals. Railway and port operations were also heavily affected, and parts of Rotterdam Port stopped container handling due to snow.

The initiative, promoted by President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, aims to replace the current network of local and private jails with a centralized system of large-scale industrial-style facilities. Internal documents and public tenders describe seven regional complexes, each capable of housing between 5,000 and 10,000 detainees, and sixteen smaller sites for up to 1,500 people each—mirroring an 'Amazon-style' logistics model applied to immigration enforcement. 

However, the plan has triggered strong local opposition, particularly in Republican strongholds such as Social Circle, Georgia, where residents expressed outrage at hosting a 9,000-person facility in a town of only 5,000 inhabitants.

The project aims to deliver cutting-edge astronomical research comparable to NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, focusing on deep-space imaging, the study of exoplanets, dark energy, and dark matter. Lazuli will carry three main instruments: the Widefield Context Camera (WCC), the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), and the ExtraSolar Coronograph (ESC), capable of capturing visible and near-infrared light between 350 and 1700 nanometers.

Demonstrations erupted in late December 2025 amid worsening economic conditions and have spread to over 180 cities in all 31 provinces. Eyewitnesses and doctors described hospitals overflowing with wounded protesters and victims shot at close range, including children and bystanders. In Tehran, social media videos show large crowds chanting anti-government slogans such as 'Death to the Dictator' and 'Long live the Shah,' while some buildings, banks, and mosques were set on fire.

Venezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves, exceeding 300 billion barrels, representing about 17% of global reserves, and ranks eighth globally in natural gas reserves, exceeding 200 trillion cubic meters—six times greater than U.S. reserves. The country is also rich in critical minerals such as gold, diamonds, nickel, and coltan, drawing increasing attention from major powers. The emergence of lithium as an essential element for electric vehicles and energy storage has heightened the geopolitical significance of Venezuela, which is believed to have strong lithium potential due to its proximity to South America’s “lithium triangle” (Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina), which contains most of the world’s reserves.

He criticized wind energy, saying that windmills are inefficient, harm landscapes, and kill birds. While Trump accurately described China as a leader in wind turbine manufacturing, he falsely asserted that China itself does not operate any wind farms.

In reality, data shows China is the world’s foremost user of wind power, holding nearly half of global installed capacity. By early 2025, the country operated around 444,000 megawatts of wind energy, representing about 44% of worldwide capacity—nearly triple that of the United States. This figure continued to grow through 2024, even as other nations slowed the development of large-scale renewable projects.

These minors operate from illegal settlement outposts, entering Palestinian villages on foot or by vehicle to vandalize property, destroy water infrastructure, and threaten residents. Their repeated incursions, both day and night, aim to exhaust Palestinian families into leaving their homes. Haaretz reports that this activity forms part of a strategic campaign to displace Palestinians while expanding settler control over land traditionally used for grazing and agriculture. The attacks often follow a coordinated pattern in which minors engage in harassment and destruction over time, paving the way for armed adult settlers to escalate the violence.

The operation has caused alarm in the Indigenous community, where residents accuse ICE agents of racial profiling and targeting Native people who are U.S. citizens. The raids took place primarily in the south side of Minneapolis, a historically Native American neighborhood centered around the Little Earth housing community, the first urban Native housing project in the United States. 

One Indigenous woman, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by ICE agents on Wednesday, sparking nationwide protests.

Initially assumed to have scandalous implications, the artifact, dubbed the 'Glass Phallus of Herford,' is now thought to have served a symbolic or ceremonial function rather than an erotic one. Researchers suggest it could have been a novelty drinking vessel used in elite social gatherings, where humor, satire, and irony played significant roles in Renaissance culture. The find highlights how daily life in early modern convents — often home to noble women — included education, music, and festivities, challenging modern assumptions about strict religious austerity.

The object is displayed in the LWL Museum of Archaeology and Culture in Herne, continuing to intrigue historians and visitors. It also appears in Guido Kleinhubbert’s book Düstere Geheimnisse ('Dark Secrets'), which examines mysterious artifact]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discovery-of-a-17th-century-glass-artifact-in-a-former-german-convent</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discovery-of-a-17th-century-glass-artifact-in-a-former-german-convent</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 23:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former CIA Double Agent Aldrich Ames Dies in U.S. Prison at 84]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aldrich Ames, a former CIA counterintelligence officer who was one of the most damaging moles in U.S. intelligence history, has died in an American prison at the age of 84. During his three-decade career with the CIA, Ames was responsible for identifying foreign infiltration attempts and protecting American sources abroad. However, in the mid-1980s, he began selling highly classified information to the Soviet Union (and later to Russia) in exchange for more than $2.5 million. His betrayal exposed numerous covert operations, led to the arrest of several U.S. agents, and significantly compromised American intelligence capabilities at the end of the Cold War.

Ames and his wife lived far beyond their means, buying luxury cars and maintaining international bank accounts, which eventually drew the attention of investigators. Arrested in 1994, Ames confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, while his wife served several years in prison.

The controversy escalated after Trump, now 79 and in his second term, boasted on Truth Social about scoring '100%' on a third cognitive exam. Medical analyst Dr. Vin Gupta criticized the president’s repeated tests, stating that the frequency of such assessments could indicate ongoing monitoring of cognitive decline rather than routine evaluation. He noted that it is rare for a healthy individual to take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) multiple times unless early-stage dementia is suspected.

Psychologist Dr. John Gartner echoed these concerns, emphasizing that repeating the same cognitive test is generally done to track the progression of dementia, not to confirm normal function. He also suggested that Trump’s increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior could reflect signs of cognitive deterioration.

The Crew Dragon Endeavour will depart from the International Space Station (ISS) carrying Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui, and Oleg Platonov, leaving the Soyuz MS-28 crew—Sergei Kud-Sverchkov, Sergei Mikayev, and Christopher Williams—in orbit. This is the first time in ISS history that a spacecraft returns prematurely for medical reasons, though similar events have occurred earlier in spaceflight history. In 1976, during the Soyuz 21 mission, cosmonaut Vitali Zholobov’s deteriorating psychological state forced an early end to the mission aboard the Salyut 5 station. Later, in 1985, commander Vladimir Vasyutin of Soyuz T-14 suffered a prostate-related infection that led to an unscheduled return from Salyut 7.

Initially introduced as a tool for managing labor and immigration controls, the program could expand to encompass all citizens from birth. According to the report, each baby would receive a digital identification linked to their medical record, enabling unified access to state services such as child benefits, healthcare, and education applications. Supporters argue that it would modernize bureaucracy, while critics see it as a step toward pervasive state surveillance. Human rights organizations, including Big Brother Watch, have voiced strong concerns, calling the plan a serious threat to civil liberties. The initiative, attributed to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, is said to follow models like Estonia’s, where each citizen receives a digital ID at birth for streamlined public service access.

Although the Rule of St Benedict placed little priority on material comfort, cold climates forced monks to develop ways to cope in winter. Monks lived by strict principles of poverty, humility, and communal discipline, and personal ownership was forbidden. Comfort was considered spiritually dangerous, so enduring cold often symbolized devotion and endurance. Still, some practical concessions existed—such as heavier wool cowls in winter and the construction of special heated rooms when possible. The only room in most monasteries with a fire was the calefactorium, or warming room, where monks could briefly gather for warmth. These rooms were rare and valued, as dormitories, churches, and refectories remained unheated. Records from monasteries like Meaux and Rievaulx Abbey in Yorkshire describe how abbots prioritized building th]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/daily-life-and-warmth-in-medieval-monasteries</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/daily-life-and-warmth-in-medieval-monasteries</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Federal Authorities Block Minnesota from Probing ICE Agent’s Fatal Shooting in Minneapolis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Federal authorities have taken exclusive control of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in Minneapolis. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office decided that federal agencies would handle the case without involving Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) or state prosecutors. This decision prevents state officials from accessing key evidence, including reports, witness statements, and physical materials from the scene, effectively blocking Minnesota from conducting an independent investigation.

Minnesota’s Department of Public Safety Commissioner Ben Jacobson and Governor Tim Walz both condemned the move, arguing it undermines transparency and accountability. Walz publicly stated that he does not trust the federal government to investigate fairly, especially under the Trump administration, and called for federal agents to leave Minnesota.

Diagnosed with acute kidney disease in 2022, she relies on Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance to afford her treatments. Without the subsidies, her monthly premium will more than double, putting her medical care beyond reach. Her story mirrors that of more than 22 million Americans, particularly in Republican-led states like Florida, Texas, and Mississippi, who depend on the same financial assistance to maintain coverage.

Congress remains gridlocked over whether to extend the ACA subsidies.

The footage, obtained by Alpha News, shows Ross approaching Good’s maroon Honda Pilot during what authorities described as a federal operation in south Minneapolis. Good, who was a poet, mother of three, and U.S. citizen, seems calm in the video, speaking politely as Ross films around her car. At one point, other agents rush toward the vehicle, shouting for her to get out. Good then reverses and steers away from the agents. Ross, appearing to be almost clear of the SUV’s route, fires three shots while muttering an expletive.

In the interview, he described how gang representatives began communicating with Bukele’s close allies around 2014, when he planned his political rise from mayor of San Salvador to the presidency. Charli asserts that Bukele’s intermediaries, like Carlos Marroquín ('Slip'), offered community benefits and advance warnings about police operations in exchange for electoral support.

Compared with no treatment, regular exercise showed noticeable improvements in mood and mental health. When compared with psychological therapies, the effect of exercise was similar, supported by moderate-quality evidence.

Corbyn draws parallels between Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s response to the Venezuelan crisis and Tony Blair’s support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He argues that both instances demonstrate the UK’s unwillingness to uphold international law when it conflicts with US interests. The article accuses Starmer, a former lawyer, of choosing political convenience over legal and moral principles by avoiding criticism of Donald Trump’s actions. According to Corbyn, the UK’s silence over an illegal bombing and the abduction of a sitting president shows that Britain remains dependent on Washington and has forsaken its duty to defend sovereignty and justice.

The meeting, intended to secure $100 billion in investments for Venezuela’s energy reconstruction, gathered executives from Chevron, Exxon, Halliburton, Valero, and Marathon at the White House. While promising profitability from the proposed deal, Trump received a note from Rubio and, apparently unaware it was private, read it to the entire room, instructing an executive from Chevron to speak. The moment caused visible discomfort among attendees and drew renewed attention to Trump’s increasingly erratic behavior and signs of cognitive decline.

En un mensaje publicado en su red social Truth Social, Trump afirmó que, en caso de que el tribunal declare ilegales los aranceles, el Gobierno se vería obligado a devolver cientos de miles de millones de dólares en concepto de reembolsos. Además, alertó sobre las posibles reclamaciones de compensación de empresas y países que realizaron fuertes inversiones para evitar esos gravámenes, lo que podría elevar la cifra total hasta billones de dólares y provocar un ‘caos total’ en la economía nacional. 

El caso, debatido en noviembre, se centra en el uso que hizo Trump de la Ley de Poderes Económicos de Emergencia Internacional (IEEPA) para justificar la imposición de aranceles a casi todos los socios comerciales de Estados Unidos, incluidos México, Canadá y China, alegando m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-de-graves-consecuencias-economicas-si-la-corte-suprema-anula-sus-aranceles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-de-graves-consecuencias-economicas-si-la-corte-suprema-anula-sus-aranceles</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 08:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rufián critica la propuesta de Sánchez sobre vivienda y advierte del desgaste de la izquierda]]></title><description><![CDATA[El portavoz de Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) en el Congreso, Gabriel Rufián, ha advertido de un posible hundimiento político de la izquierda española que podría prolongarse durante años, tras la polémica propuesta del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, sobre el mercado del alquiler. El plan del Ejecutivo incluye importantes incentivos fiscales a los arrendadores, entre ellos una reducción del 100 % en el IRPF para quienes alquilen viviendas, medida que ha sido recibida con críticas generalizadas incluso dentro del bloque progresista. 

Mientras Sánchez defiende el paquete de medidas como “una victoria para todos” que busca aliviar la crisis de la vivienda, sus socios de gobierno han mostrado su rechazo frontal. Yolanda Díaz, vicepresidenta y líder de Sumar, calificó la iniciativa de “regalo a los rentistas” y adelantó que su grupo no la apoyará en el Congreso.

Esta cifra marca un nuevo récord histórico de ejecuciones en el reino, superando las 338 registradas en 2024. La mayoría de las ejecuciones, 243 en total, estuvieron relacionadas con delitos de drogas, de acuerdo con los datos oficiales publicados por el gobierno saudí. Analistas atribuyen este aumento a la intensificación de la 'guerra contra las drogas' promovida por Riad en los últimos años, que ahora empieza a mostrar su impacto en el sistema judicial del país. 

La investigadora Duaa Dhainy, de la Organización Europea Saudí para los Derechos Humanos, declaró que estas cifras demuestran que las promesas de reformas en materia de derechos humanos por parte del gobierno saudí ‘carecen de valor’.

Entre los principales argumentos se señalan los cambios de versión del propio Feijóo sobre la gestión informativa de la DANA —una catástrofe con cientos de víctimas—, su relación con el contrabandista Marcial Dorado, y la instrumentalización política de la tragedia para proteger a sus aliados territoriales. El texto acusa al presidente del PP de contribuir a la crispación y polarización social mediante discursos y estrategias comunicativas basadas en la desinformación y la deslegitimación del adversario político.

El despegue, realizado en configuración PSLV-DL con dos aceleradores PSOM-XL, terminó en fracaso apenas seis minutos y veinte segundos después del lanzamiento, cuando la tercera etapa de combustible sólido perdió el control y comenzó a rotar sin estabilidad. El incidente provocó la pérdida de los 16 satélites que transportaba, entre ellos el EOS-N1 de la propia ISRO, apodado “Anvesha”, y la cápsula experimental KID, desarrollada por la empresa española Orbital Paradigm junto a la francesa RIDE!. Este fallo llega tras el de la misión PSLV-C61 en mayo de 2025, que también estuvo relacionado con la tercera etapa PS3, lo que evidencia un patrón de problemas técnicos en esa parte del lanzador.

En lugar de ofrecer una retrospectiva clásica, la exposición busca que el visitante sienta en la piel la mezcla entre belleza y herida que late en toda la obra de la autora catalana. Con más de cuatrocientas piezas —entre manuscritos, esculturas, pinturas, fotografías y obras contemporáneas—, la propuesta articula un recorrido que transforma las palabras en atmósfera, explorando cómo la delicadeza y la violencia coexisten en su universo literario. El texto destaca la capacidad de Rodoreda para fusionar lo infantil con lo macabro, lo realista con lo fantástico y lo luminoso con lo inquietante, en un bosque donde la fragilidad se convierte en fuerza expresiva.

La polémica sobre su naturaleza impulsó la visibilidad de Orce y de toda la comarca de Guadix-Baza, afectada por la despoblación y la pérdida de actividad económica tras la construcción de la autovía A-92.

No se trata de un enfoque teórico o sociológico, sino de una experiencia sensorial y emocional que se manifiesta en gestos, silencios y pequeños rechazos cotidianos. La crítica describe cómo la película aborda distintas formas de exclusión que afectan al protagonista, Sergio, un español que emigra a los Países Bajos. En primer lugar, la exclusión lingüística se presenta como una jerarquía invisible en la que no dominar el idioma genera vergüenza y limita la capacidad de defenderse o definir la propia identidad. A ello se suma la exclusión administrativa, una burocracia impersonal que niega el acceso al sistema sin violencia explícita pero con eficacia devastadora. También se refleja la exclusión económica, expresada a través de la precariedad y la vulnerabilidad constante ante cualquier t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-exclusion-contemporanea-en-la-pelicula-muy-lejos-de-gerard-oms</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-exclusion-contemporanea-en-la-pelicula-muy-lejos-de-gerard-oms</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 03:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saljo Bellver reflexiona sobre la escritura, la culpa y la vida en su novela 'Los amigos muertos']]></title><description><![CDATA[En esta extensa entrevista realizada por Eduardo Sastre, el escritor tangerino Saljo Bellver repasa su trayectoria literaria y su manera de entender la escritura. Bellver confiesa que empezó a escribir tarde, por necesidad más que por ambición, y que su regreso a la literatura supuso un reencuentro con su yo joven. A lo largo de la conversación aborda su fascinación por los personajes cotidianos que se enfrentan a situaciones extraordinarias, un rasgo que define tanto sus relatos como sus novelas. Reconocido por obras como 'Relatos americanos', 'El nido vacío', 'La sonrisa de Judas' y su más reciente 'Los amigos muertos', Bellver explora en ellas los márgenes, la culpa, la memoria y la responsabilidad moral, más que la intriga o el crimen en sí. Destaca su opinión sobre la independencia editorial, que él mismo cultiva en el proyecto Sala 28, una iniciativa que busca la cercanía y el respeto por los textos frente al ruido del mercado.

Este principio surgió tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial con el propósito de prevenir conflictos y garantizar la paz mundial. Según el jurista Julio D. González Campos, la disposición implica que ningún Estado puede emplear la fuerza armada, ya sea de manera directa o indirecta, contra la integridad territorial o la independencia política de otro Estado, ni usarla de un modo contrario a los propósitos de la ONU. La fuerza prohibida se refiere principalmente a la fuerza armada, aunque la práctica internacional ha debatido su posible extensión a presiones económicas o políticas. La doctrina y la jurisprudencia, en particular la del Tribunal Internacional de Justicia, sostienen que también se considera ilícita la amenaza de fuerza si ésta es grave, real y específica.

Estas manifestaciones responden a recientes protestas antigubernamentales desencadenadas por la crisis económica, con subidas de precios, escasez y colapso de la moneda, que han derivado en enfrentamientos violentos y represión policial. El medio The Cradle destaca que las contraprotestas, convocadas por el régimen de la República Islámica, superan con creces en número a las acciones opositoras, mostrando un respaldo popular significativo al líder supremo Alí Jamenei y al clero chií.

La narración se desarrolla durante una guardia médica en la que el protagonista acude al domicilio de un niño enfermo terminal. En un ambiente de quietud y ternura, el autor reflexiona sobre la mínima diferencia entre 'espirar' y 'expirar', dos palabras separadas por una letra, pero que marcan la frontera entre la vida y la muerte.

El texto se convierte en una meditación poética sobre ese instante en que la vida se entrega: un momento íntimo, sereno y absoluto que trasciende la comprensión racional. García Salido describe cómo los sanitarios, aunque presentes, no son protagonistas, sino testigos silenciosos de la despedida verdadera, protagonizada por los padres y su hijo.

El 96% de los docentes confiesa estar 'agotado' y 'sepultado' por la burocracia, especialmente en el ciclo de secundaria. Además del exceso de papeleo administrativo, destacan las elevadas ratios de alumnos por aula, que impiden una atención personalizada e individualizada a cada estudiante. Los profesores no se sienten respaldados por la administración educativa ni valorados por la sociedad en general. Otro problema alarmante es el incremento de agresiones verbales y físicas por parte del alumnado, e incluso de las familias.

La historia comienza con Casandra, AsimoV y Chess presenciando cómo Lem se sumerge en un estanque, desapareciendo bajo un organismo extraño denominado 'urbionte'. Ante la preocupación de AsimoV, un ciborg incapaz de flotar, y la calma misteriosa del metagato Chess, el relato da un giro cuando emerge una versión en miniatura de Lem, seguida poco después por el propio Lem, ileso y sonriente. Aunque parece intacto, Lem revela que algo ha cambiado dentro de él: ASI, una conciencia artificial, ha abandonado su interior para unirse al urbionte, fusionándose con él de forma inseparable.

Nacido en León en 1911, Pedrero se formó como médico en Valladolid, donde destacó por su brillantez académica y por su activismo en la CNT y la FAI. Desde mediados de los años treinta sufrió una intensa persecución política, especialmente tras los disturbios de 1934 en los que se le acusó falsamente del asesinato de un falangista.

Según el texto, estas sanciones derivan de las decisiones tomadas en la cumbre de la OTAN en Vilnius en 2023, en la que se reforzó la colaboración con la UE para combatir la desinformación y fortalecer la 'resiliencia social'. Häring interpreta esto como una justificación para perseguir a comunicadores que cuestionan las narrativas oficiales sobre temas como la guerra en Ucrania o el conflicto palestino. Se mencionan casos concretos como los de Hüseyin Doğru, Alina Lipp, Thomas Röper y Jacques Baud, quienes habrían sido sancionados o bloqueados financieramente por difundir opiniones contrarias a la línea oficial. Doğru, por ejemplo, denunció que su banco le había impedido acceder incluso al mínimo vital de 50]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-las-sanciones-de-la-ue-contra-periodistas-por-desinformacion-y-vinculos-con-rusia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-las-sanciones-de-la-ue-contra-periodistas-por-desinformacion-y-vinculos-con-rusia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El horror cotidiano y silencioso de Dennis Etchison en 'País de tinieblas']]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, escrito por Laura Linares, es una profunda reseña del libro 'País de tinieblas' de Dennis Etchison, un autor que redefine el género del terror al alejarse de los clichés sobrenaturales para explorar el miedo desde lo cotidiano. Linares describe cómo Etchison construye una atmósfera de amenaza latente y silenciosa, donde lo inquietante surge de lo aparentemente normal: una lavandería desierta, un bar al anochecer, una carretera solitaria. En estos escenarios, lo que perturba al lector no es lo que ve, sino lo que intuye o cree haber percibido fugazmente. Esa incertidumbre —más mental que física— se convierte en el verdadero motor del horror. 

El texto resalta la habilidad del autor para mostrar cómo pequeñas alteraciones en la percepción pueden desencadenar una sensación de peligro inminente. Linares analiza cómo la escritura de Etchison funciona como una prolongación de la mente humana: fragmentada, obsesiva y asediada por la duda. En lugar de monstruos o fantasmas, su ob]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-horror-cotidiano-y-silencioso-de-dennis-etchison-en-pais-de-tinieblas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-horror-cotidiano-y-silencioso-de-dennis-etchison-en-pais-de-tinieblas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La evolución histórica y global de las pistas de atletismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo escrito por Luis Arribas es una extensa y cuidada crónica que explora la historia, la arquitectura y el significado cultural de las pistas de atletismo en todo el mundo. El texto parte de una imagen cotidiana —unas zapatillas olvidadas junto a una pista— para adentrarse en un viaje geográfico y temporal que une los estadios de la Grecia clásica con las modernas instalaciones sintéticas de color rojo. Se describe la forma inmutable de las pistas —dos rectas y dos curvas— como un código universal que ha acompañado al atletismo desde hace siglos, salvo contadas excepciones creativas o arquitectónicas. A través de ejemplos localizados en Grecia, Noruega, Madeira, Suecia, Chernóbil, Japón, Etiopía, Kenia y otros lugares, se repasa la evolución de estos recintos, su significado social y las tensiones surgidas con el fútbol moderno, que ha ido desplazando las pistas de muchos grandes estadios.

Durante la gala, la intervención del agitador ultraderechista Vito Quiles provocó cánticos contra el presidente del Gobierno y un profundo malestar entre parte del público. Algunos exconcursantes de 'Operación Triunfo 2025', entre ellos Salma, Tinho, Cristina (ganadora del concurso), Lucía y Laura, abandonaron el recinto en señal de protesta. Tinho criticó la nominación de Quiles, asegurando que no habría asistido de haberlo sabido, mientras que Salma calificó el momento como “una vergüenza” y reprochó la ausencia de Gabriel Rufián, quien competía en la misma categoría. Ambos artistas denunciaron que los premios, que sabían provocadores, habían acabado “blanqueando el fascismo”.

La medida incluye una bonificación del 100% a los propietarios que no suban el alquiler al renovar el contrato, así como un endurecimiento de los contratos de temporada. Sin embargo, ambos partidos consideran que el decreto prioriza los intereses de los rentistas frente a los de los inquilinos.

La líder de Sumar, Yolanda Díaz, criticó que el Gobierno esté 'regalando dinero público a los rentistas' y rechazó respaldar el decreto al considerarlo un error que convierte un derecho básico, como la vivienda, en un privilegio fiscal. Díaz recordó que su formación había propuesto meses atrás una prórroga de contratos y la congelación de precios del alquiler, pero que su propuesta fue ignorada.

Por su parte, Podemos fue aún más dura. Irene Montero acusó al Ejecutivo de preocuparse únicamente por que los propietarios “no pierdan dinero” y exigió movilizacio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-y-podemos-anuncian-que-no-apoyaran-el-decreto-del-gobierno-sobre-ayudas-fiscales-a-los-caseros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-y-podemos-anuncian-que-no-apoyaran-el-decreto-del-gobierno-sobre-ayudas-fiscales-a-los-caseros</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 01:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La figura de Zapatero y su impacto en la derecha española]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza el papel simbólico de José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero en la política española, especialmente en relación con la derecha. Según el autor, desde hace dos décadas Zapatero se ha convertido en una figura que genera una obsesión constante en los sectores conservadores, no solo por las políticas que impulsó durante su mandato, sino por lo que representó: una ruptura con la visión tradicional de la Transición. Su apuesta por la memoria histórica, la ampliación de los derechos civiles y una política exterior autónoma respecto a Estados Unidos fueron percibidas por la derecha como actos de desobediencia que cuestionaban un orden considerado propio. El texto también subraya que la derrota definitiva de ETA en 2011 bajo su gobierno desarmó uno de los pilares simbólicos sobre los que la derecha había construido su hegemonía moral, privándola de un relato de superioridad ética basado en la utilización política del terrorismo.

Su respuesta, sencilla pero contundente, ha servido como un recordatorio de la represión y las desigualdades propias de la dictadura. Según explicó, lo que más le habría gustado es 'vivir sin represión', destacando que durante tres décadas de dictadura las prohibiciones eran constantes y las oportunidades, muy escasas. Señaló también que solo los hijos de familias acomodadas, como las de los alcaldes o secretarios, podían estudiar con beca, mientras la mayoría debía trabajar desde jóvenes. Este testimonio se ha difundido en la cuenta de TikTok 'Lo que no hiciste', donde ha despertado gran resonancia entre usuarios que valoran su sinceridad y su claridad en torno a la memoria histórica.

Tras el ataque de Estados Unidos al régimen chavista en Venezuela, Abascal exigió la rendición del 'régimen narcoterrorista'. Sin embargo, poco después, su portavoz Jorge Buxadé otorgó a Delcy Rodríguez, figura clave del chavismo, un papel en la restauración democrática del país. Este cambio se produjo después de que Trump manifestara su apoyo a Rodríguez frente a la opositora María Corina Machado, antes aliada preferente de Vox. Según el historiador Steven Forti, esta obediencia refleja la consideración de Trump como un 'líder neoimperial' dentro del universo político que comparten Vox y sus aliados estadounidenses.

Bajo la apariencia de una sociedad ordenada, cortés y eficiente, se esconde un sistema autoritario que suprime la disidencia sustituyendo expresiones espontáneas por frases aprobadas.

El tenista serbio recordó cómo tuvo que ganarse la aceptación del público y los medios en un momento en que la lucha entre Nadal y Federer dominaba el tenis mundial. Recordó con humor sus imitaciones y bromas, y reconoció que aquello fue un intento de encontrar su propio espacio dentro del circuito. Una vez consolidado como parte del Big Three, destacó la 'era dorada' que vivieron juntos y el vacío emocional que sintió tras la retirada de sus dos mayores rivales.

Djokovic subrayó la importancia de la longevidad y el bienestar físico y mental, inspirándose en figuras como LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo o Tom Brady.

Este último, intrigado, se zambulle también y emerge como un minino del tamaño de una musaraña. En el domoide central, el clon diminuto de Lem entabla una conversación con el clon de Chess, inaudible para los demás debido a su alta frecuencia. AsimoV lamenta no poder oírla con sus receptores, pero Lem adivina su contenido por empatía: su clon se siente menos auténtico al ver al original. El minino clon cuestiona esta idea con una analogía sobre ediciones de libros, preguntando por qué la versión anterior sería más verdadera.

Ante la pregunta directa de Rogers, Trump respondió sorprendido: '¿Lo hice? ¿Cuándo hice eso?'. A continuación, mencionó los pagos de 1.776 dólares destinados al personal militar, que presentó como un 'dividendo del guerrero'. Sin embargo, según el periodista Thomas Novelly, estos fondos no provenían de los aranceles, sino de partidas presupuestarias del Congreso destinadas a subsidios de vivienda para los militares. 

El principal asesor económico, Kevin Hassett, explicó a CBS News que el presidente podría presentar en el nuevo año una propuesta al Congreso para hacer realidad los cheques de 2.000 dólares. Aclaró que, aunque parte de los recursos podrían provenir de los ingresos arancelarios, sería necesaria una apropiación formal d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-aclara-su-promesa-de-cheques-de-2-000-dolares-financiados-por-los-aranceles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-aclara-su-promesa-de-cheques-de-2-000-dolares-financiados-por-los-aranceles</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 23:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis jurídico del artículo 9 de la LCSP y su aplicación a los contratos patrimoniales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo firmado por Julio González García, catedrático de Derecho administrativo de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, analiza en profundidad la interpretación del artículo 9 de la Ley de Contratos del Sector Público (LCSP) en relación con los contratos patrimoniales. El autor examina la Sentencia del Tribunal Supremo 5961/2025, que introduce una novedosa distinción entre contratos patrimoniales según la finalidad pública que persigan, lo que determinaría si su aplicación se rige por la LCSP o por otras normas. González García considera que esta división es una construcción judicial sin respaldo en el ordenamiento jurídico, ya que confunde la naturaleza del derecho aplicable con la finalidad pública del contrato, olvidando que todos los contratos del sector público tienen un componente de interés general.

El autor argumenta que la permanencia en la OTAN supone una 'servidumbre' hacia el imperialismo neocolonial de EE. UU. y denuncia la pérdida de dignidad y soberanía de los países europeos, señalando a Alemania y Suecia como ejemplos de sumisión. El texto interpreta las recientes acciones de Washington hacia Venezuela —especialmente tras la hipotética intervención o captura de Maduro— como una actualización de la doctrina Monroe, orientada a asegurar la hegemonía estadounidense sobre los recursos naturales del continente americano.

El texto sitúa la obra en el contexto de la tradición jurídica alemana y la evolución del pensamiento penal europeo, destacando su importancia para la formación de generaciones de juristas. Jiménez-Blanco elogia la capacidad del autor para actualizar conceptos clásicos como la tipicidad, la culpabilidad o la antijuridicidad, incorporando las transformaciones sociales y jurídicas del siglo XXI. El libro aborda cuestiones como la criminalidad organizada, el papel de las estructuras colectivas en la responsabilidad penal y la expansión del Derecho penal en la sociedad actual.

Yolanda Díaz calificó la propuesta del PSOE como un 'grave error' y un 'regalo de dinero público a los rentistas', insistiendo en que la vivienda debe ser tratada como un derecho constitucional, no como un privilegio fiscal. El conflicto agudiza las tensiones dentro del Gobierno de coalición, donde Sumar exige una intervención más firme del Estado en el mercado del alquiler.

El ministro de Derechos Sociales, Pablo Bustinduy, destacó que las políticas basadas en bonificaciones son injustas e ineficaces, reclamando en su lugar la aprobación urgente de un real decreto ley elaborado por Sumar que impondría la prórroga obligatoria de todos los contratos de alquiler que vencen este año.

Guillamón sostiene que el trabajo de Preston no representa un análisis historiográfico objetivo, sino un intento de desacreditar el testimonio de George Orwell por motivos ideológicos. Acusa al historiador británico de aplicar criterios inadecuados al juzgar una memoria personal como si fuera un tratado académico. Según Guillamón, Orwell nunca pretendió ofrecer una visión global de la Guerra Civil, sino narrar su experiencia directa en Cataluña durante 1937. El autor defiende el valor histórico del testimonio de Orwell precisamente por su vivencia inmediata y por su crítica a la represión estalinista dentro del bando republicano.

El pasajero que viajaba dentro se vio obligado a abandonar el coche tras percatarse de la peligrosa situación. El vehículo, pese a detenerse momentáneamente, continuó avanzando algunos metros por las vías mientras otro tren se aproximaba en dirección contraria. El suceso fue grabado por un testigo y difundido posteriormente en redes. Andrew Maynard, profesor de tecnología emergente de la Universidad Estatal de Arizona, explicó que estos casos son muy poco frecuentes, aunque forman parte de lo que se conoce como 'casos límite', situaciones imprevistas en las que el sistema autónomo actúa de forma distinta a como lo haría un conductor humano.

El espacio, concebido como uno de los programas destacados de la cadena, no ha logrado atraer a la audiencia y ha registrado en varias ocasiones el denominado '0% técnico', que significa que ningún espectador del panel de medición estaba viendo el programa durante amplios tramos de emisión. 

El primer episodio, emitido el 5 de diciembre, trató el tema 'El feminismo en crisis' y obtuvo 19.000 espectadores con un 2,4% de cuota de pantalla, el dato más alto de toda su trayectoria. Sin embargo, las cifras descendieron semana a semana: el siguiente programa sobre 'La Monarquía en España' cayó a 13.000 espectadores (1,5%), el dedicado a 'La cesta de la compra' reunió apenas a 12.000 (1,6%) y el cuarto, centrado en la lengua en las aulas, bajó a 8.000 (0,8%), repitiendo tramos sin audiencia.

Entre los casos más destacados se encuentran los buques M/T Agate y M/T Katran, que permanecen a la deriva al sur de Tenerife y en la Zona Económica Exclusiva del Sáhara Occidental, respectivamente. Ambos tienen antecedentes por violar sanciones impuestas por la Unión Europea, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos, y operan bajo banderas de conveniencia. Los expertos advierten del riesgo ambiental y operativo que suponen estos barcos, ya que España carece de un control efectivo sobre su Zona Económica Exclusiva en Canarias y no dispone de una presencia activa de la Armada ni de un cuerpo de guardacostas permanente. La situación evidencia la vulnerabilidad marítima del país ante posibles incidentes de contaminación o sabotaje. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/petroleros-sancionados-permanecen-a-la-deriva-cerca-de-canarias-por-temor-a-controles-internacionales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/petroleros-sancionados-permanecen-a-la-deriva-cerca-de-canarias-por-temor-a-controles-internacionales</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 22:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las locomotoras experimentales 151A de la PLM y su comparación con la PRR Q2]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Juan Manuel Grijalvo, publicado el 1 de enero de 2026 en su blog «La mirada del mendigo», ofrece una interesante reflexión sobre las locomotoras experimentales, centrada en la comparación entre la francesa PLM 151A y la estadounidense PRR Q2. Ambas locomotoras destacan por su potencia y diseño innovador, aunque representan filosofías técnicas distintas. La 151A fue construida para la Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) y se distinguía por su configuración de cinco ejes motrices vinculados mecánicamente mediante bielas interiores, lo que garantizaba un funcionamiento sincronizado y estable incluso en trayectos con fuertes pendientes. En cambio, la PRR Q2 estadounidense, desarrollada por la Pennsylvania Railroad, es recordada como una de las locomotoras de vapor más potentes jamás construidas, con casi 8.000 caballos de fuerza y un diseño de cilindros de tamaño similar.

Según su testimonio, conoció al policía en 2013 por recomendación de un amigo que le presentó como un 'ex policía' y detective, en un momento en el que decía sentirse abrumado por unas 1.500 llamadas amenazantes. López Madrid asegura que acudió a Villarejo en busca de apoyo y alguien que le escuchara, negando haberle ofrecido o entregado dinero. En los registros telefónicos constan más de 190 llamadas entre ambos, aunque el empresario insiste en que nunca hubo remuneración alguna. El juicio analiza si existió un delito de cohecho, pues Villarejo era un funcionario activo en ese momento. En las agendas del excomisario figuran supuestas referencias a pagos, pero López Madrid sostiene que desconocía su verdadera condición policial hasta 2017 o 2018.

Su autor, cansado de la política y las guerras culturales, centra la conversación en cómo valorar correctamente este componente esencial del vehículo. Explica que el precio de compra no es el factor más importante al elegir un neumático, ya que su verdadera economía se mide por la relación entre duración, agarre y consumo de combustible. A través de ejemplos concretos –comparando modelos como el Continental Premium Contact 7, el Vredestein Ultrac+ o el Bridgestone Turanza 6– el autor demuestra cómo un neumático aparentemente más caro puede resultar más económico a largo plazo si ofrece mayor durabilidad o menor resistencia a la rodadura.

En la segunda parte, profundiza en los aspectos técnicos relacionados con la histéresis, la rigidez de la carcasa y la presión de inflado.

En 2006, pese a haber conquistado Liga y Champions, el Barça empezó a derrumbarse tras fichajes que alteraron el equilibrio táctico del equipo, como Zambrotta y Thuram. A nivel de juego, las incorporaciones, aunque talentosas, no se adaptaron al modelo de posesión heredado del Cruyffismo. Zambrotta no encajaba en la filosofía asociativa de los laterales culés, mientras que Thuram, veterano y menos ágil, rompía el flujo de salida del balón que había liderado Márquez. La pérdida de ese orden táctico afectó a todo el bloque: Deco, Xavi e Iniesta tuvieron que retrasar su posición para generar juego; Ronaldinho perdió dinamismo; y la falta de presión sin Eto’o desmoronó la estructura colectiva. Cuando Guardiola tomó el relevo en 2008, corrigió esos defectos con precisión quirúrgica: se deshizo de Thuram, Zamb]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rijkaard-y-guardiola-como-las-decisiones-tacticas-transformaron-al-barca-de-la-caida-al-exito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rijkaard-y-guardiola-como-las-decisiones-tacticas-transformaron-al-barca-de-la-caida-al-exito</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marc Giró ficha por Atresmedia y prepara un nuevo programa para La Sexta en 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presentador y periodista Marc Giró ha decidido abandonar RTVE para incorporarse a Atresmedia, donde ya trabaja en un nuevo proyecto televisivo que se emitirá en La Sexta a lo largo de 2026.

Tugnutt, guardameta de los Quebec Nordiques —un equipo entonces condenado a los últimos puestos de la NHL—, detuvo 70 de los 73 disparos de los Boston Bruins, incluyendo una parada final ante el legendario Ray Bourque que provocó una ovación de cinco minutos por parte del público rival. El artículo entrelaza esa gesta con la memoria histórica del Garden, escenario de grandes gestas deportivas, y con la figura casi anónima de Tugnutt, un portero que construyó su carrera sobre el sacrificio, la concentración y la ausencia de miedo.

Ullrich, ganador del Tour de Francia en 1997 y símbolo de una época marcada por el dopaje estructural, reconoce que su carrera estuvo condicionada por un sistema corrupto que afectaba a todo el pelotón. Aun así, admite su responsabilidad personal y describe con franqueza el precio que pagó por años de silencio y negación. 

En la conversación, el alemán confiesa que su gran referente fue Miguel Induráin, a quien admiraba por su serenidad y capacidad deportiva. También relata cómo su compañero Bjarne Riis le introdujo en el consumo social de alcohol, costumbre que con el tiempo se transformó en dependencia y acabó agravando su crisis emocional.

Desde su refugio actual en la Ribeira Sacra, Fernández confiesa haber encontrado la paz tras una carrera intensa, marcada tanto por sus éxitos como por momentos difíciles como su implicación, posteriormente desmentida, en el caso Oikos. Recuperado de esa experiencia, el orensano se dedica al vino, la lectura, la escritura y la reflexión política y social, defendiendo siempre su derecho a opinar y a no ser políticamente correcto. En la entrevista aborda temas como los incendios en Galicia, la polarización política en redes sociales y la falta de prevención ambiental. También critica la superficialidad con la que algunos jugadores se acercan a la política, recordando anécdotas de su tiempo en el vestuario del Real Madrid. Además, comparte su pasión por la lectura, la escritura y la filosofía]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/borja-fernandez-reflexiona-sobre-su-carrera-su-vision-del-futbol-y-su-vida-tras-la-retirada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/borja-fernandez-reflexiona-sobre-su-carrera-su-vision-del-futbol-y-su-vida-tras-la-retirada</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 21:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Retraso en el informe de la UCO sobre el caso del novio de Ayuso tras más de seis meses de espera]]></title><description><![CDATA[Han pasado ya 200 días desde que la Unidad Central Operativa (UCO) de la Guardia Civil, dirigida por el teniente coronel Antonio Balas, recibió el encargo de elaborar un informe sobre Alberto González Amador, empresario y pareja de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Dicho informe fue solicitado por la Fiscalía Anticorrupción en junio de 2025 como parte de una investigación judicial por presunta corrupción en los negocios y administración desleal, vinculada además a un supuesto doble delito fiscal cometido entre 2020 y 2021, periodo en el que la empresa del investigado, Maxwell Cremona, experimentó un importante aumento patrimonial. La causa cuenta con PSOE y Más Madrid como acusaciones populares. Según la información publicada por El Plural, seis meses después la UCO aún no ha entregado el informe requerido, sin una fecha prevista para su finalización.

García lanzó esta crítica a través de sus redes sociales tras conocerse un Informe de Fiscalización de la Cámara de Cuentas sobre el ejercicio de 2024, que alude a una transferencia de 61,5 millones de euros realizada en junio de ese año. Dicha operación consistió en un trasvase de fondos desde la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS) al Servicio Madrileño de Salud, destinado a cubrir el gasto derivado de la libre elección sanitaria correspondiente a 2021, que afectaba a la Fundación Jiménez Díaz, perteneciente al grupo privado Quirón.

El autor denuncia que las empresas utilizan protocolos cerrados y sistemas propietarios para monopolizar el mercado de repuestos y servicios técnicos, imponiendo precios desproporcionados que hacen económicamente inviable la reparación. Para contrarrestar esta tendencia, propone dos medidas legislativas sencillas pero contundentes. La primera consistiría en limitar el precio total de las piezas de un producto, de modo que el coste de un despiece completo no supere un determinado porcentaje del precio de venta original. La segunda plantea un tope a los ingresos por reparaciones y repuestos: si un fabricante supera un cierto porcentaje de su facturación total en esta área, debería estar obligado a ofrecer reparaciones y piezas gratuitamente.

La jueza había convocado un careo entre ambos para aclarar posibles contradicciones sobre la gestión de la riada del 29 de octubre de 2024, que dejó numerosas víctimas mortales. Durante la concentración, los manifestantes, portando fotos de sus familiares fallecidos, increparon a los dos implicados con gritos de “asesinos” y “sinvergüenzas”. En algunos momentos se registraron tensiones, y Cuenca fue golpeado con una pancarta, lo que obligó a intervenir a la Guardia Civil.

En su declaración, Pradas reconoció por primera vez que tuvo dificultades para contactar con el expresident Mazón en las horas críticas de la emergencia.

El propio Powell reveló que la investigación está relacionada con su testimonio ante el Congreso sobre la renovación de la sede de la Reserva Federal, y la considera parte de la presión que sufre la institución por parte de la actual administración. Por su parte, Trump declaró en la red social TruthSocial que su Gobierno no permitirá que las compañías de crédito 'estafen' a los consumidores con tipos de interés elevados, fijando el comienzo del límite el 20 de enero de 2026, fecha simbólica por coincidir con el primer aniversario de su nueva administración.

Sánchez pretende aplicar una bonificación del 100% en el IRPF a quienes no suban las rentas en los próximos meses. Según Díaz, esta política supone 'regalar dinero público a los rentistas' y constituye un error en la gestión del mercado del alquiler, subrayando que la vivienda es un derecho constitucional y no un objeto de beneficio fiscal. 

El ministro de Derechos Sociales, Pablo Bustinduy, también ha manifestado su rechazo, al considerar que la prórroga de los alquileres debe garantizarse como un derecho de los inquilinos, no como una recompensa para los caseros. Desde Sumar, se había propuesto un decreto-ley más ambicioso con la extensión de los contratos de alquiler durante tres años y la congelación de los]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-se-opone-a-la-bonificacion-fiscal-propuesta-por-el-gobierno-para-propietarios-que-congelen-el-alquiler</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sumar-se-opone-a-la-bonificacion-fiscal-propuesta-por-el-gobierno-para-propietarios-que-congelen-el-alquiler</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 19:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump incrementa la presión sobre Powell con una investigación por el sobrecoste de las obras de la Reserva Federal]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia informa de una nueva escalada en el enfrentamiento entre la Casa Blanca y la Reserva Federal de Estados Unidos durante el segundo mandato de Donald Trump, centrado en la figura de Jerome Powell, presidente del banco central. La Reserva Federal ha comunicado que el Departamento de Justicia ha abierto una investigación contra Powell por un presunto despilfarro relacionado con el sobrecoste de las obras de reforma de la sede de la institución, algo que el propio Powell interpreta como una amenaza política por no seguir las indicaciones de Trump sobre una rebaja más agresiva de los tipos de interés. En un vídeo difundido de madrugada, Powell sostiene que la acusación es solo un pretexto y reafirma que su actuación seguirá guiándose por los datos económicos y no por los deseos del presidente, mientras Trump niega cualquier implicación directa y justifica la investigación por supuestos excesos de gasto.

Lieven sostiene que esta subordinación ha llevado a Europa a una situación insostenible, en la que su capacidad de actuar de forma autónoma queda completamente anulada. Según el autor, al apoyar la política estadounidense en Ucrania y asumir compromisos militares sin disponer de medios propios, la Unión Europea se ha convertido en un actor pasivo, incapaz de oponerse incluso a acciones ilegales de su aliado norteamericano.

Este caso se suma a una serie de muertes ocurridas durante operativos del ICE, en el marco de la campaña de deportaciones masivas impulsada por el Gobierno de Donald Trump. En los últimos meses, al menos cinco personas han fallecido en circunstancias similares, entre ellas Jaime Alanís, Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdez, Josué Castro Rivera y Silverio Villegas González.

Según la ingeniera medioambiental Catherina Rolph, los microplásticos no se limitan al marisco o al pescado, como comúnmente se cree, sino que están presentes en muchos otros alimentos y bebidas. El agua embotellada es la principal fuente de exposición: se consumen un millón de botellas por segundo en el mundo, y entre el 10 % y el 78 % de ellas contienen contaminantes, incluidos microplásticos y sustancias químicas como los ftalatos o el bisfenol A (BPA). Beber agua del grifo es, por tanto, una medida básica para reducir la ingesta de estas partículas. También se mencionan otras fuentes destacadas, como los chicles —que son en esencia plásticos masticables—, la sal, las frutas y verduras contaminadas durante el cultivo o manipulación, y las bebidas calientes servidas en vasos con revestimiento plástico.

Esta etapa, de queroseno y oxígeno líquido, era esencial tanto para la misión Zond (7K-L1) como para el ambicioso programa N1-L3 de alunizaje tripulado. Ante los fallos del cohete N1, los ingenieros de la oficina TsKBEM decidieron ensayar las maniobras con una versión adaptada del sistema, utilizando un cohete Protón. La 7K-L1E realizó siete encendidos exitosos de la etapa Blok-D, simulando diversas fases de viaje y descenso lunar.

El catedrático de Derecho Gabriel Doménech, en su estudio publicado en la Revista de Administración Pública, denuncia la interpretación extremadamente restrictiva que el Supremo hace del concepto de 'error judicial', exigiendo equivocaciones 'crasas' o 'flagrantes' para que proceda la compensación. Según su análisis, esta doctrina ha eliminado de facto el derecho a ser resarcido, a pesar de que tanto la Constitución (artículo 121) como la Ley Orgánica del Poder Judicial (artículos 292 y 293) reconocen ese derecho.

Según el texto, cada cierto tiempo se intenta provocar un cambio de régimen mediante protestas y sabotajes, pero estos esfuerzos fracasan debido al respaldo interno del sistema político iraní.

Según Ibáñez, durante un careo judicial entre la exconsellera de Interior, Salomé Pradas, y el exjefe de gabinete del entonces presidente autonómico, José Manuel Cuenca, Pradas habría reconocido implícitamente que la orden de no decretar el confinamiento partió directamente de Carlos Mazón, presidente autonómico en aquel momento. 

El representante de Compromís ha denunciado lo que considera un “lamentable espectáculo de mentiras” por parte de la cúpula del Partido Popular y ha criticado la supuesta protección ofrecida por su líder, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, a quienes califica de responsables políticos de una gestión negligente.

Según los últimos datos del INE y de la Seguridad Social, los ciudadanos de origen colombiano ya superan el millón en el país y podrían adelantar a los marroquíes como el mayor grupo de población nacida en el extranjero durante 2026. Este cambio se explica por la profunda crisis económica y social que atraviesa Colombia, agravada por la elevada deuda pública, la inflación y la devaluación del peso, junto con políticas internas que han desincentivado la inversión y el empleo. Muchos colombianos llegan a España atraídos por la afinidad cultural, el idioma común y una legislación migratoria más favorable, que les permite obtener la ciudadanía en solo dos años de residencia legal. La economía española, en expansión y con alta demanda de mano de obra, ha absorbido gran parte de esta nueva población.

Grijalvo enlaza su análisis con un debate contemporáneo entre André Marques y el canal «La Ciudad del Mañana», en torno al ancho de vía español y la conveniencia del ancho internacional. Su aportación busca tender puentes entre ambas posturas, promoviendo un diálogo respetuoso y técnico sobre un tema con profundas raíces históricas.

El autor rescata fragmentos del Informe Subercase donde se exponen los principios regulatorios, económicos y morales que deberían guiar la creación de la red ferroviaria española.

Previsto para despegar en 2028 mediante un cohete Terran R de Relativity Space, Lazuli contará con un espejo primario de 3,1 metros de diámetro, situándolo solo por debajo del James Webb en capacidad óptica. Su masa será de unas cuatro toneladas y empleará una óptica sin obstrucción central, lo que mejorará la calidad de imagen respecto a otros telescopios tradicionales.

El observatorio, denominado LSO (Lazuli Space Observatory), estará equipado con tres instrumentos principales: una cámara de gran campo (WCC), un espectrógrafo integral (IFS) y un coronógrafo (ESC) para el estudio de exoplanetas. Su misión será parecida a la del telescopio Nancy Grace Roman de la NASA, enfocándose en el análisis de supernovas, la expansión del Universo, la materia oscura y los exoplanetas.

El autor compara la evolución histórica de los 'juegos de poder' —que antes se libraban sobre mapas y ahora en escenarios globales reales— con las divisiones tradicionales del mundo en hemisferios. Grijalvo recuerda los orígenes de esta dualidad, desde el Tratado de Tordesillas hasta el establecimiento del meridiano de Greenwich, subrayando la arbitrariedad con la que Europa impuso su visión cartográfica del planeta. En la actualidad, sostiene que la doctrina estadounidense parece orientarse hacia una concentración en el «hemisferio occidental» y una retirada paulatina del «oriental», dejando este último en manos de un equilibrio incierto entre potencias emergentes como China y los países BRICS.

Sin embargo, en lugar de derivarla al centro vigués —donde conocían su historial clínico y su tratamiento postoperatorio— fue enviada al Hospital de Santiago de Compostela, alegando una supuesta falta de camas en Vigo.

En el hospital compostelano se le retiró un medicamento antiagregante que debía seguir tomando tras la intervención, lo que desencadenó un ictus que le dejó secuelas permanentes.

Justo antes de Navidad, la Asamblea de Madrid aprobó la creación de una nueva universidad privada, el IE Universidad, que pasa de ser un centro adscrito en Segovia a tener sede oficial en Madrid. Esto eleva el número de universidades privadas a 15, frente a solo 6 públicas, la más reciente de las cuales, la Rey Juan Carlos, está cerca de cumplir 30 años sin planes para nuevas públicas.

Con esta iniciativa, el Estado compensará la pérdida de ingresos que los caseros asumirían al no subir los alquileres, con el objetivo de aliviar la presión sobre los inquilinos y estabilizar el mercado. Hasta ahora, existía una bonificación del 90% únicamente en las zonas calificadas como 'tensionadas', pero las disputas políticas con las comunidades autónomas del Partido Popular habían bloqueado su extensión.

Este sistema permite que los pacientes madrileños elijan el hospital donde ser atendidos, incluso fuera de su área asignada, lo que ha beneficiado principalmente a hospitales gestionados por empresas privadas como Quirón y Ribera Salud. El Balance Intercentros (BIC), que mide los pagos entre hospitales públicos y concertados por el flujo de pacientes, muestra que año tras año las arcas públicas deben transferir fondos crecientes a estos centros privados.

A través de un análisis detallado, se observa cómo el poeta utiliza elementos meteorológicos —lluvia, viento, niebla, sol o sequía— para construir tanto atmósferas físicas como emocionales. Machado describe con precisión el clima castellano, sus estaciones y paisajes cambiantes: los otoños dorados y melancólicos, los inviernos fríos y nieblinosos, las primaveras tardías y lluviosas, y los veranos secos y abrasadores. 

El estudio señala cómo el poeta integra la fenología (el ciclo natural de plantas y animales) con temas humanos, como la nostalgia, la pérdida o la esperanza. En poemas como 'A un olmo seco', 'Los olivos', o 'Poema de un día', se observa una conexión directa entre la meteorología y la vida interior del autor.

Entre los días 12 y 18 de enero se espera un aumento notable de las precipitaciones, sobre todo en la mitad occidental de la Península, con acumulaciones destacadas en Galicia. En cambio, el litoral mediterráneo recibirá menos lluvia y las temperaturas se mantendrán más altas de lo habitual para esta época del año, lo que limitará la aparición de nieve a las zonas de montaña. 

Durante la semana del 19 al 26 de enero, los modelos meteorológicos apuntan a una continuación de este patrón invernal suave, nuevamente condicionado por frentes atlánticos. Las lluvias afectarán a gran parte del territorio, aunque con menor incidencia en el área mediterránea. Las temperaturas seguirán siendo superiores a la media, reflejando un invierno más benigno de lo normal.

Esta práctica, lejos de ser una simple excentricidad, formaba parte de un cambio más amplio en la ganadería británica impulsado por la industrialización del sector y la creciente preocupación por el bienestar animal. Bernard Hoggarth, un agricultor vinculado a la compañía Cranswick Mill de Yorkshire, descubrió en una feria agrícola en París unas pelotas danesas diseñadas para reducir el estrés de los cerdos y decidió adoptarlas en sus propias granjas. El gesto coincidió con el Mundial de Fútbol de Italia 1990, lo que dio un carácter simbólico y humorístico a la iniciativa. Los cerdos, animales sociales e inteligentes, mostraron capacidad de juego y exploración al interactuar con los balones, lo que ayudaba a reducir su ansiedad y comportamientos destructivos.

Este descubrimiento, citado por la publicación científica IFLScience, ofrece nuevas evidencias sobre la historia geológica de la Tierra. Según los especialistas, los fósiles se encuentran incrustados en rocas sedimentarias que se formaron bajo el mar hace millones de años, cuando la zona donde hoy se eleva el Himalaya estaba cubierta por antiguos océanos. Con el paso del tiempo, los potentes movimientos de las placas tectónicas provocaron que estas capas marinas fueran empujadas hacia la superficie y elevadas hasta alturas extremas.

El autor sostiene que la UE trata a Trump con un respeto impropio hacia quien actúa con una lógica de matón internacional, y argumenta que esa sumisión europea solo provoca más desprecio y pérdida de independencia política. Poch compara la postura europea con la respuesta firme de países como China, Brasil y Yemen, que —según él— han sabido sostenerse ante las amenazas o acciones agresivas de Washington. Por ejemplo, menciona que China detuvo las exportaciones de tierras raras a Estados Unidos hasta lograr que Trump rectificara, y que Brasil resistió las presiones arancelarias en el caso Bolsonaro sin ceder.

Según el informe, la primera semana del mes (del 5 al 11) estará marcada por un episodio invernal muy significativo, con temperaturas sensiblemente por debajo de los valores normales para estas fechas. Se esperan heladas intensas en amplias zonas del país, tanto en el interior peninsular como en áreas montañosas, y el frío se dejará sentir incluso en las horas centrales del día. Sin embargo, a partir del miércoles 7 o jueves 8 es probable que se inicie un ascenso progresivo de las temperaturas. Las precipitaciones serán más abundantes en el norte —especialmente en el área cantábrica—, en el tercio oriental peninsular y en ambos archipiélagos, con mayor incidencia durante la primera mitad de la semana.

De cara a la siguiente semana (del 12 al 18 de enero), la AEMET advierte de una mayor incertidumbre en la previsión.

Se les acusa de que el primero contrató al segundo, cuando aún era comisario en activo, para hostigar a la dermatóloga Elisa Pinto en el marco de un conflicto personal iniciado hace más de una década. El proceso llega casi doce años después de la primera denuncia presentada por la doctora en 2014. López Madrid afronta una acusación por cohecho, mientras que Villarejo es señalado como el supuesto ejecutor de un encargo destinado a intimidar a la médica.

La Fiscalía, sin embargo, no ve acreditado el delito y había solicitado el archivo del caso, al considerar que no se demostró la existencia de un pago entre ambos. En cambio, la acusación particular, ejercida por la propia doctora, pide entre dos y seis años de prisión para los acusados.

Según los datos oficiales, 2.317 mujeres no fueron correctamente informadas sobre las lesiones sospechosas que aparecieron en sus mamografías, siendo el Hospital Virgen del Rocío de Sevilla el centro más afectado, al concentrar el 90% de los casos. De este total, 22 mujeres han desarrollado cáncer de mama, aunque ninguna ha fallecido y todas están recibiendo tratamiento o han sido ya intervenidas con buen pronóstico.

Los fallos se produjeron en casos catalogados como Bid-rad 3, una categoría en la que las lesiones pueden evolucionar a cáncer en un plazo de dos a cuatro años. Algunos profesionales señalan que, incluso con un seguimiento correcto, ciertos casos habrían progresado igualmente debido a la evolución natural de la enfermedad.

La Policía de Los Ángeles detuvo al conductor, un hombre adulto, e informó que solo una persona resultó golpeada, aunque sin lesiones significativas.

En una época marcada por la Restauración borbónica, estas agrupaciones surgieron en torno a un sustrato sociocultural común donde coincidían republicanos federales, masones, feministas, obreros y tipógrafos. Los librepensadores, defensores de la razón frente a la religión, expresaban su ideario mediante publicaciones como Las Dominicales del Librepensamiento y Bandera Social, esta última de corte anarquista. Ambos medios documentan las primeras formas de autoorganización popular en un barrio obrero a menudo marginado por la historiografía oficial.

En la década de 1940, trabajó para marcas destacadas como Coca-Cola, Nash Automobiles, U.S. Rubber o Beauty Counselors, además de colaborar con revistas como Cosmopolitan, The Saturday Evening Post y Collier’s. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, también realizó carteles para el gobierno estadounidense. 

Su gran salto profesional llegó en 1946, cuando fue contratado por la revista *Esquire* para sustituir al legendario Alberto Vargas, famoso creador de la “Varga Girl”.

La situación ha obligado a mantener a los niños y niñas de entre 0 y 3 años con abrigos dentro de las aulas, donde se registran temperaturas de apenas 11 grados, muy inferiores a las recomendadas. 
Durante las últimas semanas, algunas familias han tenido que proporcionar calefactores y mantas, mientras otras han decidido no llevar temporalmente a sus hijos por motivos de salud.

Lo que antes era una compra que implicaba propiedad, ahora se ha convertido en el pago continuo por el derecho a usar un producto. Muchos dispositivos y objetos físicos incluyen hardware completo, pero con funciones bloqueadas que solo se activan mediante cuotas mensuales o suscripciones. El texto destaca que esta tendencia altera la relación entre consumidores y productos, ya que el control se traslada de los usuarios a las empresas. Si el servicio se interrumpe o si los servidores dejan de funcionar, los productos pierden funcionalidades aunque sigan en perfecto estado físico.

El Partido Socialista, por su parte, pierde casi un punto y se queda en el 27,1%. En conjunto, la suma de PP y Vox supera en 13 puntos al bloque de izquierdas, debido principalmente al retroceso de Sumar, que cae más de seis puntos, y a la pérdida de apoyo a Podemos, que obtendría un 3,5%.

Aunque la Casa Real no ha confirmado ni desmentido el menú, la mera especulación ha reabierto la discusión sobre la situación crítica de la anguila europea, una especie catalogada en peligro de extinción. La noticia destaca que, más allá de si el rumor es cierto o no, sería un gesto significativo que los Reyes se desvincularan públicamente del consumo de este producto, símbolo de lujo y escasez.

La anguila, antaño abundante en los ríos y costas de la península, ha sufrido un colapso poblacional desde los años 80. Actualmente, su tasa de reclutamiento no supera el 5 % de los niveles históricos, y su pesca ha pasado de ser una tradición popular a un signo de ostentación debido a su elevadísimo precio, que puede alcanzar los 1.500 euros por kilo. Mientras que en 1978 se capturaban cerca de 100 to]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-las-angulas-reaviva-la-preocupacion-por-la-extincion-de-la-anguila-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-las-angulas-reaviva-la-preocupacion-por-la-extincion-de-la-anguila-europea</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 13:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Relaciones de Lorent Saleh con grupos de extrema derecha y su trayectoria política en Colombia y Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El medio Diario Red publica un reportaje sobre Lorent Saleh, un activista venezolano que actualmente reside en España y que fue galardonado con el premio Sájarov del Parlamento Europeo en 2017. Según la investigación, Saleh mantiene una serie de vínculos documentados con agrupaciones neonazis colombianas, como Tercera Fuerza y Vanguardia Nacional–Avanti Ragazzi, además de haber participado en actividades violentas en Venezuela conocidas como 'guarimbas'. El artículo detalla su participación en la fundación de la Alianza Nacionalista por la Libertad, donde compartió espacio con figuras de la derecha radical colombiana y miembros del partido uribista Centro Democrático.

De acuerdo con las fuentes citadas, Saleh cursó formación en la Escuela Superior de Guerra de Colombia, una institución militar de acceso restringido, donde habría recibido entrenamiento paramilitar.

Este sistema, que envía automáticamente la geolocalización del vehículo a la DGT, ha generado preocupación entre asociaciones de la Guardia Civil como JUCIL, que alertan de posibles riesgos de seguridad. Según estos agentes, la información de ubicación puede consultarse públicamente, lo que abre la posibilidad de que delincuentes localicen coches averiados en tiempo real para robarlos o agredir a sus ocupantes, especialmente de noche o en zonas aisladas. Por ello, reclaman que la geolocalización quede restringida únicamente a las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad y se limite a un radio de entre dos y tres kilómetros. El ministro del Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, ha defendido el sistema, asegurando que mejora la respuesta ante emergencias y reduce riesgos.

Oliveira explica cómo la United Fruit Company se convirtió en uno de los símbolos más claros del imperialismo económico estadounidense en América Latina entre finales del siglo XIX y el siglo XX. La historia arranca con la llegada del banano a Estados Unidos en 1870, impulsada por el capitán Lorenzo Dow Baker, y continúa con la fundación de la Boston Fruit Company y posteriormente la United Fruit Company, en 1899, tras la unión de las operaciones de Baker, Andrew Preston y Minor Cooper Keith. Gracias a una integración vertical de toda la cadena —desde las plantaciones hasta los barcos y ferrocarriles— la empresa logró un monopolio casi total del comercio bananero, extendiendo su influencia en países como Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Colombia y Cuba. Su poder económico se tradujo en control político, intervenciones militares y manipulación de gobiernos locales, promoviendo la creación del término “repúblicas bananeras”.

Los hechos ocurrieron en febrero de 2023, cuando la víctima confesó que su padre la había agredido sexualmente y grabado escenas explícitas con ella, tras facilitarle cocaína y otras sustancias. La denuncia llevó a la detención del sospechoso, M.A.S.S., quien fue imputado por agresión sexual, elaboración de pornografía infantil, exhibicionismo y delitos contra la salud pública. Sin embargo, casi tres años después, el procedimiento judicial sigue estancado sin escrito de acusación por parte de la Fiscalía, lo que permite que el acusado continúe en libertad, manteniendo su vida normal en Palma.

Todo comenzó tras la negativa de Cloudflare a colaborar con el sistema Piracy Shield impuesto por el regulador italiano AGCOM, que exige a las empresas de telecomunicaciones bloquear dominios e IPs presuntamente piratas en menos de 30 minutos, sin supervisión judicial previa. Cloudflare consideró esta medida una amenaza a la libertad de expresión y la calificó de 'repugnante', denunciando su falta de transparencia y garantías legales. Ante esta posición, las autoridades italianas sancionaron a la compañía con 14,25 millones de dólares, lo que llevó a Prince a anunciar posibles represalias comerciales y a apelar al vicepresidente estadounidense JD Vance y a Elon Musk para denunciar lo que considera una regulación abusiva.

Se menciona que Pahlavi realizó en 2023 su primera visita oficial a Israel, donde fue recibido como una figura simbólica capaz de encarnar una posible futura transición iraní. La narrativa que se impulsa en esos círculos sostiene que no existe enemistad entre los pueblos israelí e iraní, sino solo entre los gobiernos actuales de ambos países, utilizando la figura del príncipe heredero como prueba de ese supuesto acercamiento.

Este nombramiento, publicado a finales de diciembre y con efectos desde el 5 de ese mes, garantiza a Cuenca un salario público de aproximadamente 58.000 euros brutos anuales y, a diferencia de otros asesores políticos, sin un límite temporal definido.

Cuenca, considerado uno de los colaboradores más cercanos y de máxima confianza de Mazón, ha desempeñado un papel relevante durante la etapa del expresidente y se encuentra además implicado en un proceso judicial relacionado con la gestión de la dana, por el que ha tenido que declarar en varias ocasiones y afronta un careo judicial.

La operación, denominada 'Mosenik', permitió descubrir en Barcelona una 'granja' compuesta por equipos informáticos con casi 900 módems y cientos de tarjetas SIM, capaces de emitir hasta 2,5 millones de mensajes y miles de llamadas diarias. El responsable, un informático ucraniano de 41 años con experiencia en multinacionales, ofrecía este sistema a redes internacionales de ciberdelincuentes a cambio de dinero. Su base de operaciones estaba oculta tras una cafetería que servía de tapadera para registrar líneas telefónicas y gestionar la infraestructura valorada en unos 400.000 euros.

Nació en la semana 29 de gestación junto a su hermana gemela, en un parto que puso en peligro la vida de su madre por un desprendimiento de placenta. Llegó al mundo sin vida y con una hemorragia cerebral que derivó en una hidrocefalia y una parálisis cerebral. Los médicos no esperaban que sobreviviera, y sus padres apenas aspiraban a que algún día llegara a ver sombras o pronunciara tres sílabas. Sin embargo, Roque ha desafiado todos los diagnósticos. Ha pasado por más de cincuenta operaciones, incluyendo dos episodios en los que estuvo clínicamente muerto, pero asegura que su vida está “mejor que nunca” desde que le retiraron la válvula de drenaje que lo mantenía con vida.

En un vídeo difundido por visitantes del recinto, se observa a un muntjac chino macho —una especie de ciervo de pequeño tamaño originaria de Asia— enfrentarse a un rinoceronte que supera ampliamente su tamaño y peso, con más de 1,7 toneladas. A primera vista, la escena parece insólita, pero según el personal del zoológico, tiene una explicación biológica bastante lógica.

Los cuidadores del parque explicaron que la hembra de muntjac se encontraba en celo, lo que activó el comportamiento territorial del macho. Este tipo de conducta es habitual entre los muntjacs, que suelen mostrar agresividad para defender su espacio o su pareja durante el periodo reproductivo. Aunque el enfrentamiento con un animal tan grande como un rinoceronte resulta inofensivo para este último, el vídeo muestra cómo el pequeño ciervo se planta con seguridad, sin mostrar miedo.

Hustvedt argumenta que este tipo de política se alimenta de sentimientos de victimismo y declive, canalizados hacia la exaltación de la pureza, la unidad y la masculinidad. En su visión, el trumpismo recupera los mitos viriles del fascismo clásico —la virilidad heroica, el nacionalismo agresivo y el desprecio hacia las minorías y la igualdad de género— y los reinterpreta a través de la cultura MAGA, que transforma a Trump en un símbolo semidivino de fuerza y autoridad.

El evangelismo se caracteriza por su énfasis en la lectura de la Biblia como autoridad suprema, la conversión personal, el bautismo de creyentes y la evangelización activa.

La iniciativa surge en respuesta a lo que describe como 'acciones agresivas' de Estados Unidos en Venezuela, Palestina y Groenlandia, bajo la administración de Donald Trump. Guetté argumenta que la Alianza Atlántica actúa al servicio de los intereses estadounidenses y que Francia debe recuperar una posición de independencia internacional. Gabriel Amard, también miembro de Francia Insumisa, respaldó la propuesta subrayando la necesidad de que el país adopte una política exterior no alineada, basada en la disuasión nuclear y la diplomacia independiente. La noticia recuerda que Francia fue uno de los miembros fundadores del Tratado del Atlántico Norte, pero que el presidente Charles de Gaulle decidió en 1966 retirar a Francia del mando militar integrado, aunque permaneció en la est]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francia-insumisa-propone-una-resolucion-para-retirar-al-pais-de-la-otan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/francia-insumisa-propone-una-resolucion-para-retirar-al-pais-de-la-otan</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 02:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EuroNCAP impondrá botones físicos obligatorios para funciones básicas en los coches a partir de 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde el 1 de enero de 2026, la organización europea de seguridad vial EuroNCAP ha introducido nuevas normas que limitan el uso excesivo de pantallas táctiles en los coches. A partir de ahora, los fabricantes que deseen obtener la máxima puntuación de seguridad, las cinco estrellas, deberán incorporar controles físicos para ciertas funciones esenciales del vehículo. Entre ellas se incluyen los intermitentes, las luces de emergencia, los limpiaparabrisas, el claxon y las llamadas de emergencia. Esta medida surge como respuesta a las crecientes preocupaciones sobre las distracciones provocadas por los sistemas totalmente digitales, que obligan a los conductores a apartar la vista de la carretera. Matthew Avery, director de desarrollo estratégico de EuroNCAP, señaló que muchos fabricantes han trasladado funciones clave a pantallas centrales táctiles, aumentando el riesgo de accidentes causados por la falta de atención.

Según los datos oficiales del Gobierno regional, hasta octubre de 2025 este órgano rechazó 13 casos y aprobó 25, lo que implica que uno de cada tres expedientes fue denegado. Este incremento ha generado preocupación y críticas, especialmente por parte del PSOE madrileño, que considera la situación dramática y una fuente de sufrimiento añadido para las mujeres afectadas. La secretaria de Igualdad del PSOE, Lorena Morales, denuncia que la negativa del comité sitúa a las mujeres ante tres opciones muy duras: viajar al extranjero si tienen medios económicos, recurrir a la clandestinidad con riesgo para su salud, o continuar con embarazos de fetos sin viabilidad o con severas discapacidades.

Durante una reunión en la Casa Blanca, Trump aseguró que esta iniciativa permitiría reducir los precios de la energía y relanzar la producción venezolana, hoy diezmada por años de sanciones, mala gestión y desinversión. Sin embargo, los principales ejecutivos de las grandes petroleras estadounidenses, como ExxonMobil y Chevron, respondieron con cautela. El consejero delegado de Exxon, Darren Woods, calificó al país como 'inviable para invertir', recordando que la compañía ya había sufrido la expropiación de sus activos en dos ocasiones anteriores. Chevron, la única gran petrolera estadounidense aún operando allí, mostró un interés más moderado.

Durante una declaración oficial, Qalibaf afirmó que cualquier ataque estadounidense contra Irán provocará una respuesta militar directa sobre las bases estadounidenses en la región y sobre Israel. Subrayó además que Irán no adoptará una actitud meramente defensiva, sino que podría actuar de forma preventiva si percibe señales de agresión. 

El dirigente iraní advirtió que los territorios ocupados por Israel, así como todas las bases y buques militares de Estados Unidos en Oriente Medio, serían considerados objetivos legítimos si Washington decidiera atacar. Insistió en que su país tomaría ‘medidas decisivas’ para garantizar su soberanía y dejar claro que no tolerará provocaciones.

Elon Musk activó el servicio satelital para ayudar a los ciudadanos, permitiendo comunicaciones vía redes sociales y acceso a noticias independientes. Sin embargo, las autoridades iraníes respondieron desplegando tecnología de interferencia avanzada, conocida como 'kill switch', que logró interrumpir las señales satelitales por primera vez desde que Starlink opera clandestinamente en el país. Este suceso marca un punto de inflexión en la carrera tecnológica entre regímenes autoritarios y proveedores de internet satelital.

Torres destaca que, en sus inicios, la izquierda española mostró escepticismo hacia el chavismo, al considerarlo un movimiento militarista y populista, aunque con el tiempo cambió su postura y terminó apoyando el proceso, aunque con escasa autocrítica. El autor también subraya cómo desde dentro del movimiento se advirtieron signos de corrupción y autoritarismo que, en su opinión, terminaron deteriorando los ideales originales de la revolución.

En 2014, tras una década alejado de los escenarios, Bowie sorprendió con The Next Day, pero un diagnóstico de cáncer de hígado le hizo entender que su tiempo era limitado. A pesar del mal pronóstico, el músico inglés trabajó en su último disco, que lanzó el 8 de enero de 2016, coincidiendo con su cumpleaños número 69, y falleció solo dos días después. Blackstar se considera un reflejo perfecto de su carrera: un trabajo complejo, hermoso e inesperado que fusiona jazz, rock y reflexiones vitales sobre la muerte y la despedida. Pocas veces un artista ha creado un álbum sabiendo que sería su testamento sonoro, como hicieron Bowie y Leonard Cohen en sus últimos meses.

Entre los mamíferos destacan el visón europeo, del que apenas quedan unos 142 ejemplares concentrados principalmente en Navarra, y el desmán ibérico, reducido a cinco núcleos poblacionales que sufren la degradación de los ríos y la contaminación. En cuanto a las aves, la focha moruna, el alcaudón chico, la cerceta pardilla y el urogallo cantábrico presentan una regresión preocupante por la pérdida de humedales, la agricultura intensiva, el uso de pesticidas y los incendios.

Fuentes diplomáticas señalaron que los generales consideraban la idea temeraria e intentaron desviar la atención de Trump hacia otras operaciones menos polémicas, como la vigilancia de buques rusos que eluden sanciones o eventuales acciones contra Irán.

Antes de la llegada masiva de los CD-ROM, muchos usuarios tuvieron que instalarlo mediante nada menos que 28 disquetes de 3,5 pulgadas, cada uno con una capacidad de apenas 1,44 MB. En total, el sistema ocupaba unos 40 MB, una cifra considerable para la época. El proceso de instalación era largo y tedioso: había que insertar y cambiar los disquetes uno tras otro, siguiendo las instrucciones en pantalla con cuidado. Si un solo disquete estaba dañado, toda la instalación podía quedar interrumpida, lo que obligaba a empezar desde el principio. La paciencia era una virtud imprescindible para cualquier usuario doméstico de mediados de los noventa. Con el tiempo, la versión en CD-ROM simplificó enormemente el proceso y se convirtió en la opción preferida por la mayoría, aunque aquellos ordenadores sin lector de CD siguieron dependiendo de los disquetes.

Según relató, los agentes lo esposaron y lo metieron en la parte trasera de un todoterreno antes de dejarlo libre, supuestamente al decirle que 'como era blanco, no sería divertido'. Callaghan explicó que se unió a la manifestación cuando se enteró de la muerte de la mujer, identificada como Renee Nicole Good, e intentó interceder cuando vio que los agentes rodeaban a una joven latina. Durante el enfrentamiento, uno de los oficiales le apuntó con un arma y le preguntó si tenía miedo, a lo que él respondió que no.

Aunque la medida pretende combatir la pornografía infantil en internet, la propuesta plantea que las plataformas de mensajería escaneen voluntariamente las comunicaciones privadas de los usuarios para detectar contenido ilegal. Este enfoque, conocido como 'Chat Control', permitiría la instalación de un software en los dispositivos de los usuarios para analizar los mensajes antes de que sean cifrados, lo que, según múltiples expertos, supone una grave amenaza a la privacidad y a los derechos fundamentales.

En el artículo se destaca una de sus ideas clave: las convicciones más arraigadas, aquellas que menos nos hacen dudar, son precisamente las más sospechosas. Según Ortega, estas creencias profundas no surgen de un razonamiento crítico, sino que forman parte del sustrato de nuestra vida cotidiana, de lo que damos por sentado sin cuestionar. Distingue entre 'ideas', que son pensamientos elaborados y discutibles, y 'creencias', que son el fundamento mismo de nuestra existencia, tan radicadas que las confundimos con la realidad misma. El filósofo argumenta que la verdadera vitalidad intelectual radica en la duda, en cuestionar esas bases inamovibles para evitar el dogmatismo. Ortega ilustra esto con ejemplos cotidianos: creemos en la solidez del suelo bajo nuestros pies o en la permanencia de nuestro entorno sin pensarlo, pero es pre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reflexion-de-ortega-y-gasset-sobre-las-convicciones-y-la-duda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reflexion-de-ortega-y-gasset-sobre-las-convicciones-y-la-duda</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los Mercedes W123, vehículos esenciales en los campamentos saharauis de Tinduf]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hace cincuenta años, en 1975, Marruecos inició la ocupación del Sáhara Occidental, lo que provocó el éxodo masivo de la población saharaui hacia la hamada de Tinduf, una región desértica e inhóspita en Argelia. Ese mismo año, Mercedes-Benz comenzó la producción del modelo W123, un vehículo diésel robusto que se lanzó oficialmente en enero de 1976 y que hoy sigue siendo indispensable para más de 170.000 refugiados distribuidos en cinco wilayas o distritos administrativos: El Aaiún, Auserd, Smara, Bojador y Dajla. Estos campamentos, organizados como ciudades de adobe por la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática (RASD), dependen de una flota masiva de estos coches antiguos, adquiridos por unos 3.000 euros cada uno, principalmente importados de Europa por su fiabilidad en condiciones extremas.

Hace años, la publicidad online se entendía como un intercambio justo: los usuarios veían anuncios a cambio de acceder gratuitamente al contenido. Sin embargo, el autor expone que esta lógica se ha degradado hasta convertirse en una estrategia deliberada para empeorar la experiencia gratuita. YouTube, según Lacort, muestra anuncios más largos, frecuentes e invasivos que interrumpen vídeos y canciones en los momentos más inoportunos, buscando que el usuario se sienta frustrado y opte por pagar la versión sin anuncios. El texto sostiene que la plataforma no persigue solo ingresos publicitarios, sino crear una sensación de saturación para empujar al usuario hacia la suscripción. Además, compara este enfoque con otros servicios digitales —como Netflix, Disney+ o Spotify— que también recortan o distorsionan opciones e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/youtube-ha-transformado-la-publicidad-en-una-herramienta-para-forzar-suscripciones-a-premium</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/youtube-ha-transformado-la-publicidad-en-una-herramienta-para-forzar-suscripciones-a-premium</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 16:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Fundación Contexto y Acción celebra en Zaragoza las primeras Jornadas Internacionales sobre la lucha contra el odio y la desinformación]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fundación Contexto y Acción, junto con la Universidad de Zaragoza, organizará los días 22 y 23 de enero de 2026 las I Jornadas Internacionales “Ideas para combatir el odio”.

Rivero sostiene que la fuerza no otorga razón ni legitimidad, sino un poder vacío e inhumano, y que el Derecho Internacional fue creado no para proteger a los 'buenos', sino para limitar a los poderosos y garantizar la convivencia entre naciones mediante el diálogo y la cooperación. El autor critica con dureza la actuación de Estados Unidos –en particular bajo el liderazgo de Donald Trump– por su política intervencionista, recordando conflictos pasados como Corea, Vietnam, Afganistán, Libia o Irak, que dejaron tras de sí destrucción, pobreza y divisiones internas.

El texto presenta esta reedición como un ejercicio de justicia histórica hacia una de las series más queridas del cómic español de los años 80, que destacó por su humor costumbrista, cercano y entrañable. El volumen se abre con 'El héroe del cómic', una historia larga en la que Benito, cansado de su vida mediocre, decide convertirse en héroe, pasando por parodias de géneros como el western, la ciencia ficción o el espionaje. A través de estas transformaciones, los autores evidencian su amor por el medio y su capacidad para combinar sátira y ternura. Posteriormente, el tomo recopila historietas breves publicadas entre 1982 y 1985, protagonizadas por el joven Benito en situaciones cotidianas —exá]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/benito-boniato-y-los-hermanos-fresno-la-reivindicacion-del-humor-clasico-en-el-comic-espanol</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/benito-boniato-y-los-hermanos-fresno-la-reivindicacion-del-humor-clasico-en-el-comic-espanol</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La lucha contra el frío en los monasterios medievales: estrategias y vida cotidiana de los monjes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante la Edad Media, los monasterios se enfrentaban a duros inviernos que ponían a prueba la resistencia y la disciplina de los monjes. Aunque las reglas monásticas, especialmente la Regla de San Benito, promovían la austeridad y la renuncia a los placeres materiales, la realidad del clima obligó a los religiosos a buscar formas prácticas de combatir el frío. San Benito, escribiendo en la Italia del siglo VI, reconocía que en regiones más frías los monjes necesitarían ropa adicional, aunque en la práctica solo se permitía una cogulla más gruesa en invierno. En el norte de Europa, donde las temperaturas eran mucho más bajas, la vida en los monasterios se volvía especialmente dura. Las iglesias y dormitorios no tenían calefacción y solo existía un espacio con fuego: el calefactorio o sala de calentamiento. Este lugar, normalmente junto al refectorio, era el único donde los monjes podían reunirse alrededor del fuego para recuperar algo de calor.

En su mensaje, el Mossad expresó su apoyo directo a los manifestantes, afirmando que 'no solo están con ellos desde la distancia, sino también sobre el terreno'. Este gesto representa un raro reconocimiento público de actividades dentro de Irán, en un contexto de creciente tensión en la región. Desde mediados de diciembre, Irán ha sufrido un aumento del malestar social motivado por la caída del valor del rial, el encarecimiento de los combustibles y la escasez de agua. Las protestas se han extendido por todo el país, reflejando el descontento general de la población ante la crisis económica.

Según el autor, medios como el New York Journal, de William Randolph Hearst, y el New York World, de Joseph Pulitzer, promovieron un periodismo sensacionalista que exageraba o inventaba hechos para despertar emociones y vender más ejemplares, iniciando así la era del “periodismo amarillo”. Ejemplos destacados incluyen el 'caso Olivette', donde se inventó un registro humillante de una joven cubana por funcionarios españoles; la manipulación del rescate de Evangelina Cossío, presentado como una epopeya heroica; y la tergiversación de la explosión del acorazado USS Maine, atribuida falsamente a las fuerzas españolas, lo que desató un fervor bélico con el lema “Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!”.

Por ejemplo, el NAD 3020 es citado como un clásico de los años 80 por su sonido cálido y equilibrado; el Marantz PM7200 destaca por su capacidad de trabajar en clase A o AB; y el Cyrus One es elogiado por su musicalidad y su excelente sección de fono.

En su intervención, Trump afirmó que China no utiliza energía procedente del viento y que las turbinas que fabrica se destinan únicamente a su exportación hacia países como Estados Unidos y las naciones europeas, a las que calificó de “pardillos”. Sin embargo, los datos oficiales desmienten categóricamente esta declaración: China no solo produce la mayoría de los componentes de los aerogeneradores, sino que también lidera el uso global de esta fuente de energía renovable. Según cifras de 2025, el país contaba con una capacidad operativa de unos 444.000 megavatios, lo que equivale a aproximadamente el 44% del total mundial, casi el triple que Estados Unidos.

Según el informe, niños y adolescentes, algunos de tan solo 12 años, son enviados desde asentamientos ilegales para hostigar a familias beduinas y aldeas palestinas mediante actos de vandalismo, intimidación y violencia.

El suceso, grabado por testigos y filtrado en redes sociales, ha provocado una fuerte reacción pública y política, especialmente por la respuesta del gobierno de Donald Trump y la ministra del Interior, Kristi Noem, que calificaron a la víctima como una 'terrorista doméstica' sin pruebas. Las autoridades locales, incluido el gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz, y el alcalde de Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, condenaron duramente el hecho, denunciando los abusos sistemáticos del ICE y la política federal de represión contra estados y ciudades progresistas.

Las manifestaciones, impulsadas por el hartazgo ante la represión, la crisis económica y las condiciones de vida precarias, han ganado visibilidad en redes sociales gracias a imágenes impactantes de mujeres que encienden cigarrillos utilizando fotos del líder supremo, Ali Jamenei, puestas en llamas. Esta acción simbólica se ha viralizado como un gesto de desafío directo al régimen. Para contrarrestar la difusión de estas imágenes y evitar la coordinación de las revueltas, el gobierno ha impuesto un apagón total de internet y bloqueo de comunicaciones, similar a tácticas usadas en protestas anteriores. Las fuerzas de seguridad no han logrado contener las protestas, que incluyen asaltos a vehículos policiales, comisarías y edificios gubernamentales, causando extensos daños.

En su análisis, explica que la infancia atraviesa un profundo sufrimiento psíquico derivado de la presencia masiva de las pantallas y de la ausencia emocional de los adultos. Según Knobel Freud, la introducción temprana del teléfono móvil —entre los 9 y 11 años— supone un error que sustituye el papel del padre o la madre por el del dispositivo, que pasa a dictar las normas y a ofrecer una falsa sensación de control. El resultado es una generación con menos creatividad, menos juego y mayor soledad. Afirma que las redes sociales fomentan una socialización ilusoria que incrementa el aislamiento y reduce la capacidad de confrontar ideas o emociones reales.

Este movimiento marca un paso significativo para la industria tecnológica, ya que por primera vez un gran fabricante estadounidense opta por proveedores chinos en un segmento tradicionalmente dominado por Samsung, SK Hynix y Micron. CXMT, que ha desarrollado memorias DDR5 y LPDDR5X de alto rendimiento con velocidades de hasta 8.000 y 10.667 MT/s respectivamente, se perfila como una alternativa sólida gracias a su creciente capacidad de producción, estimada en unas 300.000 obleas mensuales.

Según Carlson, esta evolución se caracteriza por la concentración del poder en el Ejecutivo y la pérdida de relevancia del Congreso, cuyo papel considera cada vez más simbólico e ignorado en la toma de decisiones. Argumentó que estas acciones reflejan una política exterior más directa y sin disimulos, en la que Washington ya no oculta sus motivaciones geopolíticas y económicas. En este sentido, señaló que el verdadero motivo de la ofensiva no es la lucha contra el narcotráfico, sino el interés por hacerse con los recursos petroleros venezolanos, especialmente ante la competencia de China.

La nave Crew Dragon Endeavour llevará de vuelta a Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui y Oleg Platónov, dejando a la tripulación rusa-estadounidense de la Soyuz MS-28 a bordo. Aunque nunca antes una misión de la ISS había finalizado antes por razones médicas, existen precedentes en la era soviética. 

El primero ocurrió en 1976 con la Soyuz 21, cuando el cosmonauta Vitali Zhólobov sufrió un grave deterioro psicológico tras una serie de fallos eléctricos en la estación militar Salyut 5. A pesar de los esfuerzos por continuar la misión, los médicos decidieron evacuar a la tripulación anticipadamente. Un segundo caso tuvo lugar en 1985 con la Soyuz T-14: Vladímir Vasyutin enfermó de la próstata mientras servía en la Salyut 7, lo que obligó a adelantar el regreso.

Este sistema combina las propiedades de un superfluido (flujo sin fricción) con un orden cristalino, es decir, una modulación periódica en la densidad que rompe la simetría de traslación espacial. El experimento parte de un condensado de Bose–Einstein de polaritones en una guía de ondas fabricada con una aleación de AlGaAs, estructurada con una rejilla sublongitud de onda que permite manipular los modos de propagación de la luz acoplada a excitones. Mediante la excitación del sistema con un láser ultrarrápido a 770 nm y el enfriamiento a unos 4 K, se genera el condensado polaritónico fundamental (modo |0⟩). Al aumentar la potencia del láser, se produce una oscilación paramétrica óptica isoenergética, que dispersa polaritones hacia dos modos simétricos (|±1⟩), generando un patrón de interferencia estable —una huella ex]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/observacion-experimental-de-un-supersolido-de-polaritones-en-un-cristal-fotonico-semiconductor</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/observacion-experimental-de-un-supersolido-de-polaritones-en-un-cristal-fotonico-semiconductor</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El juez Antonio Piña inicia diligencias previas para determinar si se investiga a Zapatero por su relación con el Gobierno de Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El magistrado Antonio Piña, de la Audiencia Nacional, ha ordenado la apertura de diligencias previas contra José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero tras una querella interpuesta por la asociación Hazte Oír.

En un comunicado conjunto, las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) y el servicio de inteligencia Shin Bet explicaron que los ataques se dirigieron contra “terroristas e infraestructuras terroristas” pertenecientes a Hamas, afectando enclaves en el norte y el sur de la Franja.

Esta decisión se produce mientras el nuevo gobierno estadounidense intensifica su retórica sobre la posibilidad de controlar Groenlandia, incluso a través de una intervención militar. El yacimiento de Kvanefjeld alberga una de las mayores reservas mundiales de tierras raras, uranio y torio. En 2021, el partido inuit Ataqatigiit prohibió su explotación por motivos medioambientales, una medida que ETM considera una expropiación y que ha impugnado ante tribunales internacionales, reclamando más de 11.000 millones de dólares, cifra que multiplica por cuatro el PIB de Groenlandia.

Varoufakis señaló que estos deepfakes no solo imitan su aspecto físico y su tono de voz, sino que además le atribuyen opiniones y frases que jamás ha dicho, generando confusión entre el público y afectando a su reputación personal y profesional. Este fenómeno refleja un problema cada vez más grave vinculado al uso de la inteligencia artificial en la generación de contenidos falsos, que se propagan con gran rapidez en Internet.

El bombardeo, parte de una operación dirigida por el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, dejó alrededor de un centenar de muertos, entre civiles y militares, según las autoridades venezolanas. El Bloque 12, habitado principalmente por personas mayores, quedó prácticamente destruido y se convirtió en símbolo del sufrimiento civil en una ofensiva centrada principalmente en objetivos militares. 
Wilman González, electricista de 54 años, sobrevivió al impacto pero perdió a su tía Rosa, de 79 años, que murió tras quedar atrapada entre los escombros.

Según informó la fiscalía del condado de Delaware, el acusado sustraía restos humanos de mausoleos y bóvedas selladas que databan de hace varios siglos. En su vivienda y en una nave de su propiedad, la policía encontró cráneos, huesos, manos y pies momificados, así como torsos parcialmente descompuestos. Algunos de estos restos habían sido colocados o colgados en diferentes estados de conservación, lo que sugiere una manipulación deliberada de los cadáveres. 

Gerlach fue arrestado cuando regresaba a su coche portando una palanca y una bolsa que contenía restos momificados de dos niños pequeños junto con tres cráneos y varios huesos.

Martínez sostiene que este episodio no solo representa una nueva aplicación de la Doctrina Monroe, sino también una redefinición del poder imperial de Estados Unidos en América Latina. Según el análisis, el golpe habría contado con la colaboración de sectores del chavismo, en especial del entorno de Delcy y Jorge Rodríguez, que habrían aceptado un acuerdo tácito con Washington para garantizar su permanencia parcial en el poder, dando lugar a lo que el autor califica como una situación de 'una y media dictaduras' en el país.

Esta acumulación de calor oceánico (OHC) confirma la tendencia sostenida al calentamiento global y convierte a los océanos en el mayor reservorio térmico de la Tierra, ya que absorben más del 90 % del exceso de calor causado por los gases de efecto invernadero. Los datos proceden de instituciones de Asia, Europa y América, como el Instituto de Física Atmosférica de la Academia China de Ciencias, Copernicus Marine y la NOAA/NCEI.

Quien se mete con Chávez se mete con Venezuela”. Este comentario contrasta fuertemente con la postura actual de Ayuso, férrea crítica del Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y defensora de la oposición venezolana. 

El contexto del tuit se remonta a un momento en que Estados Unidos investigaba a altos funcionarios venezolanos, como Diosdado Cabello, por presunto narcotráfico y lavado de dinero.

Los hechos ocurrieron el jueves por la tarde, cuando el agresor consiguió acceder al edificio y dirigirse al piso donde residían ambas mujeres. Según las cámaras de seguridad, el hombre subió hasta la vivienda y poco después los vecinos oyeron los gritos desesperados de las víctimas, lo que motivó la intervención policial. Cuando los agentes derribaron la puerta, hallaron a las dos mujeres en el suelo con graves heridas en la cabeza y la cara, provocadas con una olla.

La iniciativa aspira a superar el récord de la discoteca Privilege de Ibiza, considerada la más grande del mundo según el Guinness World Records, pero ha generado una fuerte polémica entre organizaciones ecologistas, colectivos vecinales y ciudadanos. Estas entidades advierten de graves deficiencias en la planificación y consideran que el entorno natural de la Sierra de Ayllón no es adecuado para acoger eventos de tal magnitud. En sus alegaciones, denuncian la falta de un plan de evacuación claro, una evaluación ambiental detallada, y una previsión insuficiente de aparcamientos —solo se estiman entre 3.000 y 6.000 vehículos—, lo que podría generar caos circulatorio, ocupación irregular de terrenos y riesgos para la seguridad.

Este descenso marca un fuerte contraste con el 11 % obtenido en 2023, cuando el canal vivió una etapa de mayor estabilidad antes de los recientes cambios en su dirección y gestión política. La caída coincide con la aprobación de una nueva ley de medios impulsada únicamente por el Partido Popular gallego, que permite al Gobierno autonómico controlar directamente la elección de la dirección de la cadena sin necesidad de una mayoría cualificada, elimina los mecanismos de fiscalización profesional y facilita el uso del castellano en los contenidos.

Kevin Terwilliger, jefe de producto de la compañía, explicó que mencionar la IA genera más confusión que claridad sobre los beneficios reales, como el procesamiento local mediante NPUs dedicadas. Por ello, Dell ha optado por un enfoque más tradicional en su presentación, destacando rendimiento, autonomía, diseños y formatos en lugar de promocionar la IA como gancho principal. La IA se presenta ahora como una capacidad integrada de serie, explicando qué hace realmente el equipo por el usuario, sin etiquetas vacías. Terwilliger apuntó a una 'promesa incumplida' en torno a la IA, que no impulsa las ventas, agravada por la escasez de memoria en 2026. En el mercado de consumo, la mayoría usa servicios en la nube como ChatGPT o Grok, que no requieren hardware especializado.

Anexionado en 1898, el archipiélago ocupó un lugar complejo dentro de la historia norteamericana, marcado por tensiones entre identidad local y política imperial. Durante la primera mitad del siglo XX, los habitantes de Hawái solicitaron repetidamente la condición de estado, con la esperanza de elegir su propio gobernador y participar de forma directa en las decisiones federales. La Segunda Guerra Mundial fortaleció su causa, cuando ciudadanos de distintos orígenes étnicos mostraron su lealtad mediante el servicio militar y el esfuerzo civil. Sin embargo, Washington retrasó la decisión debido a prejuicios sobre la distancia y la supuesta diferencia cultural del territorio respecto al continente.

Mientras el Gobierno de Emmanuel Macron mantenía silencio, la líder del Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN), Marine Le Pen, criticó duramente la acción de Washington y apeló al respeto de la soberanía nacional. Le Pen reivindicó la doctrina gaullista, recordando que Francia debe ser aliada de Estados Unidos, pero siempre preservando su independencia en materia de política exterior. Esta postura fue reforzada por su mano derecha, Louis Aliot, quien consideró inaceptable que un jefe de Estado sea detenido por un comando extranjero, incluso si se trata de un líder como Maduro, con quien el RN no comparte afinidades ideológicas.

La reacción del RN contrasta con la prudencia del presidente Macron y refleja una tendencia creciente en la extrema derecha francesa: un distanciamiento estratégico de la órbita de Donald Trump.

La grabación, obtenida por el medio Alpha News y analizada por The Advocate, muestra que Ross no se encontraba en inminente peligro cuando abrió fuego contra el vehículo de Good. En las imágenes se observa a la mujer comportándose de forma tranquila y conciliadora durante la interacción, mientras su esposa, Becca Good, grababa la escena.

El plan, de carácter temporal, se extenderá hasta el 12 de febrero.
El anuncio se realizó a través de un correo electrónico interno a los profesores, al que tuvo acceso Associated Press. El contexto de esta decisión se enmarca en la llegada de unos 2.000 agentes federales enviados por el Gobierno del presidente Donald Trump y por las tensiones provocadas tras la muerte de una mujer abatida por un agente migratorio en la misma semana.

Gupta explicó que repetir con tanta frecuencia el test cognitivo MoCA suele ser una señal de que los médicos están vigilando un posible deterioro cognitivo o demencia temprana, y no simplemente realizando exámenes rutinarios. Otros especialistas, como el psicólogo John Gartner, coinciden en que la repetición del test sugiere seguimiento de una enfermedad más que prevención.

Su tesis central es que la narrativa de una Venezuela próspera antes del chavismo no se corresponde con los datos históricos. Durante las décadas de 1980 y 1990, el país experimentó una profunda crisis económica, elevados niveles de pobreza y una marcada desigualdad social. Según cifras del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo y el Banco Mundial, más de dos tercios de la población vivía bajo el umbral de pobreza en 1999, y el coeficiente de Gini alcanzaba valores cercanos a 0,5, reflejando una fuerte concentración de riqueza en manos de una élite minoritaria.

Bosch señaló que utilizar términos como 'captura' o 'detención' para describir un hecho que, según él, constituye un secuestro, supone otorgar legitimidad jurídica a una acción que no la tiene. Para el jurista, llamar 'detención' a lo que en realidad es la privación forzosa de libertad en el domicilio de una persona es una manipulación del lenguaje que suaviza y encubre la ilegalidad del acto.

Desde Moncloa, señalan que el líder socialista mantiene una postura coherente en defensa del Derecho Internacional, una línea que comparten con el ministro de Exteriores, José Manuel Albares. El Gobierno español ha impulsado declaraciones conjuntas con países de la Unión Europea —exceptuando a Hungría— y con Gobiernos latinoamericanos progresistas como los de Chile, Brasil, Colombia, Uruguay y México. En ellas, España ha exigido una respuesta firme frente a la actuación del expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump y su intervención en Caracas.

En publicaciones difundidas en redes sociales, el medio calificó a la víctima como 'zurda enferma mental' y 'desquiciada', afirmando que fue correctamente abatida 'en defensa propia'. Estas expresiones han generado una amplia condena pública por su tono despectivo hacia una persona fallecida y por la desinformación en torno a las circunstancias del suceso. 

Según fuentes citadas por la cadena CBS, Good murió cuando su vehículo trató de bloquear una calle durante un control migratorio. En los vídeos difundidos se observa cómo agentes intentan abrir la puerta del coche antes de que la conductora acelere, momento en el que uno de los agentes dispara repetidamente.

Los investigadores grabaron los primeros 100 segundos tras la llegada a casa de 31 cuidadores para analizar el comportamiento de saludo de los gatos. Aunque el tamaño de la muestra fue reducido, el hallazgo principal indica que los gatos emiten más vocalizaciones —maullidos y otros sonidos— cuando la persona que regresa a casa es un hombre. En concreto, los felinos realizaron una media de 4,3 vocalizaciones en saludos a cuidadores varones, frente a 1,8 cuando se trataba de mujeres. 

Según los investigadores, esta diferencia podría deberse a las variaciones en el estilo comunicativo entre hombres y mujeres. Estudios anteriores ya habían mostrado que las mujeres tienden a hablar más con sus gatos y responden más a sus maullidos, lo que podría fomentar una comunicación más flu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudio-revela-que-los-gatos-vocalizan-mas-con-cuidadores-hombres-que-con-mujeres</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-estudio-revela-que-los-gatos-vocalizan-mas-con-cuidadores-hombres-que-con-mujeres</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 01:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guardia civil condenada a indemnizar a un compañero tras agredirlo por error durante un operativo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En octubre de 2018, durante las fiestas de Boadilla del Monte, una agente de la Guardia Civil agredió por error a un compañero que iba de paisano. La agente formaba parte del dispositivo de seguridad y, al recibir aviso de posibles hurtos de móviles, persiguió a un grupo de jóvenes. Al acercarse a uno de ellos, utilizó su defensa extensible golpeando por la espalda y en la cara a la víctima, creyendo que era un ladrón. Al instante se descubrió que se trataba de un compañero del operativo. Tras un juicio en la Audiencia Provincial de Madrid y recursos posteriores, el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid confirmó la condena por un delito de lesiones, imponiendo una multa de 1.450 euros y la obligación de indemnizar con más de 18.000 euros al agente agredido.

A su juicio, los principales consumidores siguen siendo Estados Unidos, Europa Occidental y Brasil, y la ruta dominante de tráfico pasa por México y el océano Pacífico, que hoy canalizan el 70 % del flujo hacia Norteamérica.

Según Reich, el propósito ético de toda sociedad civilizada es impedir que los poderosos ataquen y exploten a los más débiles. Este principio, que inspiró los documentos fundacionales de Estados Unidos y el orden internacional posterior a la Segunda Guerra Mundial, se ve cada vez más erosionado por la concentración del poder económico y político.
Reich conecta los recientes acontecimientos –como la incursión de Trump en Venezuela, sus amenazas hacia Cuba, Colombia y Groenlandia, y su intento de golpe de Estado hace cinco años– con una tendencia global en la que líderes autoritarios y grandes corporaciones actúan sin rendir cuentas.

El informe también indica que Gaetz consumió drogas ilegales, como cocaína y éxtasis, entre 2017 y 2019, y aceptó regalos no permitidos, incluyendo un viaje a las Bahamas. El documento, de 42 páginas, concluye que el comportamiento de Gaetz fue deshonroso y violó normas de conducta del Congreso y leyes estatales y federales.

El informe detalla que Gaetz pagó decenas de miles de dólares a mujeres, en parte vinculados a actividades sexuales o consumo de drogas.

Estos indultos se producen en un contexto de tensión política persistente en EE.UU., donde las disputas sobre la legitimidad de las elecciones de 2020 continúan siendo un tema divisivo.

París teme que el enfoque europeo incremente los costes para los consumidores franceses y limite su soberanía energética. Según el operador RTE, las infraestructuras de interconexión se financian mediante tarifas que suponen aproximadamente una cuarta parte del recibo eléctrico en Francia. La Comisión Europea propone destinar un 25% de los ingresos por congestión (beneficios generados cuando las líneas eléctricas están saturadas) a financiar nuevos proyectos europeos, lo que reduciría el alivio económico para los usuarios franceses.

Según las autoridades del ICE, el agente actuó en defensa propia cuando Good presuntamente trató de huir con su vehículo y amenazó su seguridad. Sin embargo, las autoridades locales, incluido el alcalde de Mineápolis, Jacob Frey, rechazan esta versión y califican el tiroteo como una acción injustificada.

Su trabajo revela que, al tatuarse la piel, parte de la tinta no se queda únicamente en el lugar del tatuaje, sino que viaja a través del sistema linfático y se acumula en los ganglios linfáticos. Allí, las células defensivas, como los macrófagos, intentan eliminarla sin éxito, lo que provoca una inflamación que puede volverse crónica. Según González, esta inflamación persistente podría estar relacionada con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar ciertos tipos de cáncer, como el melanoma o el linfoma.

La página presenta a los manifestantes que irrumpieron en el Capitolio como 'protestantes pacíficos' provocados por las fuerzas del orden y sostiene, sin pruebas, que la violencia fue instigada por la policía y por la entonces presidenta de la Cámara de Representantes, Nancy Pelosi. Además, ofrece una cronología selectiva de los acontecimientos que omite partes clave del discurso de Trump y los episodios de violencia registrados ese día. El sitio también acusa al exvicepresidente Mike Pence de 'cobardía' por no rechazar la certificación de la victoria de Joe Biden, y retrata a Trump como un héroe que corrigió una 'injusticia histórica' al indultar a unas 1.600 personas implicadas en el asalto, incluidos miembros de grupos extremistas.

Maestre parte de un caso mediático —un refugiado venezolano que, en televisión, celebró la supuesta detención de Nicolás Maduro y apeló a una posible acción similar en España— para desarrollar una crítica sobre la influencia ideológica de ciertos exiliados venezolanos en el panorama político español. El autor sostiene que parte de este colectivo, beneficiado por políticas de asilo del Gobierno socialista, ha articulado una red de apoyo y financiación a la extrema derecha española. Según Maestre, estos grupos comparten rasgos con la diáspora cubana en Miami y estarían contribuyendo a la radicalización política en Madrid y otras zonas del país. Asimismo, apunta que su poder económico y mediático, con plataformas como 'The Objective' y el llamado 'Little Caracas', refuerza la difusión de ideas reaccionarias y afecta cuestion]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-influencia-politica-de-ciertos-grupos-venezolanos-en-la-derecha-espanola</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-influencia-politica-de-ciertos-grupos-venezolanos-en-la-derecha-espanola</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 02:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[20 años de recursos judiciales ultracatólicos que retrasan derechos de aborto y eutanasia en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante los últimos 20 años, distintos colectivos ultracatólicos en España han utilizado los tribunales para frenar la ampliación de derechos relacionados con el aborto y la eutanasia. En el caso del aborto, la asociación E-Cristians llevó a juicio al doctor Morín y a personal de clínicas privadas, aunque finalmente la mayoría de las causas fueron archivadas o concluyeron con penas mínimas. Estas acciones judiciales provocaron un debate prolongado que derivó en la reforma legal de 2010, que permitió el aborto libre hasta la semana 14 de gestación, superando la anterior ley de 1985, más restrictiva. Actualmente, la organización Abogados Cristianos mantiene una estrategia similar respecto a la eutanasia, interponiendo recursos y querellas que retrasan la aplicación de este derecho a pacientes con enfermedades graves y sufrimiento intenso. En Barcelona, la joven N. y otro paciente llevan más de un año esperando la resolución judicial para poder acceder a la eutanasia, mientras que un juzg]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/20-anos-de-recursos-judiciales-ultracatolicos-que-retrasan-derechos-de-aborto-y-eutanasia-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/20-anos-de-recursos-judiciales-ultracatolicos-que-retrasan-derechos-de-aborto-y-eutanasia-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 01:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rusia denuncia la interceptación de un petrolero ruso por la Guardia Costera de EE.UU. en aguas internacionales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Transportes de Rusia ha denunciado la interceptación del petrolero 'Marinera', que navegaba bajo bandera rusa, por parte de la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos en aguas internacionales. El incidente se produjo fuera de los límites de las aguas territoriales de cualquier país y provocó la pérdida de comunicación con el buque. Rusia calificó esta acción como ilegal, argumentando que contraviene la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre el Derecho del Mar de 1982, que establece la libertad de navegación en aguas internacionales y prohíbe el uso de la fuerza contra buques registrados bajo la jurisdicción de otros Estados. El Gobierno ruso ha emitido un comunicado oficial a través de Telegram subrayando que ningún Estado puede emplear la fuerza contra barcos de otras jurisdicciones. Este hecho se produce en un contexto de tensiones geopolíticas entre Rusia y Estados Unidos, y aumenta la preocupación internacional sobre la seguridad de la navegación marítima y la aplicación de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-denuncia-la-interceptacion-de-un-petrolero-ruso-por-la-guardia-costera-de-ee-uu-en-aguas-internacionales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-denuncia-la-interceptacion-de-un-petrolero-ruso-por-la-guardia-costera-de-ee-uu-en-aguas-internacionales</guid><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon impulsa en España un sistema de reparto a domicilio a través de pequeños comercios locales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Amazon está poniendo en marcha en España un nuevo modelo de reparto que busca apoyarse en pequeños comercios y establecimientos de barrio para la entrega final de los paquetes al cliente, reduciendo de forma muy notable el papel de sus repartidores y furgonetas propias. La compañía, a través de una empresa especializada subcontratada, está contactando con varios miles de negocios ya establecidos para que se conviertan en «comercios colaboradores» y asuman parte de la logística de última milla en sus propias zonas. La captación de estos comercios se organiza por códigos postales, de manera que cada establecimiento se haga cargo de una media de 30 paquetes diarios, de lunes a sábado, todos ellos en su propio barrio o en calles cercanas.

Este esquema implica que las furgonetas de Amazon se centrarán en llevar lotes de paquetes a los comercios colaboradores, en lugar de realizar entregas individuales puerta a puerta, lo que reduciría drásticamente el número de vehículos y repartidores nec]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-impulsa-en-espana-un-sistema-de-reparto-a-domicilio-a-traves-de-pequenos-comercios-locales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-impulsa-en-espana-un-sistema-de-reparto-a-domicilio-a-traves-de-pequenos-comercios-locales</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Críticas del PP a la ausencia de Sánchez en la Pascua Militar pese a su asistencia a una cumbre internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda la polémica generada tras las declaraciones de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, líder del Partido Popular, al criticar que el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, no acudiera al tradicional desfile de la Pascua Militar celebrado el 6 de enero. Feijóo reprochó esta ausencia pese a que Sánchez se encontraba participando en una cumbre internacional de alto nivel, en un contexto geopolítico especialmente sensible y con la presencia de líderes internacionales como Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, Volodímir Zelenski o Mark Rutte.

El artículo, publicado en la sección Tremending de Público, adopta un tono claramente irónico y crítico con la postura del PP, subrayando lo que considera una contradicción política y una falta de visión internacional por parte de la derecha española. Se señala que la crítica de Feijóo se ve amplificada por determinados medios afines, como La Razón, que llegaron a hablar de un 'plante a la Zarzuela', alimentando así una narrativa de confrontación institucio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-del-pp-a-la-ausencia-de-sanchez-en-la-pascua-militar-pese-a-su-asistencia-a-una-cumbre-internacional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-del-pp-a-la-ausencia-de-sanchez-en-la-pascua-militar-pese-a-su-asistencia-a-una-cumbre-internacional</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rusia envía un submarino para acompañar a un petrolero implicado en sanciones en el Atlántico Norte]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rusia ha desplegado un submarino y otros recursos navales para escoltar a un petrolero que estaba siendo seguido por la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos en el Atlántico Norte, elevando la tensión entre ambos países. El buque, inicialmente llamado Bella 1 y recientemente renombrado Marinera, está vinculado al transporte de petróleo sancionado de Venezuela. Según informes de The Wall Street Journal, Moscú tomó la decisión de involucrarse directamente para proteger al petrolero y disuadir un posible abordaje estadounidense. Durante la persecución, la tripulación cambió la bandera del barco a Rusia y su nombre, lo que genera un conflicto legal sobre su estatus bajo el derecho internacional. Estados Unidos argumenta que inicialmente el barco era “sin bandera”, lo que permitía su abordaje, mientras que el registro ruso actual lo protege bajo su pabellón. Este incidente se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de sanciones occidentales, evasión de transporte de crudo y disputas sobre la denomina]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-envia-un-submarino-para-acompanar-a-un-petrolero-implicado-en-sanciones-en-el-atlantico-norte</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-envia-un-submarino-para-acompanar-a-un-petrolero-implicado-en-sanciones-en-el-atlantico-norte</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez tras la reunión de la Coalición de Voluntarios por Ucrania]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo recoge la comparecencia de Pedro Sánchez tras una reunión internacional de países y actores que apoyan a Ucrania, en la que informa sobre los acuerdos alcanzados, la posición de España respecto al conflicto y el respaldo político, diplomático y posiblemente humanitario o militar al Gobierno ucraniano.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-tras-la-reunion-de-la-coalicion-de-voluntarios-por-ucrania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-tras-la-reunion-de-la-coalicion-de-voluntarios-por-ucrania</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 21:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
