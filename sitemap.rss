The robbery occurred overnight between Sunday and Monday, with six items taken from the museum's classical wing, which houses artefacts from the Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods. The stolen items were described as gold ingots, though their exact age and origin have not been specified. The museum, which remained untouched during Syria's civil war, is now closed for security reasons and is expected to reopen next week. Syrian authorities have not officially confirmed the burglary, but several employees and guards were detained and interrogated following the incident. Security forces have since restricted access to the exhibition halls, and no outward signs of the theft were visible when journalists visited the museum. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the protection of cultural heritage in post-conflict ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ancient-gold-ingots-stolen-from-syria-s-national-museum-in-damascus</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ancient-gold-ingots-stolen-from-syria-s-national-museum-in-damascus</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China Blames US for $13 Billion Bitcoin Heist in 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[China’s cybersecurity agency has accused the U.S. government of orchestrating the theft of approximately $13 billion worth of Bitcoin, linking the crime to a state-sponsored hacking operation. The heist, which occurred in December 2020, involved the theft of 127,272 Bitcoin from the LuBian mining pool, once one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operations. China claims that the movement of the stolen cryptocurrency, which was later linked to funds seized by U.S. authorities, suggests the involvement of a government-level hacking operation. The U.S. government recently confiscated the stolen Bitcoin as part of an investigation into money laundering involving Chen Zhi, a Cambodian businessman linked to the Prince Group. U.S. authorities allege that the stolen funds were used to fund illegal crypto mining operations. The Chinese government has become more vocal about accusing the U.S. of cyberattacks in recent months, citing other incidents including alleged attacks on Chinese compani]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-blames-us-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-in-2020</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-blames-us-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-in-2020</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump's White House Renovations: A Mar-a-Lago-Inspired Makeover]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is making significant changes to the White House, with many elements inspired by his luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. The Oval Office has been revamped with gold fixtures, including a gilded presidential seal and ivy motifs replaced with golden accents. Trump also transformed the Rose Garden, replacing it with a paved courtyard that echoes the outdoor spaces at Mar-a-Lago. Outside the White House, two 88-foot flagpoles were installed, similar to the ones at Mar-a-Lago. The most controversial modification, however, is the demolition of the historic East Wing to make way for a grand ballroom, which will rival Mar-a-Lago's ballroom in size and opulence. This ballroom, funded by major corporate donors like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, is expected to cost around $300 million. The alterations have sparked criticism from historians and the public, who are concerned about the historical preservation of the White House and the lack of oversight on the r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-white-house-renovations-a-mar-a-lago-inspired-makeover</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-white-house-renovations-a-mar-a-lago-inspired-makeover</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, granted clemency by Trump, sentenced to 27 months after new criminal charges]]></title><description><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, a convicted drug dealer who had his sentence commuted by former President Donald Trump in January 2021, has been sentenced to 27 months in prison after violating the terms of his supervised release. Braun, 42, was accused of multiple serious offenses, including sexually assaulting his children's nanny and physically abusing a 3-year-old child. His original drug trafficking sentence was commuted by Trump during his final hours in office. Braun's release was reportedly influenced by his family's connections to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. However, after his release, Braun's behavior escalated, leading to criminal charges. He was also accused of assaulting a nurse with a hospital IV pole and threatening a fellow congregant at a New York synagogue. Braun was detained in April 2025 after being accused of assaulting the toddler. Despite having a record as a high-ranking member of a drug smuggling operation, Braun's release was initially seen as a chance for rehabilitati]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-granted-clemency-by-trump-sentenced-to-27-months-after-new-criminal-charges</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-granted-clemency-by-trump-sentenced-to-27-months-after-new-criminal-charges</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Denies Using Home Depot Decor for Oval Office Gold Accents]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump recently defended the opulent gold accents in the Oval Office, which have been a topic of public discussion since he took office. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump enlisted a 'gold guy' to add custom gilded finishes, including carvings for the fireplace mantel and ornate molding. However, these golden designs closely resemble plastic polyurethane appliques made by Ekena Millwork, which are sold at Home Depot for around $58.07. During a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham, Trump was asked whether these golden motifs came from the hardware store, to which he firmly responded, 'No, this is not Home Depot stuff. This is not Home Depot.' The video, posted by Ingraham, was captioned claiming the gold accents were authentic. BuzzFeed had previously reached out to Ekena Millwork, the company that manufactures the decorative pieces, and they confirmed that they work with several design firms in Washington, D.C., and believe that the Oval Office's fi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-denies-using-home-depot-decor-for-oval-office-gold-accents</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-denies-using-home-depot-decor-for-oval-office-gold-accents</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Challenges Facing Spain's Railway Infrastructure Management and the Role of Adif]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses the complexities and issues surrounding the management of railway infrastructure in Spain, focusing on Adif (Administrador de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias), the body responsible for maintaining and overseeing the country's rail networks. The piece touches on historical perspectives, from the privatization of railways in the UK to Spain's own experiences with railway management. The author highlights the financial challenges faced by Adif, including a massive debt burden and the tension between high-speed rail and conventional networks. The article critiques the impact of privatization and the competition in high-speed rail services, noting that three companies currently operate in Spain, but all are struggling financially. Moreover, it examines the ongoing issue of railway gauge compatibility, a lingering problem since the adoption of the Iberian gauge.

This deal allows Israel to maintain 'freedom of action' against threats when other parties are unwilling or unable to contain them. Herzog's statement sheds light on why the US has been largely silent regarding Israeli airstrikes and commando raids on Lebanese sites suspected of being linked to Hezbollah. These attacks, which have resulted in the deaths of at least 100 Lebanese civilians, contradict the 'final cessation of hostilities' that President Biden promised after the ceasefire. While reports about a memorandum of understanding allowing Israel to defend itself in Lebanon have circulated, Herzog's comments confirm this secret arrangement and clarify that Israel considers it a carte blanche to continue its military actions.

Israeli General Eyal Zamir has offered them a stark choice: surrender or be eliminated. The incident has moved beyond a purely military issue and entered the political arena, with former President Trump sending aides to broker a deal during talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu. There is concern in the United States that the removal of these militants could jeopardize a recent ceasefire and hinder discussions about deploying an international force in Gaza. A Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades leader dismissed any commitment, stating that surrender is not an option for them. Netanyahu’s isolation is increasing his dependence on the United States, which supports him internationally.

The shows, scheduled between November 26 and December 1 in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, were being organized by Alon Yurik Productions. In a statement, the producers expressed regret over the cancellation, claiming that Cleese had succumbed to pressure from the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. The statement also highlighted that all tickets had already been sold. Cleese had previously postponed his shows from June to November due to the ongoing war with Iran. However, his recent social media activity, including reposting videos critical of Israel and its leadership, raised concerns. Among the posts were a video of actor Mandy Patinkin criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and another featuring actor Mark Ruffalo criticizing his Jewish friends.

The firm, best known for Pegasus, has faced a decade of allegations of misuse by governments to spy on journalists, human rights activists, and dissidents. Amnesty International reported Pegasus targeting staff and civil society members in the West Bank in 2018, and later investigations connected Pegasus to surveillance of Jamal Khashoggi’s wife in 2018. In 2025, Amnesty highlighted Pegasus-targeted journalists from a Serbian network. The Biden administration previously blacklisted NSO for supplying spyware to foreign governments, and a 2024 federal ruling found NSO liable for reverse engineering Meta’s WhatsApp to compromise thousands of individuals. A U.S. judge recently allowed WhatsApp to block NSO’s products, a decision NSO is appealing.

In the first quarter of 2025, the country reached a record 1.74 million vacant job positions, the highest number since reunification. The aging population exacerbates the issue, with the elderly making up a larger portion of the population than young people. To address these problems, the government is considering raising the retirement age to 70, as the current gradual increase to 67 is seen as insufficient. The pension system in Germany relies on workers' contributions, but the decreasing workforce threatens its sustainability. Experts argue that immigration is essential to fill labor gaps, and efforts are underway to improve migrant qualification recognition and expand opportunities for vulnerable groups in the workforce. There are also discussions around increasing work hours, but there is skepticism regarding the feasibility and health impact of]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-considers-raising-retirement-age-to-address-workforce-shortages-and-funding-for-rearmament</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-considers-raising-retirement-age-to-address-workforce-shortages-and-funding-for-rearmament</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 17:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Decline of the European Union: A Reality Check]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Union has faced multiple crises in recent years, and a recent editorial in the *Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung* by Nikolas Busse outlines its failures. From the collapse of the EU’s foreign policy ambitions, such as its inability to defend itself against threats and to maintain a role in global politics, to internal issues like the failure of the Stability and Growth Pact and the inability to form a unified asylum policy, the EU's foundations are crumbling. The article argues that European countries are increasingly turning to nationalism as a response to the EU's shortcomings, with countries like Germany emphasizing economic and military strength at the national level over European unity. Busse suggests that the solution is not to reinforce the EU, but to focus on strengthening individual states, pointing to a shift away from the EU's ideal of unity and toward national sovereignty.

Luo, who had been employed at Intel since 2014, was laid off in July 2024 as part of a wave of job cuts within the company. Prior to his departure, Luo allegedly transferred a large volume of confidential data from his work laptop to an external device, which raised alarms within Intel's cybersecurity team. Despite initial failed attempts, he succeeded in copying the files to a personal network-attached storage device just days before his termination. Despite multiple attempts to contact Luo, including phone calls, emails, and physical letters, Intel has been unable to reach him. The company has filed a lawsuit seeking $250,000 in damages and the return of the stolen data. This case is not the first instance of data theft at Intel; another former engineer was caught taking confidential files to secure a job at]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/former-intel-engineer-allegedly-steals-18-000-confidential-files-amid-layoffs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/former-intel-engineer-allegedly-steals-18-000-confidential-files-amid-layoffs</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 07:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump-branded Wines Sold at Military Stores, Raising Ethical Concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wines and ciders from Donald Trump’s personal brand are now available at military-run stores, including those operated by the U.S. Coast Guard, where military personnel and their families can purchase tax-free goods. This move has sparked controversy, as critics point out the potential ethical issues surrounding the sale of Trump-branded products at government facilities. While it may not directly violate legal restrictions, such as the Emoluments Clause, the sale raises questions about the optics of profiting from the presidency. Trump’s businesses, including those operating during his presidency, have faced scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest, especially in light of his extensive brand presence in both domestic and international markets. During his time in office, Trump’s properties were often used by foreign officials, further heightening concerns of inappropriate financial gain.

The analysis compares a 5-ton UOP-like probe needing multiple propellant transfers to reach Uranus, with alternative mission concepts that could boost payload to 25 tons. Aerocapture offers the biggest potential reduction in transit time, but it introduces serious engineering challenges, such as thermal protection on a vehicle exposed to space for seven years and maintaining cryogenic propellants without reliable long-term storage. Without aerocapture, even the Starship’s capabilities leave arrival velocities and propellant needs constrained, potentially requiring nine tanker flights. The study notes that current NASA plans would not launch before 2035, and a venturing into outer solar system exploration hinges on Starship meeting final specifications, p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/starship-could-cut-uranus-travel-time-to-about-6-5-years-with-in-orbit-refueling-and-aerocapture</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/starship-could-cut-uranus-travel-time-to-about-6-5-years-with-in-orbit-refueling-and-aerocapture</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 06:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chris Hedges Critiques Donald Trump as a Modern-Day Dictator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In his article, Chris Hedges draws a stark comparison between Donald Trump and Latin American dictators, arguing that Trump embodies the same authoritarian tendencies seen in past despots who were backed by oligarchs and imperialists. Hedges compares Trump to notorious figures such as Rafael Trujillo, Anastasio Somoza, and François Duvalier, noting their shared characteristics: corruption, violence, and a thirst for self-glorification. He highlights how Trump’s administration reflects the same tactics employed by these dictators to maintain power—manipulating elections, silencing opposition, and spreading dangerous ideologies. Hedges critiques Trump’s policies and behaviors, from his disregard for scientific facts to his alliances with controversial figures like Jeffrey Epstein. He warns that Trump’s leadership has created a world where reality is distorted, and any dissent is labeled as treason.

Roy Brown, a 54-year-old homeless man in Shreveport, Louisiana, robbed a Capital One bank of a single $100 bill, surrendered the next day, and received a 15-year sentence for first-degree robbery. Paul R. Allen, 55, a former CEO of Taylor Bean & Whitaker, was convicted in a multibillion-dollar mortgage fraud scheme connected to the collapse of TBW and related banks. Allen received a 40-month prison term after cooperating with investigators and accounting for mitigating factors, despite the broader financial damage attributed to his role in the scheme. Snopes documents the contrast by citing court records and news coverage, noting limited corroboration for Brown’s case beyond the available sentencing records.

The article discusses projects that use human waste to produce hydrogen, electricity, fertilizer, mineral resources, food, and even potable water. India's massive campaign to end open defecation is highlighted, as it aims to capture biological resources for industrial use. Using the black soldier fly larvae, waste is converted into proteins, lipids, and food ingredients, now legal for human consumption in the EU and other regions.

Francken, known for his controversial stances, had previously defended Israel's actions in Gaza, and now he has escalated tensions with his remarks about Russia. This is not the first time European leaders have made such inflammatory statements; earlier in the war, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire predicted European sanctions would devastate Russia’s economy. However, these bold predictions have not materialized as expected. Instead, Russia’s military production has grown, and reports suggest that the country has found unconventional ways to source materials for its military, including extracting semiconductors from discarded household appliances. The Belgian minister's provocative comments come as NATO and Russia continue their standoff, with growing concerns about the global escalation of the war.

Critics describe this vetting as politically charged and misaligned with the nonpolitical nature of federal careers, calling it a workaround for partisan alignment. Notably, several DOJ divisions, including the Civil Rights Division, have seen high turnover, with many career attorneys leaving and only a few replacements.

According to journalist Tim Weiner, author of 'The Mission,' the CIA had been anticipating military escalation since at least 2014, closely observing Russian military buildups and coded communications near the Ukrainian border. Rather than keeping these observations secret, the CIA and NSA opted for high-profile information disclosures between late 2021 and early 2022, aiming to deter Russian action and shape media narratives—what was referred to as 'preventive intelligence.'

The deployment comes at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow, with fears of a renewed arms race. These bombers, coming from Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, are part of NATO's efforts to increase its influence near Russia's borders. The Pentagon has euphemistically described the mission as part of the 'Bomber Task Force Europe 26-1', a display of military might meant to reinforce deterrence on Europe's eastern flank. This comes shortly after Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that Moscow is preparing nuclear tests in response to U.S. directives. The increasing military posturing follows remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump, who instructed the Department of Defense to resume nuclear testing, accusing Russia and China of conducting underground tests.

This incident is part of a growing trend of similar attacks on Russian diplomatic missions in Sweden, with more than 20 such attacks recorded since May of the previous year. The attacks typically involve drones dropping paint, often in glass containers, which poses a danger of injuries from shards or splashes. The Russian government has repeatedly condemned these actions, stressing that they violate the Vienna Convention of 1961, which obliges host nations to ensure the safety of foreign diplomatic missions. Despite these protests, Swedish authorities have failed to identify or prosecute any suspects, with investigations yielding no results. Russian officials argue that Sweden's inaction reflects a deliberate political stance and a violation of international agreements, as these attacks endanger both diplomatic staff and civilians living near the]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/drone-attack-targets-russian-commercial-mission-in-stockholm-amid-rising-tensions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/drone-attack-targets-russian-commercial-mission-in-stockholm-amid-rising-tensions</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Coal Miners in West Virginia Struggle with Black Lung as Disease Rates Rise]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the coal mining heartland of West Virginia, a growing number of miners, including those in their 30s and 40s, are battling black lung disease, a condition once associated with older workers. Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist and director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, witnesses firsthand the increasing severity of the disease among miners, some of whom require double lung transplants by their mid-40s. As miners are forced to dig through more rock to access coal, they are being exposed to dangerous levels of respirable crystalline silica dust, which is causing rapid deterioration in their health. Despite efforts to protect miners through regulations by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, the risks remain high. Emery is deeply emotional about the plight of these miners and believes that she was put on earth to help them.

The piece traces the career of ex-vice prime minister Arben Ahmetaj, his 2022 expulsion from the party, and his subsequent exile after facing corruption allegations linked to a controversial waste-to-energy project in Elbasan. It discusses how incinerators funded by public money became focal points for alleged graft, with two of three planned facilities completed and one abandoned after significant costs.

A battalion commander cited by CNN described the situation as difficult, with firefights in urban areas and shelling from various weapons, while a Ukrainian drone unit member noted that Russian movement is so rapid that drone operators struggle to keep pace. The delay in Ukrainian command decisions is suggested to risk higher casualties, echoing past experiences in Batmut (2023) and Avdiivka (2024). Pokrovsk’s strategic importance lay in its road and rail connections to Donetsk, Kostyantynivka, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia, serving as a logistics hub for Ukrainian operations and supporting smaller settlements around the area. Since the summer, Russian siege efforts and drone/artillery strikes have pressured Kyiv to reroute supply lines, diminishing Pokrovsk’s logistical role and marking a tactical gain for Russia. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-forces-advance-toward-pokrovsk-amid-extended-urban-combat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-forces-advance-toward-pokrovsk-amid-extended-urban-combat</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 08:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump faces voter appeal on live TV as he touts affordability amid inflation concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a Fox News appearance by President Donald Trump, where he responded to Regina Foley, a three-time Trump voter who urged rapid cost-of-living relief. Foley’s on-air message emphasized struggles on groceries and utilities and warned Republicans about losing Congress in 2026. Trump replied by highlighting declining prices in energy and overall affordability, framing himself as sympathetic to Foley and insisting that prices would continue to fall as energy costs drop. The piece juxtaposes Trump’s claims with statistical context: gasoline averages around $3.12 per gallon (down 8% from 2024), electricity prices rising in multiple states, and grocery prices up year over year.

The pardon proclamation, publicly shared by Ed Martin, the Pardon Attorney, on social media, lists prominent figures including Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, among many others. The document describes the pardons as a “full, complete, and unconditional pardon” and states that they apply to federal offenses, not to state or local charges. The proclamation asserts that the pardons rectify a national injustice and contribute to national reconciliation. Some recipients were co-defendants implicated in legal actions in Georgia related to attempts to undermine Trump’s 2020 loss.

The former president recently hinted at the plan, which administration officials later confirmed. Critics argue that such a proposal would significantly increase the total cost of a home, trapping buyers in debt for much of their lives. For example, a $400,000 house on a 30-year mortgage at 6% interest would cost the buyer around $863,000, but under Trump's 50-year plan, that cost would rise to $1.38 million—half a million more in interest. The idea was labeled a 'spectacularly dumb' move by many, with political figures and commentators pointing out that it would benefit banks while worsening the financial burden on Americans. Others expressed frustration over Trump's perceived lack of understanding regarding housing affordability, and some critics even stated they regretted voting for him, citing the proposal as a prime example of his detachment fr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experts-and-critics-slam-trump-s-proposal-for-50-year-mortgages</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experts-and-critics-slam-trump-s-proposal-for-50-year-mortgages</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 07:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alleged Torture and Abuse of Palestinians in Israeli Detention Centers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Israeli military prosecutor, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, was arrested and removed from her position after leaking a video exposing the torture of Palestinian prisoners at the Sde Teiman concentration camp.

Deforestation in the Amazon is at its lowest level in over a decade, a major factor in the significant reduction in emissions. A new report from the Climate Observatory shows that Brazilian emissions fell by 16.7% in the past year. The decline highlights the impact of federal enforcement against illegal activities by miners, loggers, and farmers who destroy forests for land expansion. While Lula aims to eliminate illegal deforestation by the end of the decade, the country still faces the challenge of widespread fires, which, despite the reductions in deforestation, continue to threaten forest preservation. In 2023, fires were ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/brazil-sees-major-drop-in-emissions-following-crackdown-on-deforestation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/brazil-sees-major-drop-in-emissions-following-crackdown-on-deforestation</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fuel Blockade and External Interventions Deepen Mali's Humanitarian Crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mali is currently facing a major humanitarian crisis due to a persistent fuel blockade that has lasted several weeks. Jihadist groups, particularly JNIM (affiliated with Al Qaeda), have targeted fuel-carrying trucks coming from neighboring countries, escalating by stealing vehicles and kidnapping drivers. This has resulted in a critical shortage of fuel throughout Mali, causing severe disruptions in transportation, electricity supply, and economic activity, especially in the central and southern regions and in the capital, Bamako. Only one out of ten gas stations in Bamako remained operational by late October, with long lines and people waiting overnight for fuel, as attacks continued despite military escorts. The jihadists justify their blockade as a reaction to government policies that limit fuel deliveries to villages cooperating with them, but have now expanded into a nationwide embargo in an attempt to undermine the military-led government, which came to power in 2021.

For a period of about 20 minutes, Trump was seen repeatedly blinking and seemingly fighting to keep his eyes open while attending the meeting. This unusual display raised concerns and prompted further media coverage. The event, part of a broader initiative aimed at addressing healthcare costs, highlighted the challenges Trump faces while balancing his public duties. While the president’s apparent fatigue during the event captured attention, there was no official explanation provided for his behavior at that time. The footage, which was widely shared across social media platforms, sparked a mix of reactions, with some expressing concern for his well-being, while others speculated about the reasons behind his drowsiness. It remains unclear whether this was due to exhaustion, health issues, or another cause.

It provides examples of surveillance technologies, centralized data management, and legal frameworks that enable monitoring and censorship, discussing both historical context and recent policy shifts. The text emphasizes the role of global tech corporations working with state actors to build systems that prioritize control and compliance over privacy or civil liberty. Case studies from various countries highlight the interplay between domestic policy choices and international market pressures, underlining the complexity of digital authoritarianism beyond simple government decrees. The article warns that as data becomes more integral to governance and everyday life, citizens must critically engage with how technical architectures shape freedoms—and how pushback may be necessary to maintain open societies.

This change marks a move toward considering personal character alongside academic achievements in admissions decisions. The rejected students had applied through the regular admissions route, and although they had outstanding scores on the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT), their disciplinary histories related to bullying led to their disqualification. The new policy follows a 2023 scandal where public outrage over the leniency shown to an applicant with a bullying history pushed for stricter measures. Universities like Kyungpook National University and Pusan National University were among those rejecting students for this reason, while others, like Chonnam and Jeju National Universities, did not.

Known for its geysers, which suggest the presence of an ocean beneath its icy surface, Enceladus could hold the key to understanding life beyond Earth. The mission, slated to launch between 2042 and 2046, will involve two Ariane 64 rockets. One will carry the propulsion stage into orbit, while the other will deliver the spacecraft. The mission will include both an orbiter and a lander, with the goal of studying Enceladus up close. The lander will descend to the moon's south pole to analyze geysers and the conditions necessary for life. Despite the challenges, such as the lack of plutonium-based power systems and the distant location of Saturn, the mission is a significant step for the European Space Agency (ESA) and could provide important insights into the potential for life on other planets.

The deceased individual’s identity is crucial for closure for the victim’s family and for Israeli authorities as they continue efforts to understand the full scope of the hostage situation. The circumstances surrounding the individual's death are not yet clear, but Israeli officials are focused on determining how and when the person died. The hostage return is part of a broader effort to repatriate individuals caught in the conflict, and the death of this particular hostage highlights the severe toll on civilians during the ongoing war.

The high number of amputations is being attributed to the severity of battlefield injuries caused by artillery and landmines. Medical experts working on the frontlines have expressed concern over the strain this is putting on Ukraine’s healthcare system, which is already stretched thin by the constant influx of wounded soldiers. The country's doctors are being forced to make difficult decisions on the battlefield, as they try to save soldiers' lives while managing overwhelming numbers of casualties. In addition to the physical and emotional trauma, these amputations are causing long-term challenges for the soldiers, as many will require extensive rehabilitation and prosthetics to lead normal lives after their recovery.

The investigation reveals that Epstein’s protection came not only from his wealth but also from his alleged connections to intelligence agencies like the CIA and Mossad. Epstein, a convicted sex trafficker, operated with apparent immunity, including a controversial 2007 legal deal that protected him and his clients from prosecution. The article also highlights the role of wealthy figures like Les Wexner, whose connections to Epstein enabled his rise, as well as his links to powerful groups like the 'Mega Group,' a circle of prominent Jewish American businessmen.

The march, presented by Morocco as a peaceful, religiously driven demonstration, was supported by tens of thousands of Moroccan civilians. It was intended to force Spain to relinquish control of the territory, leading to a division of Western Sahara between Morocco and Mauritania. Despite the peaceful façade, the operation was heavily orchestrated by the Moroccan military, and its ultimate goal was the annexation of Western Sahara. The author argues that the true nature of the march was a betrayal of the Sahrawi people, who were left without their right to self-determination. The article also critiques the subsequent political and military developments, including the failed UN-backed negotiations for a referendum, and highlights the long-lasting struggle of the Sahrawi people for independence.

One of his sons remains in administrative detention, while another was released in October under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. In the weeks surrounding his death, nearly two thousand Palestinian prisoners were released as part of the ceasefire agreed on October 10.

This marks a significant shift as traditional French stores, including the prestigious Galeries Lafayette, struggle with mounting debt. To stay afloat, they have partnered with Shein, offering up their brands and locations. While Shein's store opening aims to revive these shopping centers, it has sparked controversy. The French government has launched multiple investigations against the company for selling products like sex dolls and weapons, leading to calls for the company’s sanctions.

Despite Trump's claims that his administration has lowered prices, economic data show the cost of goods, including groceries, continues to rise. Trump, unable to answer the question, humorously turned to Leavitt, calling her a 'superstar,' though she was initially outside the room. Once she entered, Leavitt defended Trump's record on affordability, attributing inflation to the crisis inherited from the previous administration. Trump has repeatedly praised Leavitt for her quick responses and even joked about her rapid-fire speech. As the discussion continued, Orban jokingly asked if Leavitt could work for him in Hungary, to which Trump humorously agreed.

The pay for these foreign recruits is just under 3,000 euros per month, and unlike Ukrainian soldiers, they can terminate their contracts at any time. Following the outbreak of the war in February 2022, Ukraine issued a global call for volunteers to join their ranks, leading to the enlistment of about 8,000 mercenaries from various countries, with 40% reportedly coming from South America.

Despite her clear identification as a medical worker, the Israeli military claimed she was a threat or used as a human shield, but a UN investigation concluded otherwise, affirming her murder was intentional. Her death, which occurred just before her engagement to her fiancé, drew international outrage and made her a martyr for the Palestinian cause. The article also discusses the failure of Israel's investigation and the role of international officials, like former British Minister Alistair Burt, who later admitted his mistake in downplaying her death as a war crime.

Durante la recepción en el Despacho Oval, Trump obsequió dos frascos de su exclusiva fragancia 'Victory 45-47' a al-Sharaa, uno masculino y otro femenino. En un gesto que sorprendió a los presentes, Trump roció personalmente el perfume en el cuello del líder sirio y le ofreció otro frasco para su esposa, preguntando en tono jocoso cuántas esposas tenía. Al-Sharaa respondió que solo una, a lo que Trump replicó, demostrando su habitual estilo poco diplomático. El acto fue filmado y difundido por redes sociales. La fragancia, con fines comerciales, se vende como edición limitada por 249 dólares. Mientras Trump usaba la ocasión para promocionar su marca, al-Sharaa optó por regalos tradicional]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-regala-su-perfume-al-presidente-sirio-durante-una-visita-historica-a-la-casa-blanca</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-regala-su-perfume-al-presidente-sirio-durante-una-visita-historica-a-la-casa-blanca</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 18:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Congreso aprueba la Ley de Atención a la Clientela con nuevas medidas contra el spam telefónico y abusos al consumidor]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Congreso de los Diputados ha aprobado este jueves la nueva Ley de Atención a la Clientela con 179 votos a favor, 33 en contra y 138 abstenciones.

En paralelo, se reportó un ataque a una empresa de productos lácteos palestina durante el mismo día, con daños significativos y cuatro sospechosos arrestados. Las autoridades militares israelíes condenaron la violencia y el general Avi Bluth calificó las acciones de inaceptables, aunque no se detallaron medidas concretas.

Este comportamiento eleva el ritmo de crecimiento de las emisiones respecto a 2023 y supera la línea roja de los objetivos de 1,5°C. El estudio alerta que el presupuesto restante de carbono para mantener el calentamiento bajo 1,5°C podría agotarse antes de 2030 si las tendencias actuales continúan.

Rosa Belmonte también se mostró contundente al afirmar que las televisiones públicas deberían desaparecer, mientras que María Dabán aportó ejemplos sobre la supuesta manipulación de personal sanitario en la cadena.

La secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, confirmó que Virginia Giuffre, una exempleada de Mar-a-Lago, era la persona mencionada en los correos electrónicos del fallecido pederasta. La administración negó cualquier implicación de Trump en delitos y acusó a los demócratas de filtrar selectivamente información para desacreditar al presidente, en un intento de desviar la atención de otros asuntos políticos. Los correos en cuestión sugieren que Epstein afirmó que Trump sabía de las actividades de tráfico sexual y que pasaba horas en su casa con una víctima, aunque Trump no figura como remitente ni destinatario directo de estos mensajes, y no hay cargos en su contra.

En Greenland, Alaska, Siberia y Canadá, se utilizaban intestinos de mamíferos como fibra clave para crear tejidos ligeros y resistentes al agua. La estructura natural de los intestinos permitía que una cara repelerá la lluvia y la otra facilitara la evaporación del sudor, gracias a microperforaciones que bloqueaban el agua pero dejaban pasar la humedad. El proceso incluía limpiar, inflar y secar los intestinos, cortarlos en tiras y unirlas con costuras especiales para lograr un tejido impermeable. Aunque la prenda resultaba extremadamente liviana, con ejemplos que pesan apenas 85 gramos, su valor residía en la protección que ofrecía en condiciones árticas extremas, especialmente para cazadores que viajaban en kayaks.

En un futuro distópico, un grupo de jóvenes participa en una caminata sin descanso en la que, si se detienen o reducen la velocidad, enfrentan la muerte. La película no solo muestra la dureza de la prueba física, sino que explora la crítica a una sociedad que ha transformado el sufrimiento en entretenimiento. Con una estética que recuerda a los años 70 y un ritmo narrativo que no ofrece pausas, Lawrence utiliza el agotamiento como una herramienta de horror. Los personajes enfrentan la muerte de manera estoica, rebelde, religiosa o delirante, pero todos comparten la opresión de un sistema que les exige resistencia constante.

La sentencia se refiere a un conflicto laboral que ocurrió entre febrero y mayo de 2023, cuando los empleados de la plataforma paralizaron la actividad para protestar contra el incumplimiento de su convenio, especialmente en lo que respecta a las horas extras. La empresa desvió el trabajo a otros centros con el fin de minimizar los efectos de la huelga, lo que constituye esquirolaje organizativo, una práctica ilegal.

En un evento de La Tribuna de Automoción, Recasens recordó que cuando las marcas europeas entraron en China, el gobierno chino exigió que transfirieran conocimiento y generaran empleo local. Según el directivo, las marcas chinas deberían hacer lo mismo en Europa y aportar tecnología y valor, en lugar de solo ensamblar vehículos con piezas traídas desde China. Además, destacó la importancia del Plan Auto 2030 para el futuro del sector en Europa, señalando la necesidad de adaptarse al cambio hacia la movilidad eléctrica y garantizar que las ayudas a este sector se mantengan. También destacó la urgencia de una planificación a corto plazo en la industria para evitar la destrucción de empleo y la pérdida de competitividad.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recasens-renault-advierte-sobre-la-entrada-de-coches-chinos-a-europa-sin-valor-anadido</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recasens-renault-advierte-sobre-la-entrada-de-coches-chinos-a-europa-sin-valor-anadido</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 08:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El líder de la AfD equipara a Polonia con Rusia como amenaza para Alemania]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tino Chrupalla, co-líder del partido ultraderechista alemán AfD, ha declarado que Polonia representa una amenaza tan grande para Alemania como Rusia. En una entrevista reciente con la cadena pública ZDF, Chrupalla, quien ha sido señalado por sus vínculos con Rusia, defendió su postura de que Rusia no es una amenaza para Alemania. Sin embargo, al ser interrogado sobre las acciones híbridas de Rusia contra los estados europeos, Chrupalla subrayó que cualquier país podría ser una amenaza para Alemania. A continuación, sugirió que Polonia, al no extraditar a un presunto criminal ucraniano involucrado en el sabotaje de los gasoductos Nord Stream, podría ser una amenaza para su país. Estas declaraciones fueron rápidamente condenadas por políticos de otras formaciones, como Roderich Kiesewetter del CDU, que criticó a la AfD por su apoyo implícito a Putin. La polémica refleja las tensiones dentro de la política alemana, especialmente con respecto a las relaciones con Rusia y Polonia.

El proyecto cuenta con Pete Jackson como guionista, un profesional con experiencia reciente en la industria británica y con buena recepción en proyectos previos, como Somewhere Boy, que fue distinguida con nominaciones BAFTA. Aunque Channel 4 había explorado una adaptación previa, Variety ha señalado que HBO podría reiniciar los planes y gestionar el desarrollo sin mantener vínculos directos con las últimas propuestas de DC para otros títulos.

El porcentaje de familias cuyos ingresos no cubren sus gastos pasó del 48% al 31% en un solo año. Esta caída es más evidente en los sectores más vulnerables, donde ha mejorado la capacidad de afrontar necesidades básicas como la compra de útiles escolares, ropa y servicios médicos. A pesar de estos avances, persiste un importante desafío relacionado con el endeudamiento, especialmente entre los hogares de clase media, con un aumento del 8% en el porcentaje de familias con deudas. Aunque la pobreza infantil ha descendido, todavía afecta al 46,1% de los niños, y la pobreza extrema al 10,2%.

Este carné digital se integraría en la identidad digital europea, lo que permitiría un seguimiento más exhaustivo de los conductores. Además, se plantean cursos de reciclaje para conductores mayores de 65 años, que aunque por ahora son voluntarios, se teme que puedan convertirse en obligatorios con el tiempo.

A través de su labor en FACUA, Sánchez señala que la sanción de casi 180 millones de euros impuesta a varias aerolíneas por fraudes en el equipaje de mano fue posible gracias a un cambio en la ley, algo que no habría sucedido sin la intervención política. Para Sánchez, el hecho de que muchas organizaciones de consumidores se abstengan de participar en la política refleja una postura que beneficia a los abusos cometidos por grandes empresas. A lo largo de su intervención, el activista subraya que la política no solo implica formar parte de partidos, sino influir activamente en la toma de decisiones que afectan a los derechos de los ciudadanos, como lo demuestra su defensa de la sanidad pública.

Gago, cuya labor consistió en documentar la violencia policial durante el desalojo de un vecino por una deuda de 45 euros, ha sido acusado de obstrucción al cortejo policial. Esta sanción, basada en la Ley de Seguridad Ciudadana, también conocida como la Ley Mordaza, ha generado preocupación por la aplicación de esta norma contra el ejercicio del periodismo. La Ley Mordaza, en vigor desde 2015, ha sido criticada por otorgar a las fuerzas de seguridad el poder de imponer sanciones sin un proceso judicial previo, y a pesar de los compromisos del gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, aún no ha sido derogada ni reformada de manera significativa.

El motivo de su reincidencia fueron las acusaciones de abuso físico y sexual. Braun, de 42 años, fue acusado de agredir sexualmente a la niñera de sus hijos, a quien sometió a un ataque violento. Además, se le acusa de agredir a un niño de tres años y de amenazar a varias personas en diferentes situaciones. A pesar de la segunda oportunidad que recibió tras el indulto presidencial, Braun no cumplió con las expectativas de reinserción social, lo que ha llevado a su condena. Esta es la octava persona que recibe un perdón o reducción de sentencia por parte de Trump y luego incurre en nuevos delitos.

El comentario ilustra la complicada relación interna dentro del PP, marcada por luchas de poder y tensiones sobre la autonomía de las federaciones regionales.

Servicios como la web de los hospitales HM y herramientas médicas, como la app 'pedidosis.app' que se usa en urgencias, han quedado inaccesibles. Estos bloqueos, aplicados por los proveedores de Internet para cumplir resoluciones judiciales, afectan a dominios alojados en servidores como Cloudflare, que también alojan sitios legítimos. Aunque LaLiga asegura que actúa bajo amparo judicial para proteger sus derechos audiovisuales, la medida ha generado un gran perjuicio colateral.

Sin embargo, la Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) desmintió el problema con los radares, aclarando que su funcionamiento no afectó la previsión meteorológica. Mazón también responsabilizó al Gobierno central de la falta de obras hidráulicas, pero los datos muestran que la Generalitat Valenciana ha sido lenta en ejecutar los fondos destinados a infraestructuras.

Mona al-Harazeen, una mujer gazatí, recuerda con dolor la pérdida de su hijo Yazan, quien murió en un ataque aéreo israelí. Mona regresa al norte de Gaza, donde pasó la mayor parte de su vida, para enterrar a su hijo. Aunque la guerra ha dejado su casa destruida, Mona se enfrenta a precios exorbitantes de productos básicos, como alimentos, y a la falta de recursos esenciales. Muchas familias siguen cocinando sobre hogueras, y la escasez de gas empeora la situación. Jumana, otra mujer de Gaza, relata cómo, a pesar de la tragedia, su familia intenta recuperar una pequeña normalidad, como darles a sus hijas clases privadas.

Esta práctica, conocida como el ‘primer sueño’ y ‘segundo sueño’, no solo era habitual en Europa, sino también en otras partes del mundo, y tenía un impacto significativo en la percepción del tiempo. Sin embargo, con el avance de la iluminación artificial y la Revolución Industrial, el hábito de dormir en dos turnos fue reemplazado por un sueño continuo de ocho horas. Los expertos sugieren que esta transformación ha alterado nuestra relación con el descanso y el paso del tiempo, ya que la exposición continua a la luz artificial afecta nuestro ritmo circadiano. Aunque este cambio parece ser relativamente reciente, investigaciones muestran que en algunas comunidades sin acceso a electricidad, como en Madagascar, las personas siguen manteniendo esta práctica.

La resolución, publicada tras la reclamación presentada el 18 de septiembre, señala que la tarifa promocionada por Iberdrola mostraba precios valle de 0,030 €/kWh y 0,218 €/kWh para el periodo punta, pero limitaba el periodo valle a un máximo del 60% de la energía facturada por periodo de facturación. Este límite implica que el 40% restante se factura al precio del periodo punta, lo que contradice la interpretación de la oferta tal como se presentaba en la web de la empresa. Iberdrola sostiene que la información estaba disponible en preguntas frecuentes y condiciones particulares, pero Autocontrol no ha visto suficiente claridad y ha pedido la rectificación de la publicidad. Esta es la segunda derrota de Iberdrola ante Autocontrol, tras un caso similar en 2024 relacionado con aerotermia y otras c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/autocontrol-exige-rectificacion-a-iberdrola-por-publicidad-enganosa-en-tarifa-para-coches-electricos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/autocontrol-exige-rectificacion-a-iberdrola-por-publicidad-enganosa-en-tarifa-para-coches-electricos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 12:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boeing evita juicio por los accidentes mortales del 737 MAX tras acuerdo con el Departamento de Justicia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos había planteado la posibilidad de llevar a juicio a Boeing por los accidentes mortales de los vuelos 610 de Lion Air y 802 de Ethiopian Airways, en los que murieron 346 personas a bordo de sendos 737 MAX. A pesar de la gravedad de los incidentes, un juez federal ha desestimado el caso tras un acuerdo entre Boeing y el Departamento de Justicia, que se remonta a 2021. En ese acuerdo, la empresa pagó 2.000 millones de euros a las familias de las víctimas y aerolíneas afectadas, pero no se resolvieron cuestiones sobre la cultura de seguridad interna de la compañía. En 2024, un nuevo incidente con un Boeing 737 MAX llevó a las autoridades a reconsiderar el caso, pero en lugar de continuar con el juicio, se llegó a un nuevo acuerdo en 2025, con una multa de 243,6 millones de dólares y la obligación de invertir en programas de seguridad.

En estos viajes, la progresión hacia el objetivo suele depender de generaciones sucesivas, ya que la tripulación original envejece y fallece antes de alcanzar el destino. Se aclara que, aun cuando la distancia interestelar es enorme y la velocidad podría ser muy baja, el viaje no puede realizarse a la velocidad de la luz; por ello, puede requerirse decenas, cientos o incluso miles de años. Se introduce el concepto de nave-arca o arca interestelar, y se mencionan distancias y ejemplos prácticos como Próxima Centauri.

La intervención de Baldoví fue incisiva, poniendo en evidencia la falta de respuestas a cuestiones esenciales sobre la gestión de la emergencia, como su itinerario o el paradero de Mazón esa tarde.

En estos casos, dos familias fueron expulsadas de sus hogares sin el aviso correspondiente, lo que infringe la legislación vigente, como la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil y la Ley Estatal de Vivienda, que prohíben estos desalojos. A pesar de haberse suspendido inicialmente con movilizaciones, los desahucios se llevaron a cabo sin previo aviso, lo que ha sido denunciado por el sindicato como una vulneración de derechos fundamentales, como la defensa judicial y la seguridad jurídica de los afectados.

Los autores sostienen que los océanos han sido clave para el desarrollo del capitalismo global, facilitando rutas comerciales, explotación de recursos y estructuras laborales racializadas, al tiempo que la soberanía del mar ha sido objeto de constantes mecanismos de apropiación: banderas de conveniencia, zonas económicas exclusivas y privatización de recursos. Se analizan conceptos como la “ficción” del mar como espacio sin ley, que permite justificaciones legales y culturales para la privatización y el uso intensivo de los océanos. La conversación aborda temas como la soberanía marítima, la regulación internacional y los retos para hacer cumplir el derecho internacional frente a actores estatales y corporativos.

Según Sánchez, el empresario le ha exigido en reiteradas ocasiones que eliminase la noticia sobre sus prácticas fraudulentas, llegando a proferir amenazas como 'te voy a hundir' o 'no me conoces y me vas a encontrar'.

El texto plantea que, tras décadas de centralización estatal y cambios en la titularidad de las vías, la creación de Adif respondió a una combinación de filosofía de peaje y modernización de estaciones, con la red de alta velocidad y su financiación soportadas por una deuda notable. Se subraya que los fondos son limitados y que la seguridad y conservación de la red requieren priorización entre la alta velocidad y la red convencional.

Aunque la intimidación puede generar miedo y aparentemente aumentar el poder, estos rasgos también dificultan la creación de alianzas y relaciones laborales positivas, lo que neutraliza cualquier ventaja. El estudio, longitudinal y realizado con más de 600 estudiantes estadounidenses, muestra que la extraversión y la sociabilidad sí están asociadas a mejores oportunidades de ascenso.

Además, la diputada acusó a los antifascistas de ser 'los nuevos fascistas', subrayando que quienes se identifican como tales son, en realidad, intolerantes e incluso violentos. Álvarez de Toledo señaló ejemplos como los antifascistas que impiden hablar a otros en universidades, agreden a periodistas o justifican el terrorismo. Estas declaraciones provocaron reacciones entre los asistentes y en los medios, interpretándose por algunos como un intento de legitimar a la extrema derecha.

H., conocido como el Kaki, falleció en la madrugada del domingo en El Coronil (Sevilla) tras recibir una paliza por agredir a su pareja durante la celebración de una boda. El individuo, que contaba con más de un centenar de antecedentes policiales y era investigado por la Guardia Civil como presunto cabecilla de una mafia de okupación, agredió a su pareja en la calle tras una trifulca en el salón de bodas. Varias personas intervinieron para detener la agresión, rodearon al agresor y le propinaron golpes con taburetes. Abraham cayó al suelo y, aunque intentó levantarse, fue inmovilizado hasta la llegada de la Guardia Civil. Poco después, sufrió una parada cardiorrespiratoria y murió. Según informes, la causa de la muerte fue el consumo de alcohol y drogas, no los golpes. La pareja había acudido previamente a un cuartel de la Guardia Civil para denunciar una agresión, pero no presentó denuncia formal. El cadáver fue trasladado al Instituto de Medicin]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-un-hombre-con-numerosos-antecedentes-tras-ser-agredido-por-maltratar-a-su-pareja-en-una-boda-en-sevilla</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-un-hombre-con-numerosos-antecedentes-tras-ser-agredido-por-maltratar-a-su-pareja-en-una-boda-en-sevilla</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recorte de 600.000 euros al presupuesto de las escuelas infantiles municipales de Granada pone en riesgo su estabilidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Granada, gobernado por el PP, ha decidido reducir en casi 600.000 euros la aportación anual para las cuatro escuelas infantiles municipales (Luna, Belén, Arlequín y Duende), que atienden a unos 500 niños de entre 0 y 6 años. La medida, que se produce sin consultar con los patronos de la Fundación Granada Educa, gestora de los centros, ha generado un fuerte rechazo entre las familias y los responsables educativos. Acusan al Consistorio de poner en peligro un modelo educativo de más de 40 años, que se ha caracterizado por su calidad e inclusión. El recorte, que representa cerca del 15% del presupuesto total de estas escuelas, se destinará a equilibrar las cuentas municipales, según el equipo de gobierno. Sin embargo, los opositores y los afectados señalan que las escuelas ya trabajaban con presupuestos ajustados y no tienen margen para absorber esta reducción sin afectar a la calidad educativa. Las familias han solicitado una convocatoria urgente del consejo de patrono]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recorte-de-600-000-euros-al-presupuesto-de-las-escuelas-infantiles-municipales-de-granada-pone-en-riesgo-su-estabilidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recorte-de-600-000-euros-al-presupuesto-de-las-escuelas-infantiles-municipales-de-granada-pone-en-riesgo-su-estabilidad</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 10:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El uso prolongado de melatonina para el insomnio podría aumentar el riesgo de insuficiencia cardíaca]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio reciente ha encontrado que el uso de melatonina para tratar el insomnio durante más de un año se asocia con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar insuficiencia cardíaca en un periodo de cinco años. El análisis comparó a 65.000 adultos con diagnóstico de insomnio que tomaban melatonina con otro grupo que no la utilizaba. Los resultados mostraron que aquellos que tomaron melatonina durante al menos un año presentaron un riesgo un 89% mayor de sufrir insuficiencia cardíaca en comparación con los que no usaron este suplemento. Este hallazgo plantea dudas sobre la seguridad del uso prolongado de la melatonina, especialmente considerando que no se han realizado ensayos clínicos que avalen su consumo a largo plazo. Aunque el estudio tiene limitaciones, como su naturaleza observacional, los expertos coinciden en la necesidad de realizar más investigaciones para confirmar los riesgos y determinar las dosis más seguras para los usuarios.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-prolongado-de-melatonina-para-el-insomnio-podria-aumentar-el-riesgo-de-insuficiencia-cardiaca</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-prolongado-de-melatonina-para-el-insomnio-podria-aumentar-el-riesgo-de-insuficiencia-cardiaca</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 09:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La escasez de jóvenes agricultores amenaza la seguridad alimentaria en la UE]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Comisión Europea advierte que el envejecimiento de las explotaciones agrícolas y la falta de relevo generacional representan un riesgo significativo para la seguridad alimentaria de la Unión Europea. Solo el 12% de los agricultores tiene menos de 40 años y la edad media es de 57 años. En respuesta, Bruselas propone un plan para duplicar la presencia de jóvenes agricultores para 2040, con medidas como un paquete de arranque de hasta 300.000 euros dentro de la Política Agrícola Común (PAC) y un mínimo del 6% del gasto agrícola dedicado a apoyos para jóvenes. Además, se plantea facilitar el acceso a tierras, promover la transferencia de explotaciones y reducir la especulación inmobiliaria agrícola, junto con la apertura del programa Erasmus para jóvenes emprendedores en el sector agrícola y la creación de un observatorio europeo.

Asegura que la gestión regulatoria actual es peor que en el referéndum de 2016 y que la desregulación sensata sería clave para recuperar crecimiento. Farage sostiene que existe una «fuga de riqueza» provocada por la política fiscal del gobierno actual, con la cautela de que si los ricos emigran y dejan de pagar impuestos, los trabajadores podrían enfrentar mayores cargas. Aunque recortaría ciertos gastos y eliminaría políticas como el límite de ayudas familiares, el líder de Reform UK reconoce que, con la deuda y las finanzas públicas actuales, no es realista proponer recortes drásticos.

Aunque la competencia en telecomunicaciones recae sobre los gobiernos nacionales, la propuesta pretende obligar a los Estados miembros a seguir directrices comunes de seguridad. De no hacerlo, los países podrían enfrentarse a sanciones económicas. La propuesta también considera extender las restricciones a las redes de fibra óptica, esenciales para el despliegue de Internet de alta velocidad.

El artículo critica que, en lugar de brindar explicaciones, Mazón se dedicó a deslegitimar a quienes reclaman información y a responsabilizar al Gobierno central, recordando su papel en desmantelar parte del sistema de Emergencias y sugiriendo carencias presupuestarias en la Comunitat.

La decisión forma parte de un proceso más amplio, en el que también se incluyen otros colegios como Pineda y Xaloc, ubicados en L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, que también se desvinculan del sistema concertado.

A lo largo de los años, el expresidente no ha dudado en alardear de los acabados dorados que adornan el despacho presidencial, incluso asegurando que son de oro real. Sin embargo, la polémica surgió cuando se descubrió que algunos de estos adornos dorados se parecen demasiado a las molduras de plástico dorado de la marca Ekena Millwork, que se venden en Home Depot a un precio accesible. Esta controversia estalló cuando, durante una entrevista en Fox News, la presentadora Laura Ingraham cuestionó directamente si las decoraciones eran de la tienda de mejoras para el hogar. Trump negó la acusación, asegurando que sus adornos no provenían de Home Depot, a pesar de las similitudes evidentes.

Aunque aún no se ha abierto un proceso canónico contra él, el Vaticano ha comenzado una investigación interna. Expertos canonistas señalan la falta de medidas cautelares en un caso que ya está en manos del Tribunal de la Rota, único tribunal eclesiástico con jurisdicción en España.

Este incremento está relacionado con cambios legislativos aprobados por el PP y Vox en 2024 que conectaron su salario al puesto de alto cargo en la Generalitat, estableciendo límites y condiciones para evitar pérdidas salariales al trasladarse desde otras administraciones. En concreto, la normativa impuso que ningún alto cargo guarde más del 15% del salario del presidente autonómico (con un tope de 92.000 euros) y que, para la agencia, las cantidades mínimas a percibir no fueran inferiores a las retribuciones previas.

Sin embargo, el escándalo no es que García Ortiz filtrara el correo, sino que el material ya circulaba entre los medios antes de llegar a la Fiscalía. Mientras el acusado de fraude, González Amador, se presenta como víctima de una conspiración, el asesor Miguel Ángel Rodríguez (MAR), encargado de propagar los rumores, es el verdadero instigador de la falsedad.

Aunque esta cifra se convirtió en un estándar de referencia, en realidad no representaba la capacidad real del disquete, sino una convención técnica y de marketing. Los disquetes de alta densidad podían almacenar datos en 80 pistas por cara, con dos caras grabables y 18 sectores por pista. Cada sector contenía 512 bytes, lo que daba un total de 1.474.560 bytes. Sin embargo, se utilizó el sistema binario y decimal para redondear esta cifra, resultando en los 1,44 MB. Este límite de almacenamiento obligó a los usuarios a comprimir o dividir archivos, lo que hizo que cada megabyte fuera valioso en aquella época. Aunque el formato fue reemplazado rápidamente por CDs y USBs, el disquete de 1,44 MB se mantuvo como un símbolo de la era digital temprana.

Su intervención estuvo marcada por una falta de autocrítica, ya que evitó dar explicaciones claras y leyó un discurso preparado, lo que generó un gran enfado entre la oposición. Mazón defendió su actuación durante la tragedia, señalando que no había tenido toda la información necesaria sobre la magnitud del desastre. Durante la sesión, se hizo referencia a la polémica sobre sus llamadas telefónicas y su presencia en un almuerzo mientras se desarrollaba la tragedia. Además, su actitud fue rechazada por los familiares de las víctimas, que se concentraron en las puertas de Les Corts pidiendo justicia y responsabilidades. La comparecencia de Mazón también generó tensiones dentro de la comisión, ya que los diputados de la oposición le reprocharon su falta de empatía y responsabilidad.

Sin embargo, los viajes al Sistema Solar exterior, como Urano, suelen ser extremadamente largos. Mientras que una sonda convencional como la UOP tomaría entre 13 y 14 años para llegar a Urano, un estudio del MIT sugiere que la Starship de SpaceX podría reducir ese tiempo a solo 6,5 años. Esto se lograría mediante aerocaptura en la atmósfera de Urano, una maniobra arriesgada pero eficiente. La Starship, gracias a su capacidad de repostaje en órbita, podría alcanzar cualquier rincón del Sistema Solar con menores costos, aunque se deben resolver varios desafíos tecnológicos, como el manejo de propelentes durante largos periodos y la resistencia del escudo térmico durante la aerocaptura. Esta nueva posibilidad de reducir tiempos de vuelo y aumentar la carga útil podría revolucionar las misiones de exploración a Urano y otros planetas del Sistema Solar exterior.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-starship-podria-reducir-el-tiempo-de-viaje-a-urano-a-menos-de-siete-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-starship-podria-reducir-el-tiempo-de-viaje-a-urano-a-menos-de-siete-anos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 04:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El ICE planea monitorear redes sociales de forma continua para controlar la inmigración]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) de Estados Unidos ha dado un paso importante en su estrategia de vigilancia al plantear la implementación de un programa de monitoreo de redes sociales las 24 horas del día, 7 días a la semana. Este plan incluye plataformas como Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X (anteriormente Twitter) y LinkedIn, con el objetivo de rastrear personas de interés, como migrantes o potenciales amenazas. Aunque la agencia ya utiliza herramientas de inteligencia artificial para vigilar redes sociales, esta nueva iniciativa ampliaría la escala de la vigilancia, transformando las interacciones cotidianas en una fuente de información que alimenta bases de datos gubernamentales y comerciales.

Esta medida llega tras el reciente ataque realizado por la Administración Trump a estas embarcaciones, que resultó en la muerte de seis personas. Fuentes del Ejecutivo británico explican que la decisión se basa en el temor de que la información proporcionada por Reino Unido pudiera ser utilizada por los estadounidenses para atacar objetivos, lo que les coloca en una posición incómoda. La postura de Londres se aleja de la de su aliado estadounidense, con quien ha cooperado estrechamente durante años en el ámbito de la lucha contra el narcotráfico en América Latina. Este giro en la política de Reino Unido podría estar relacionado con las crecientes críticas internacionales a las acciones de la Administración Trump, que han sido tachadas de violar el Derecho Internacional.

Sin embargo, el impacto real sobre el crecimiento económico no es tan claro. En un nuevo estudio, se reevaluaron los efectos de estos megaeventos en 147 países entre 1991 y 2023, analizando variables como el turismo, el empleo en el sector servicios y el PIB per cápita. Aunque en algunos casos hubo un leve aumento en el empleo y el turismo durante los eventos, los beneficios no fueron duraderos ni significativos. Los Juegos Olímpicos mostraron un leve aumento en el PIB per cápita, pero los Mundiales no mostraron impacto alguno en este aspecto. Además, los efectos variaron según el país y el evento. En general, los megaeventos deportivos generan algunos beneficios temporales, pero los costes son elevados y los efectos suelen ser limitados a corto plazo.

Según la denuncia de un escritor italiano, personas cercanas a círculos de extrema derecha y fanáticas de las armas viajaban a Bosnia para disparar a civiles desde las colinas que rodeaban la ciudad sitiada. Estos turistas de guerra, por una cantidad de entre 80.000 y 100.000 euros, se convertían en francotiradores de fin de semana, eludiendo la ley bajo la cobertura de excursiones de caza. El escritor Ezio Gavazzeni, apoyado por figuras como el exmagistrado Guido Salvini y la exalcaldesa de Sarajevo Benjamina Karic, ha documentado esta práctica en una denuncia respaldada por testimonios y archivos clasificados de los servicios de inteligencia.

Se utiliza el marco teórico de diversas obras literarias y estudios de Hannah Arendt para argumentar que lo que se describe no es simplemente un fallo político aislado, sino un mecanismo estructural de poder: concentrar la autoridad, control de instituciones, represión de disidencia y manipulación de la información. El texto señala que las medidas ejecutivas, recortes presupuestarios, manipulación electoral y la vigilancia de censos y sistemas de votación están diseñadas para garantizar resultados favorablemente sesgados. También critica la cultura de la adoración al líder, la kitsch política y la propaganda que busca glorificar al gobernante a expensas de libertades civiles.

A pesar de los intentos por reforzar la unión, como la invocación de una política exterior común, la falta de unidad y los fracasos en ámbitos clave como la defensa, la migración y la política económica han puesto en peligro el proyecto europeo. La publicación de un editorial en el Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ha resumido estos problemas, destacando el declive de Europa en términos de su capacidad de actuación política y económica.

Este análisis, realizado por Lauri Myllyvirta del Centro de Investigación sobre Energía y Aire Limpio (Crea), señala que los avances en las energías renovables, especialmente la solar y la eólica, han jugado un papel crucial en este cambio. En los primeros nueve meses de 2025, China añadió 240 GW de capacidad solar y 61 GW de energía eólica. A pesar de que la demanda de electricidad ha aumentado, las emisiones del sector energético se han mantenido estables. Sin embargo, China también enfrenta retos para reducir la intensidad de carbono (emisiones de CO2 por unidad de producto interior bruto) y alcanzar sus metas a largo plazo, como la neutralidad de carbono para 2060.

Los préstamos abarcan financiación sin intereses de hasta cinco años, deudas de tarjetas de crédito y pequeños préstamos de 300 a 900 euros. Los inversores obtendrán rendimientos variables según el riesgo, con tramos que pagan entre 0,87% sobre euríbor y hasta 6,2% en tramos de mayor riesgo.

Según un informe del CIS, ocho de cada diez ciudadanos considera que los impuestos no se distribuyen de manera justa, y la mitad cree que ya paga demasiado. El sindicato de técnicos de Hacienda (Gestha) denuncia que los controles se concentran en particulares, autónomos y pymes, mientras que los grandes evasores apenas son investigados. Además, desde la sociedad civil, han nacido iniciativas como el Movimiento Acción por los Contribuyentes, que busca visibilizar lo que consideran abusos por parte de Hacienda, especialmente en lo relativo a multas desproporcionadas y procedimientos poco transparentes.

En contraste, Paul R. Allen, entonces directivo de Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, recibió 40 meses por participación en un fraude de 2.9 mil millones de dólares que colapsó la firma y afectó a múltiples bancos y a la economía estadounidense, destacando la aparente diferencia de trato entre un delincuente de bajos recursos y un ejecutivo de alto nivel. La noticia subraya que Brown se entregó voluntariamente tras sentirse arrepentido, mientras la narrativa sobre Allen se centra en su rol en un esquema financiero de gran escala y su cooperación con las autoridades. Snopes verifica detalles como fechas, sentencias y las circunstancias de cada caso, y señala que la comparación carece de una cobertura detallada en varios frentes periodísticos, lo que dificulta una evalua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-disparidad-en-las-sentencias-entre-un-hombre-homeless-y-un-ejecutivo-acusado-de-fraude</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-disparidad-en-las-sentencias-entre-un-hombre-homeless-y-un-ejecutivo-acusado-de-fraude</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 21:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[RUFIÁN: 'Los EXTRANJEROS COMPRAN un 20% de los pisos, pero los MALOS son los que llegan en CAYUCO']]></title><description><![CDATA[En este vídeo, Gabriel Rufián aborda el tema de la compra de viviendas por parte de extranjeros en España y la inmigración ilegal, contrastando ambos temas y generando polémica con sus declaraciones sobre los 'malos' inmigrantes que llegan en cayucos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rufian-los-extranjeros-compran-un-20-de-los-pisos-pero-los-malos-son-los-que-llegan-en-cayuco</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rufian-los-extranjeros-compran-un-20-de-los-pisos-pero-los-malos-son-los-que-llegan-en-cayuco</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 20:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[PP y Vox abandonan el Congreso mientras Rufián alerta sobre la crisis de la vivienda]]></title><description><![CDATA[En una sesión televisada del Congreso, el diputado de Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, Gabriel Rufián, subió a la tribuna para exponer una proposición de ley centrada en medidas fiscales para frenar la especulación inmobiliaria y facilitar el acceso a la vivienda. Justo antes de su intervención, los diputados del PP y Vox abandonaron la sala, dejando al parlamentario catalán solo en un hemiciclo semivacío. Rufián subrayó que la vivienda es uno de los problemas centrales del país y aportó datos para contextualizar la magnitud de la cuestión: se necesitarían 59 años de salario para comprar un piso de sesenta metros, y una parte considerable de las compras de vivienda se realizan al contado. Además, utilizó una analogía sobre el precio del pan para ilustrar el impacto de la subida de la vivienda.

Aunque las aplicaciones continúan funcionando para aquellos usuarios que ya las habían descargado, ya no es posible obtenerlas de nuevo. Además, una versión reducida de Blued permanece disponible, lo que sugiere que las autoridades chinas mantienen el control sobre qué servicios son permitidos en línea.

La intervención más destacada será la creación de una gran grieta horizontal que atravesará la explanada del recinto, eliminando la escalinata vertical y generando un vestíbulo circular con acceso tanto a la basílica como a un nuevo centro de interpretación. A pesar de los cambios, la gran cruz de piedra de 150 metros de altura se mantendrá, ya que no se contempla su demolición.

Torres formaba parte de las 40 personas más mayores del mundo según el Gerontology Research Group (GRG), organismo que verifica la edad de los supercentenarios. Durante su vida, destacó por su fortaleza y sabiduría, valores recordados por el presidente de la Generalitat, Salvador Illa, quien ha resaltado una frase inspiradora de la centenaria sobre la importancia de la solidaridad. Torres fue la última catalana nacida antes de la Primera Guerra Mundial y, como quinta entre siete hermanos, estudió en el colegio de las Salesianas, recordando su infancia en una Barcelona mucho menos desarrollada que la actual.

España sufrió una grave crisis económica derivada del aislamiento internacional y la política autárquica impulsada por el régimen de Franco. Durante este periodo, la población española vivió con racionamientos, escasez de alimentos, y salarios hundidos, mientras la represión política golpeaba a los derrotados. La autarquía, que buscaba la autosuficiencia del país, resultó ser un fracaso económico que profundizó la crisis. A pesar de la escasez de recursos, el régimen trató de mantener el control social y económico mediante medidas como la fijación de precios y el racionamiento, pero estas políticas solo incrementaron el mercado negro. La dictadura también debilitó las bases de la economía con una estructura fiscal ineficaz y una escasa inversión en sectores clave.

Marhuenda argumentó que TVE está promoviendo una campaña en contra del político gallego, presentándolo como un líder incapaz de controlar su partido, el PP, y de tomar decisiones firmes en momentos clave. Según Marhuenda, esta actitud responde a la influencia de un aparato propagandístico alineado con el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez.

La causa se cerró después de que la menor, que es de origen romaní, declarara que su traslado fue voluntario y con el consentimiento de sus padres. Según su testimonio, no hubo ningún tipo de coerción, lo que llevó al juez a considerar su declaración como la principal evidencia para archivar el caso. Los padres de la menor, detenidos inicialmente por vender a su hija por 5.000 euros y otros bienes, fueron puestos en libertad. La menor había sido localizada en Lleida, donde se encontraba mendigando, y fue llevada a un centro de protección. La operación fue realizada por la Guardia Civil y los Mossos d’Esquadra, tras una denuncia de Servicios Sociales. Aunque inicialmente se creyó que se trataba de un matrimonio forzado, la falta de pruebas adicionales llevó al archivo del caso.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/archivan-el-caso-de-la-presunta-venta-de-una-menor-para-un-matrimonio-forzado-tras-su-declaracion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/archivan-el-caso-de-la-presunta-venta-de-una-menor-para-un-matrimonio-forzado-tras-su-declaracion</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aznar cuestiona la legitimidad del Gobierno de Sánchez sin fundamentos constitucionales claros]]></title><description><![CDATA[José María Aznar, expresidente del Gobierno, ha declarado que el actual Ejecutivo de Pedro Sánchez carece de legitimidad, asegurando que ha perdido la legitimidad de ejercicio al negarse a convocar una cuestión de confianza en el Parlamento. Según Aznar, este comportamiento coloca al gobierno fuera de las normas constitucionales, sugiriendo que tal negativa equivale a una reforma constitucional encubierta. Sin embargo, el catedrático de Filosofía del Derecho Ramón Soriano desmiente estas afirmaciones, señalando que el Gobierno de Sánchez cumple con los requisitos constitucionales para su legitimidad de origen y ejercicio. Soriano explica que la Constitución Española establece claramente cómo deben entenderse ambos tipos de legitimidad y argumenta que el rechazo a convocar una cuestión de confianza no implica ilegitimidad, ya que esta herramienta es de libre disposición del presidente.

Su mandato, que comenzó en 2011, ha sido calificado por muchos de 'neoliberal', priorizando los beneficios económicos sobre la labor social y evangelizadora. Esta actitud ha provocado múltiples enfrentamientos con el clero, organizaciones sociales y víctimas de su gestión. Además, las críticas no solo provienen de los trabajadores despedidos, sino también de sacerdotes como Rafael Vez, quien tras denunciar públicamente los abusos de poder de Zornoza, fue suspendido de sus funciones por más de cuatro años. En paralelo, el obispo ha estado involucrado en una serie de decisiones que han afectado a los más desfavorecidos de la provincia, incluyendo el desahucio de una pareja de ancianos y el cierre de centros de apoyo a migrantes, mie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mandato-del-obispo-zornoza-abusos-despidos-y-desahucios-en-cadiz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mandato-del-obispo-zornoza-abusos-despidos-y-desahucios-en-cadiz</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 16:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Soldado de las IDF agrede a manifestantes en evento ‘combate en el campus’ en Toronto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra un incidente en el que un soldado de las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (IDF) agrede a varios manifestantes durante un evento titulado ‘combat on campus’ en Toronto, donde se estaba discutiendo el conflicto israelí-palestino.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/soldado-de-las-idf-agrede-a-manifestantes-en-evento-combate-en-el-campus-en-toronto</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/soldado-de-las-idf-agrede-a-manifestantes-en-evento-combate-en-el-campus-en-toronto</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 16:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[JADE: De la adversidad a la cima musical con su primer álbum en solitario]]></title><description><![CDATA[JADE ha recorrido un largo y desafiante camino para llegar a donde está hoy.

Su paso por TheXfactor y su integración en la exitosa banda Little Mix no fueron suficientes para definir su carrera, y ahora, con su primer álbum en solitario, 'That’s Showbiz Baby', demuestra que tiene talento, criterio y una visión propia del pop. El álbum ha tardado más de un año en materializarse, pero ha valido la pena la espera.

Ante esta situación crítica, el presidente Masoud Pezeshkian ha señalado que podría haber racionamiento de agua entre finales de noviembre y principios de diciembre si la situación no mejora. En la actualidad, el 70% de los residentes de Teherán consume 130 litros de agua al día, y se les pide reducir el consumo un 20%.

En 2025, se registra la muerte de al menos un menor cada semana por disparos de soldados o colonos israelíes, con total impunidad. El caso de Mohamed al Halaq, de 9 años, ilustra la brutalidad: fue abatido mientras jugaba al fútbol, y su familia relata cómo el trayecto al hospital se alargó por miedo a los militares. Testigos y organizaciones denuncian que los niños son sistemáticamente acusados de lanzar piedras o artefactos, incluso sin pruebas, y que en muchos casos se les califica de 'terroristas'. Las investigaciones militares rara vez tienen consecuencias, y los ataques de colonos, protegidos por el ejército, han aumentado en número y violencia, especialmente durante la recogida de la aceituna.

A 1 de octubre de 2025, la población residente en el país se situaba en 49.442.844, un aumento de 105.488 personas respecto al trimestre anterior. Aunque la natalidad sigue cayendo, con una disminución de nacimientos nacionales en comparación con años anteriores, la inmigración ha sido la principal causa de este aumento poblacional. Durante el tercer trimestre de 2025, el número de inmigrantes ascendió a más de 115.000, con los colombianos, españoles y marroquíes como las nacionalidades más numerosas. Las comunidades autónomas que han experimentado los mayores crecimientos son la Comunidad Valenciana, Aragón y Castilla-La Mancha.

El Ayuntamiento, liderado por Izquierda Unida en coalición con el PSOE, ha establecido un protocolo que permite a los vecinos autorizar al consistorio para representarlos judicialmente y solicitar medidas cautelares, incluida la orden de alejamiento. Este enfoque surge como respuesta a un notable incremento en los robos con fuerza en viviendas, registrando un aumento del 95,6% en el segundo trimestre de 2025, y busca salvaguardar a la ciudadanía ante delincuentes habituales. El procedimiento, denominado protocolo exprés, facilita que la víctima acuda a la Guardia Civil para denunciar y, con la autorización municipal, que los servicios jurídicos gestionen todo el proceso, desde la denuncia hasta la petición de medidas ante el juez.

En un vídeo grabado en la tienda, se muestra cómo los precios 'rebajados' son más altos que los originales, engañando a los consumidores. El caso más llamativo involucra un altavoz Vieta Pro Party 22, que aparece con un precio 'rebajado' de 249,99 euros, cuando en la etiqueta original se veía claramente un precio previo de 199,99 euros. Otro caso similar afecta a un modelo de altavoz Vieta Party 11, cuyo precio marcado como rebajado es también más alto que el anterior. Este incidente ha generado una ola de críticas en redes sociales, especialmente durante el Black Friday, periodo conocido por sus supuestos descuentos masivos.

Jean Carroll. El caso se originó por una presunta agresión ocurrida a mediados de los años 90 en una tienda de Nueva York, y Trump negó las acusaciones, calificándolas de inventos para dañar su imagen política y comercial. En 2024, una corte federal confirmó el veredicto y la sentencia, descartando errores que justificaran un nuevo juicio, pese a que el juez permitió testimonios de varias testigos y la difusión de un video de Access Hollywood que supuso un elemento clave en la difusión de las acusaciones. Trump sostiene que el juez cometió numerosos errores al permitir ciertas pruebas y que Carroll tardó más de dos décadas en presentar la acusación, lo que, en su opinión, minaría la credibilidad de las denuncias.

El cáñamo industrial, el principal producto de estas tiendas, es legal en España siempre que cumpla con los límites establecidos de THC, pero muchos empresarios aseguran que sus establecimientos han sido objeto de acoso y detenciones ilegales. Dos afectados, Ramón Merino y Pablo Gutiérrez, han presentado una querella contra un agente de la Policía Municipal de Madrid, al que acusan de detenciones arbitrarias, coacciones y abuso de autoridad. A pesar de que las causas contra ellos fueron archivadas, los empresarios denuncian que estas actuaciones ilegales han afectado gravemente a sus negocios, provocando el cierre de algunas tiendas.

Varias organizaciones de defensa de derechos humanos sostienen que la revocación de su visa ocurrió sin aviso y atribuyen la detención a sus críticas públicas a las acciones de Israel.

Se detalla el contexto de precariedad económica, descontento social y la caída del Segundo Imperio, que impulsaron a obreros, artesanos y vecinos a organizarse. Las barricadas emergen como elementos centrales de la resistencia física y del poder popular, construidas con adoquines, mobiliario y vigas, y elevadas en barrios como Belleville, Montmartre y el Marais. Estas estructuras variaban desde simples acumulaciones de piedras hasta fortificaciones con troneras para fusiles, reflejo de la supremacía numérica del ejército de Versalles y la necesidad de conocimiento del terreno urbano. Durante la Semana Sangrienta (21-28 de mayo de 1871), las barricadas fueron el último refugio de la Comuna, enfrentando la artillería y el fuego de fusil hasta su caída.

La ley, que aún debe ser aprobada en dos lecturas más, ha generado controversia, especialmente por su aplicación retroactiva, lo que podría permitir la ejecución de cientos de palestinos detenidos desde el 7 de octubre de 2023. Organizaciones de derechos humanos denuncian que esta medida podría ser usada para legitimar 'ejecuciones masivas' y acusan al gobierno israelí de promover una ley más orientada a la venganza que a la disuasión.

Un ejemplo claro es la planta de baterías de CATL en Figueruelas, Zaragoza, donde el personal empleado para su construcción proviene mayoritariamente de China, lo que genera inquietud sobre el futuro del empleo local. El comisario advirtió que la industria automotriz de la UE podría enfrentar serios riesgos a largo plazo si no se toman medidas para protegerla frente a esta competencia.

La sentencia resultó en 5 meses de arresto mayor para Diego, quien, tras cumplir la condena, apareció muerto en un aparente suicidio. Este hecho conmocionó a la comunidad y desató una ola de indignación que llevó al Consejo General del Poder Judicial (CGPJ) a revisar los delitos de escándalo público y desacato. Pese a las manifestaciones en la localidad, el juez que instruyó el caso, Antonio Navarro Castillo, no enfrentó medidas disciplinarias. La tragedia provocó una reflexión sobre la legislación y la moral de la época, aunque fue demasiado tarde para evitar la tragedia que marcó la vida de ambos jóvenes.

Este acto no fue solo una decisión política, sino una necesidad impuesta por las circunstancias de la época, marcadas por la invasión napoleónica. Desde el comienzo de la guerra en 1808, las transformaciones políticas en España llevaron a la aparición de ideas y debates políticos que, hasta entonces, solo eran conocidos por una pequeña élite intelectual. Aunque el reconocimiento legal de la libertad de imprenta no ocurrió hasta 1810, en la práctica ya se había estado llevando a cabo durante dos años debido a la imposibilidad de controlar todos los materiales escritos en tiempos de guerra.

El crimen ocurrió el 6 de enero de 1991, pero la desaparición de la joven no fue denunciada hasta 1995. El asesino, un hombre de La Felguera, confesó tras ser delatado por su pareja, aunque siempre negó conocer a la víctima. Según su relato, recogió a la joven cuando hacía autostop y, tras un intento de robo por parte de ella, la apuñaló y la enterró en cal viva junto a su pareja. La investigación se reactivó en 2023 gracias al análisis de ADN, lo que permitió identificar los restos de la joven. Este caso, que inicialmente fue un misterio, ahora ha llegado a su resolución después de más de tres décadas de búsqueda. La clave de su resolución fue el avance de la tecnología forense y la coordinación de diversos cuerpos policiales.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guardia-civil-identifica-a-la-victima-del-crimen-de-reyes-sucedido-en-1991</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guardia-civil-identifica-a-la-victima-del-crimen-de-reyes-sucedido-en-1991</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 10:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[MAGA y la redefinición del Partido Republicano: lealtad, disciplina y cambios estructurales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de HuffPost analiza la evolución del Partido Republicano desde la llegada de Donald Trump al poder y la consolidación del movimiento MAGA como una ideología dominante dentro de la formación. Se describe cómo Trump ha privilegiado a un núcleo de confianza, desplazando al establishment y promoviendo una narrativa de renacer ante cambios económicos y geopolíticos. Se destacan cambios en la estructura interna del partido, con una mayor influencia de activistas de base y una reducción de espacios para la disidencia, así como la ascensión de figuras leales que ejecutan estratégicamente las políticas del presidente. El texto también aborda las tensiones internas entre distintas corrientes dentro de MAGA, desde posiciones más religiosas hasta enfoques más seculares, y las fricciones con antiguos republicanos que cuestionan políticas de comercio, alianzas internacionales y apoyo a Ucrania.

Estos asentamientos ilegales representan un grave riesgo tanto para las personas que los habitan como para el medio ambiente, ya que se encuentran en zonas con alta probabilidad de inundación. La Comunidad ha iniciado un plan de vigilancia para erradicar estas construcciones y proteger el entorno natural. En los últimos años, las inspecciones han identificado miles de construcciones irregulares, lo que ha llevado a sanciones, demoliciones y procedimientos legales. Las autoridades subrayan la necesidad de actuar de manera urgente para evitar tragedias, como la ocurrida en marzo, cuando más de 400 personas fueron evacuadas de un poblado afectado por las lluvias.

A sus 78 años, muestra su escepticismo sobre la política actual, especialmente sobre el auge de la extrema derecha y las fracturas internas en la izquierda. En particular, se refiere a Pablo Iglesias, al que considera una figura polémica dentro de la política española, criticando que un político consulte a sus bases si debe comprarse un chalé. Para Víctor Manuel, esta acción es un ejemplo de las contradicciones dentro de la política de izquierda. Además, aborda temas como la desigualdad, el capitalismo y la falta de solidaridad en la sociedad actual, mientras denuncia la división que afecta a los movimientos progresistas. El cantautor destaca que, aunque Podemos logró conectar con muchas personas, no ha conseguido unificar a la izquierda, y considera que este partido ha contribuido más a dividir que a unir.

La falta de un hogar estable impide a muchos niños y adolescentes poder concentrarse y desarrollarse en el ámbito escolar. La pobreza infantil y la inseguridad habitacional son factores que afectan de manera directa al rendimiento académico y la salud mental del alumnado, sobre todo en barrios de alta segregación como Villaverde y Carabanchel en Madrid. Se destacan situaciones como el hacinamiento, los desahucios invisibles, y las dificultades emocionales de los niños debido a las condiciones de vida precarias.

Además, denunció la creación de un 'banco de horas' que permitiría a las empresas modificar unilateralmente las horas laborales semanales, y criticó la posibilidad de que las indemnizaciones se paguen en cuotas, lo que, según él, profundiza la inseguridad de los trabajadores.

Las sanciones, que pueden ser comerciales, financieras y tecnológicas, buscan debilitar las economías de los países objetivo, pero tienen consecuencias devastadoras para los ciudadanos inocentes. Según estudios, estas medidas han causado millones de muertes, principalmente entre niños y personas mayores, a lo largo de las últimas décadas. A pesar de su brutalidad, las sanciones rara vez logran los objetivos políticos de cambio de régimen o modificación de comportamientos, lo que convierte a estas medidas en una forma de crueldad innecesaria y dañina.

Filtraciones recientes revelan que el borrador del proyecto, denominado 'Ómnibus Digital', propone cambios que afectarán tanto la definición de 'datos personales' como los derechos de los ciudadanos en cuanto a la protección de sus datos. Además, se daría luz verde al uso masivo de datos personales por parte de grandes empresas tecnológicas, como Google, Meta y OpenAI, para entrenar inteligencia artificial. Este cambio podría dejar a los datos sensibles, como los relativos a la salud, orientación sexual o ideología política, con menos protección. La reforma también permitiría el acceso remoto a los datos de los usuarios sin su consentimiento.

Se destaca que, tras casi cuarenta años de poder, el exmonarca ahora se queja del trato recibido por parte de España, a pesar de haber vivido por encima de la ley y haber amasado una fortuna millonaria en paraísos fiscales. El texto recuerda que su llegada al poder fue consecuencia de la dictadura franquista y que la Transición no permitió un referéndum para decidir entre monarquía o república, lo que ha generado descontento histórico. Se critica la figura del 'rey emérito' como una invención sin parangón en otras monarquías democráticas, que le otorga impunidad vitalicia. El artículo también se burla de su nuevo libro de memorias, titulado 'Reconciliación', en el que el exmonarca se lamenta de su aislamiento y pide perdón, pero sin asumir responsabilidades ni devolver el dinero acumulado. Se exige que, si realmente quiere reconciliarse con el pueblo, devuelva los ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rey-emerito-y-sus-lamentos-una-critica-a-la-impunidad-y-la-opulencia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rey-emerito-y-sus-lamentos-una-critica-a-la-impunidad-y-la-opulencia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 06:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La central nuclear de Cofrentes sufre una parada no programada sin riesgo para la seguridad]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 10 de noviembre de 2025, la central nuclear de Cofrentes (Valencia) experimentó una parada no programada debido a un fallo eléctrico en una de las fases del equipo, lo que activó automáticamente la protección del turboalternador. A pesar del incidente, el Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear (CSN) ha confirmado que no hubo impacto en la instalación ni riesgos para las personas ni el medio ambiente. Los sistemas de seguridad respondieron conforme al diseño de la planta, y tras el suceso, se llevaron a cabo inspecciones y verificaciones que confirmaron que no existían anomalías adicionales. La planta se encuentra actualmente en modo de parada caliente, alimentada por una línea de 138 kV, con la línea de 400 kV disponible y todos los generadores diésel operativos.

Este lunes, su casa fue dañada por una excavadora durante las obras de demolición de un edificio contiguo. Joaquín, quien denuncia un ‘acoso urbanístico’ por parte de la empresa constructora Resigal, ha sido agredido por el jefe de obra después de intentar frenar el daño a su vivienda, que sufre grietas y daños por las obras. Según Joaquín, los trabajos no tienen licencia para afectar a su propiedad y acusa a los responsables de querer forzarlo a abandonar su casa, una denuncia que incluye malas prácticas y corrupción en el proceso. El Ayuntamiento de Vigo asegura que la demolición tiene licencia y está autorizada judicialmente, pero Joaquín no ve avances en la resolución del conflicto y acusa a las autoridades de no intervenir de forma efectiva.

A pesar de que la mayoría de sus compañeros del Partido Popular Europeo (PPE) apoyaron la medida, el PP español se desmarcó y se alineó con la extrema derecha, incluidos partidos como Vox y otras formaciones negacionistas del cambio climático. Esta postura del PP español llega en un contexto de negociaciones con Vox para la formación de un nuevo gobierno en la Comunidad Valenciana. Fuentes del PPE justifican el voto afirmando que la propuesta es demasiado ambiciosa y difícil de cumplir, especialmente considerando la antigüedad del parque automovilístico y el uso de combustibles fósiles en el país. Sin embargo, este voto se produce en un momento de tensión política, con críticas de la izquierda que señalan que el PP está buscando la aprobación de Vox en las negociaciones valencianas. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-se-alinea-con-la-ultraderecha-en-bruselas-contra-la-reduccion-de-emisiones-de-2040</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-pp-se-alinea-con-la-ultraderecha-en-bruselas-contra-la-reduccion-de-emisiones-de-2040</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 04:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olivia Rodrigo impide el uso de su canción en vídeo oficial de la administración Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[La cantante Olivia Rodrigo reaccionó ante la utilización de una de sus canciones, All-American Bitch, en un vídeo de la Casa Blanca y del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional que mostraba la deportación de migrantes.

Aunque el mensaje inicial se eliminó posteriormente, el vídeo siguió mostrando la música de fondo hasta que se sustituyó por un aviso que indica que la canción no está disponible.

Este incidente ha generado gran revuelo en los medios de comunicación, especialmente en el programa de Ana Rosa Quintana, donde la presentadora planteó si la rotonda estaba adecuadamente señalizada, sugiriendo que podría haber influido en el accidente. Durante el programa, la conversación derivó en un tono humorístico, con otros tertulianos comentando que la palmera cercana podría haber tenido la culpa.

Una historia de amor', la novela ganadora del Premio Planeta 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA['Vera. Una historia de amor' de Juan del Val, ganadora del Premio Planeta 2025, ha sido duramente criticada por su lenguaje pobre y falta de imaginación. En la crítica, se menciona que la 'voz directa' del autor, tan destacada en la solapa del libro, en realidad enmascara una escritura inexperta y una narrativa floja. La novela cuenta la historia de Vera, una mujer de 45 años que atraviesa una separación, y su relación con Antonio, un joven de 35 años con un pasado complicado. A lo largo de la trama, los personajes se entrelazan con los destinos de los hermanos de ambos, Alba y Diego, quienes también tienen papeles relevantes pero algo forzados. La crítica menciona la presencia de escenas eróticas y compara el enfoque del autor con una narrativa de baja categoría, como las fantasías del 'fontanero'. El final, donde el personaje de Borja se suicida tras ser revelada su maldad, se considera otro ejemplo de lo que se percibe como una falta de profundidad en la construcción de los personaj]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-negativa-de-vera-una-historia-de-amor-la-novela-ganadora-del-premio-planeta-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-negativa-de-vera-una-historia-de-amor-la-novela-ganadora-del-premio-planeta-2025</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 01:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenido en Valencia por violar a su sobrina de seis años; antecedentes de 2019 por abusos a otra menor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre de 36 años ha sido detenido en Valencia acusado de violar a su sobrina, una niña de seis años con autismo. La menor fue llevada al Hospital Clínico de Valencia por sus padres tras relatar un episodio sexual ocurrido en presencia del supuesto agresor, quien es esposo de una prima de la madre de la niña. Las pruebas médicas indicaron lesiones genitourinarias compatibles con el relato, aunque el himen permanecía intacto. La investigación, a cargo del Grupo de Menores de la Policía Nacional, llevó a que el detenido fuera puesto en libertad con una prohibición de aproximarse a menos de cien metros de la víctima. Paralelamente, se ha revelado que este mismo individuo fue arrestado en 2019 por abusos a otra menor de su entorno familiar, antecedente que quedó cancelado al ser absuelto por la defensa. La acusación particular solicita ahora la realización de una exploración de la menor mediante cámara Gesell y, por vía judicial, la toma de muestras biológicas al agresor para cotejarlas]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenido-en-valencia-por-violar-a-su-sobrina-de-seis-anos-antecedentes-de-2019-por-abusos-a-otra-menor</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenido-en-valencia-por-violar-a-su-sobrina-de-seis-anos-antecedentes-de-2019-por-abusos-a-otra-menor</guid><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 01:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La basura en las cunetas: un reflejo de nuestra falta de civismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En España, la acumulación de basura en las cunetas de las carreteras se ha convertido en un problema visible y recurrente.

Este fenómeno tiene consecuencias medioambientales graves, como la contaminación del agua, el suelo y el riesgo de incendios. Además, este comportamiento deja una mala imagen del país ante los visitantes que circulan por sus carreteras. A pesar de los esfuerzos por limpiar estos vertederos ilegales, el problema persiste, ya que muchos simplemente no respetan el entorno y continúan arrojando basura.

Durante la manifestación, la policía detuvo a tres personas, pero un vídeo mostró cómo un agente permitió que un neonazi marchara sin consecuencias, tras un comentario homófobo del policía: '¡Vamos, levanta y no seas maricón!'. Este hecho ha generado gran controversia, especialmente tras la difusión de un vídeo en el canal neonazi El Imperial, que pretendía presentar un relato victimista, pero que dejó en evidencia la falta de acción contra los grupos de extrema derecha. El incidente pone de manifiesto, una vez más, la permisividad que algunos sectores de la policía parecen tener con los grupos neonazis, mientras que en otras ocasiones se emplea una fuerza desproporcionada contra manifestaciones de izquierda.

En sus palabras, se ha referido de forma despectiva a las víctimas de la masacre, compuestas en su mayoría por mujeres, niños y ancianos, muchos de ellos residentes de Motril y otras localidades de Granada. La Asociación considera que estas declaraciones son parte de una serie de posicionamientos políticos cercanos al franquismo, que ignoran la Ley de Memoria Histórica y perpetúan la impunidad de los crímenes del franquismo.

Los primeros 500 reclutas seleccionados recibirán un salario neto de 2.000 euros mensuales durante su periodo de servicio, con expectativas de ampliar progresivamente el número de plazas para alcanzar miles de soldados en el futuro.

Según datos de la OCU, el coste de la docena de huevos más barata, que era de poco más de dos euros hace unos meses, ahora supera los tres. Además, desde 2021, los precios han subido más de un 100% tanto en huevos medianos como grandes. Esta subida afecta especialmente a las familias con menos recursos, ya que el incremento se da sobre todo en los huevos más baratos. El fenómeno, conocido como “efecto cohete y pluma”, hace que los precios suban rápidamente pero apenas bajen cuando el coste en origen disminuye. Las causas de esta subida son varias: aumento de los precios en origen, brotes de gripe aviar que han reducido la producción, resistencia de los intermediarios a bajar márgenes y cambios en la oferta de los supermercados, optando por huevos de suelo y camperos, más caros.

Sin embargo, la respuesta de la comunidad en las redes sociales no se hizo esperar. Muchos usuarios le criticaron por no tener en cuenta factores como la gripe aviar, que afecta a la producción de huevos, o el hecho de que los precios son fijados por empresas privadas. La situación se agravó cuando algunos usuarios le recordaron que el mercado ya está regulándose por sí mismo, como pretendía defender en su tuit.

La denuncia proviene de una carta enviada por la víctima al Dicasterio de Doctrina de la Fe, en la que detalla que Zornoza se introducía en su cama, lo acariciaba y besaba, además de someterle a terapias de conversión para 'curar' su homosexualidad. La víctima asegura que los abusos ocurrieron entre los 14 y 21 años y que, en varias ocasiones, Zornoza reconoció los hechos.

Se señalan rangos de precio que van desde 400 a 1.500 euros mensuales, con ejemplos en Maspalomas, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria y otros municipios. La falta de oferta acorde al sueldo medio canario, que ronda los 22.531 euros brutos anuales, ha provocado que muchos canarios deban afrontar opciones de vivienda más caras o verse fuera del mercado. Organizaciones como Derecho al Techo advierten de la explotación encubierta y la vulneración del derecho a una vivienda digna, denunciando prácticas especulativas y excluyentes, especialmente contra parejas. También se mencionan anuncios que orientan la vivienda a estudiantes, nómadas digitales y trabajadores que buscan coworking, algunos de los cuales excluyen parejas.

Tras la primera manifestación en septiembre contra estos centros, la multinacional tecnológica organizó una visita a su centro de datos en Gales para periodistas y medios seleccionados. Durante esta visita, se promovió la imagen de transparencia y sostenibilidad de los centros de datos, minimizando los impactos negativos de estos proyectos. La narrativa presentada en Gales destacaba la 'reindustrialización digital' de la ciudad de Newport, pero ocultaba los riesgos ambientales, sociales y económicos asociados. Microsoft eligió cuidadosamente los medios aragoneses para asegurar que su mensaje fuera bien recibido, tanto a nivel local como nacional, publicando artículos en los días de mayor tirada.

Además, el tribunal le ha impuesto una serie de medidas, como 40 días de localización permanente, 11 años y medio de prohibición de acercarse a los menores, y el pago de una indemnización de 12.000 euros. El tribunal considera probado que el acusado ejerció violencia física y psicológica sobre los menores a través de agresiones, insultos y conductas vejatorias. Además, el hogar donde los niños residían con su padre carecía de las condiciones mínimas de higiene y seguridad, lo que provocó que los menores estuvieran infestados de pulgas. El padre tampoco proporcionaba la medicación necesaria a su hijo ni una alimentación adecuada. Los informes psicológicos y testimonios de los menores acreditan el sufrimiento emocional sufrido.

El artículo recopila referencias que van desde la época de la caída de los zares y el inicio de la revolución bolchevique hasta las dinámicas de la posguerra y la Guerra Fría, pasando por la era contemporánea de la OTAN y la UE. Se afirma que los intereses corporativos y estatales habrían promovido un mapa euroasiático que favorece la desestabilización de Rusia, y que la élite occidental habría utilizado instrumentos como sanciones, apoyo a conflictos regionales y campañas mediáticas para justificar una presencia militar prolongada.

Las agencias anticorrupción ucranianas, NABU y SAPO, han hecho públicos audios en los que altos funcionarios del gobierno, de Energoatom y otros organismos exigen sobornos de hasta el 15% para adjudicar contratos públicos. Además, se ha descubierto una posible sobreestimación en la compra de materiales técnicos por valor de tres veces el precio real. El empresario Timur Mindich, amigo cercano de Zelenski y socio en la productora Kvartal 95, ha sido señalado como un intermediario clave en esta red de corrupción.

El inmueble, que en el pasado fue una fortaleza árabe, un cuartel de la Guardia Civil y una residencia temporal de la Reina Isabel la Católica, será transformado en un hotel rural de cuatro estrellas por un grupo empresarial canario. A pesar de que se había planteado en su momento su uso como museo, la falta de consenso y el coste elevado de la rehabilitación han impedido que se materialice el proyecto.

Los 10 procesadores más vendidos en la plataforma son todos de AMD, con modelos como Ryzen 7 7800X3D y Ryzen 9 9950X3D liderando las ventas. Intel sólo aparece en el puesto 16 con su Core i9-14900K, seguido de otros dos modelos en posiciones inferiores, lo que indica una fuerte caída en su presencia de mercado. Este fenómeno refleja un cambio importante en el sector, donde AMD consolida su liderazgo gracias a sus plataformas AM4 y AM5, además de expandir su beneficio a 14 millones de dólares, quintuplicando las ventas de Intel, que alcanza sólo 3,15 millones. A pesar de los retos en producción, Intel apostó por su I+D y fabricación propia, pero el respaldo de TSMC a AMD, junto con precios medios más competitivos, han favorecido la expansión de AMD.

A pesar de esta información, Mazón continuó su comida hasta las 18:45 horas. A las 18:16, Pradas le mostró su preocupación por el riesgo de colapso de la presa de Forata, pero no fue hasta las 19:43 que Mazón contactó con ella para coordinar una respuesta. La tragedia, que ya había cobrado vidas a las 17:00 horas, dejó 229 muertos en Valencia tras el desbordamiento del río Magro. Los informes indican que a las 18:16, ya habían fallecido 25 personas y el número subió a 60 antes de las 19:00.

A medida que la vivienda se ha convertido en una inversión financiera, el coste de vivir se ha disparado, lo que ha dificultado la formación de familias. Este fenómeno afecta a jóvenes de todo el mundo, que destinan una parte significativa de sus ingresos al alquiler o la compra de viviendas, dejando menos recursos para la crianza de hijos. Investigaciones realizadas en países como China, Brasil, Japón y Australia demuestran que la inseguridad y la falta de accesibilidad a la vivienda contribuyen a la baja tasa de natalidad. La solución pasaría por tratar la vivienda como un bien social y no como un activo financiero, para asegurar que las personas puedan formar y mantener familias sin las presiones económicas actuales.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-mercantilizacion-de-la-vivienda-en-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-fertilidad-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-de-la-mercantilizacion-de-la-vivienda-en-la-caida-de-la-tasa-de-fertilidad-global</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 17:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump otorga indultos a Giuliani y otros implicados en los intentos de anular las elecciones de 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[Donald Trump ha concedido un perdón simbólico y preventivo a 77 personas vinculadas a sus esfuerzos por revertir los resultados de las elecciones presidenciales de 2020. Entre los indultados se encuentran figuras clave de su círculo cercano, como Rudy Giuliani, quien fue su abogado y exalcalde de Nueva York, así como otros aliados como Sidney Powell y John Eastman. El perdón, anunciado por Ed Martin, abogado de la Casa Blanca, no tiene impacto legal, ya que los implicados no enfrentan cargos federales. La medida se enmarca dentro de la estrategia de Trump para reescribir el relato del asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, y se interpreta como un ajuste de cuentas político, dado que ha utilizado el indulto para premiar a colaboradores cercanos y continuar con su narrativa de que las elecciones fueron fraudulentas, a pesar de la evidencia contraria.

La investigación, iniciada el 7 de octubre por la Unidad de Policía Nacional Adscrita a la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía, culminó con la detención de la madre y su pareja. A raíz de los hechos, el niño fue retirado de su entorno familiar y se dictó su desamparo provisional.

A pesar de las explicaciones de la Diputación de Valencia, que asegura que se cumplen los descansos anuales, los sindicatos critican que el uso de horas extras vulnera la normativa que limita el 10% del presupuesto para este fin, llegando al 30% en los últimos años.

Estas ofertas secretas, accesibles a través de 'amagos' de portabilidad o mediante procesos de retención, ofrecen descuentos significativos en comparación con los precios oficiales. Vodafone y Lowi han liderado esta estrategia con tarifas que pueden ser hasta un 30% más baratas que las de Digi, además de ofrecer condiciones más favorables a largo plazo, como la permanencia indefinida.

HKG, que es copropiedad de RWE y varias empresas municipales, había solicitado al gobierno alemán 350 millones de euros para cubrir estos gastos, pero un tribunal rechazó su demanda en junio de 2025. La planta, en funcionamiento solo tres años antes de ser retirada en 1989, fue un prototipo experimental que no alcanzó sus objetivos. Ahora, los costos estimados para el desmantelamiento se calculan entre 750 millones y 1.000 millones de euros, lo que podría generar una carga financiera para el Estado alemán. Este caso pone de manifiesto la creciente preocupación sobre cómo afrontar el desmantelamiento de plantas nucleares en el marco de la transición energética en Alemania, especialmente tras el cierre definitivo de sus reactores en 2023.

Según la noticia, el Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS) habría denegado durante meses la realización de nuevas pruebas a una mujer con un bulto en el pecho, obligándola a acudir repetidamente a Urgencias del Hospital Reina Sofía para exigir una biopsia. Este caso se enmarca en una polémica mayor sobre el cribado y el acceso a pruebas diagnósticas en la sanidad pública, con FACUA exhortando a las autoridades a tomar medidas para evitar retrasos que puedan afectar a la detección temprana y al tratamiento de las pacientes. La noticia también señala que ya hay 84 mujeres que forman parte de la plataforma de afectadas, lo que subraya la magnitud de la cuestión y la urgencia de investigar y esclarecer responsabilidades.

La propuesta surge en un contexto de dificultad de acceso a la vivienda, con datos que señalan un aumento significativo en el coste de la hipoteca durante la última década. El objetivo declarado es desincentivar la concentración de vivienda en manos de grandes tenedores y fomentar el alquiler social y la vivienda habitual. El impuesto beginning con un 4% para la tercera vivienda, escalando al 8% desde la cuarta y al 12% desde la quinta, con aumentos subsecuentes de 5 puntos porcentuales por cada vivienda adicional. Además, ERC propone eliminar los beneficios fiscales de las SOCIMIS y aplicar un IVA del 21% a las viviendas turísticas, medidas que buscan reducir la especulación y ampliar el acceso a vivienda estable.

Entre los beneficiarios del indulto se encuentran figuras destacadas como el abogado personal de Trump, Rudy Giuliani, la abogada Sidney Powell y el exjefe de gabinete Mark Meadows. Según el abogado encargado de los indultos, Ed Martin, el perdón incluye una 'exoneración total, completa e incondicional' para estas personas, quienes enfrentaban cargos relacionados con la tentativa de subvertir el resultado electoral. El perdón se aplica solo a los cargos federales, no a los estatales, y no cubre al propio Trump.

De los 680 millones de euros asignados para el Mecanismo de Recuperación y Resiliencia (MRR), la región ha ejecutado solo un 3% del presupuesto, lo que se traduce en un número de viviendas considerablemente inferior a lo prometido. De las 992 viviendas inicialmente previstas, solo 358 se construirán en el plazo estipulado, y varios lotes han sido excluidos de la financiación. El gobierno regional justifica su incapacidad para cumplir con los plazos y las promesas iniciales, aunque los fondos no ejecutados se destinarán a los municipios para que sean ellos los encargados de gestionarlos.

Aunque no se ha detallado el nivel exacto de alcohol, este hecho se suma a las quejas vecinales sobre la velocidad con la que el torero circulaba por la zona.

En su análisis, subraya que el franquismo no fue un tiempo de 'placidez extraordinaria' como defienden ciertos sectores, sino un régimen totalitario caracterizado por la represión y la falta de libertades. La investigación histórica reciente ha permitido comprender mejor este período y desmontar los mitos sobre su supuesto bienestar económico. Hernández también aborda cómo la educación deficiente, las redes sociales y el auge de la extrema derecha contribuyen a la difusión de estos bulos, especialmente entre los más jóvenes.

Aunque Bonilla aseguró que el problema estaba resuelto 'al 80%', miles de personas se manifestaron en defensa de la sanidad pública, denunciando la negligencia y la falta de transparencia en el sistema. La crisis de los cribados surgió cuando se descubrió que muchas personas, algunas incluso con diagnóstico tardío de cáncer, no fueron citadas a tiempo.

La presidenta de la Asociación de Víctimas Mortales Dana 29-O, Rosa Álvarez, reclamó que Mazón dejara su acta de diputado y se presentara ante la justicia. Los manifestantes, que corearon consignas como 'Mazón a presó' y 'No són morts, són assassinats', también denunciaron la falta de respuesta del Consell ante la tragedia, exigiendo la reconstrucción de los colegios e institutos afectados. La protesta, aunque no fue partidista, se centró en la responsabilidad de los líderes del gobierno autonómico, a quienes se acusó de abandonar a las víctimas en su momento de mayor necesidad.

El acuerdo permitirá la reapertura del gobierno sin garantías de que se prorroguen las ayudas sanitarias bajo la Ley de Cuidado de la Salud Asequible (Obamacare). A pesar de la oposición de varios líderes demócratas, que exigen una extensión de estas ayudas, Trump sigue sin ofrecer una alternativa clara al sistema de Obamacare. El acuerdo, respaldado por algunos demócratas moderados, también incluye medidas para la protección de empleados federales y la financiación de programas clave, como la ayuda alimentaria y los veteranos. Sin embargo, la batalla sobre los subsidios sanitarios continuará y el resultado final sigue siendo incierto, lo que genera tensiones dentro del partido demócrata.

Lo relevante no es solo la atrocidad cometida, sino cómo la reacción pública se ha centrado en condenar la filtración y no el crimen. La protagonista, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, máxima autoridad jurídica militar de Israel, fue suspendida y después dimitió tras admitir ser autora de la filtración. La noticia resalta dos reacciones principales en la opinión israelí: la derecha considera que el caso es una maniobra de conspiración del 'Estado profundo' para atacar los valores nacionales, mientras que el sector liberal justifica la filtración como un acto por la justicia y el Estado de derecho, obviando la cuestión del genocidio en Gaza.

Utilizando 500 vapeadores desechables que rescató de la basura, construyó una batería casera capaz de alimentar su hogar y taller. Los vapeadores, comúnmente desechados al agotarse, contienen baterías internas que aún conservan capacidad, lo que llevó a Doel a probar su reutilización. Recogió los dispositivos en tiendas locales, desarmándolos y seleccionando las baterías con mejor rendimiento. Tras organizarlas en módulos y usar tecnología reciclada de otros dispositivos, logró crear una batería de 2,52 kWh y 40 kilos de peso. La batería fue configurada para proporcionar 230 voltios de corriente alterna, alimentando su taller y parte de su vivienda. Doel planea instalar paneles solares para hacer su sistema completamente autosuficiente. Este proyecto destaca no solo por su creatividad, sino también por su enfoque en la sostenibilidad y el reciclaje de dispositivos electrónicos.

Este ataque no fue solo un desvío de la seguridad pública, sino una acción con un marcado componente político, diseñada para interrumpir la recuperación de prestigio internacional del país bajo el liderazgo de Lula. La reacción internacional ante la masacre también afecta la imagen de Brasil, justo antes de la COP 30, un evento clave para la diplomacia brasileña.

Este análisis, realizado a partir del trabajo del filólogo judío alemán Victor Klemperer, explora cómo el lenguaje ha sido utilizado históricamente para manipular y polarizar a la sociedad. Gaupp y Labrador, en su artículo de 2020, muestran cómo este lenguaje busca construir un relato en el que los 'otros' son demonizados y la nación se presenta como amenazada. Durante el debate, al que asistieron más de 200 personas, se discutieron los orígenes y los factores que favorecen la aceptación de estos discursos, así como las tácticas de resistencia que pueden contrarrestar el impacto de esta retórica.

El dinero, que debía utilizarse para el bienestar de los sacerdotes, fue presuntamente desviado por el fraile y un cómplice hacia cuentas bancarias en Colombia y Argentina. La investigación comenzó a raíz de varias denuncias de familiares de los sacerdotes afectados, quienes alertaron sobre la presunta estafa, en la que las víctimas, debido a su edad y estado de salud, no eran conscientes de la desviación de fondos. Las autoridades descubrieron que uno de los implicados tenía acceso a las cuentas bancarias de los residentes y habría transferido diversas cantidades de dinero a través de locutorios a países extranjeros. La acusación sugiere que, al menos, tres sacerdotes fueron víctimas del fraude.

En una entrevista con El País, Alaqad reflexiona sobre la deshumanización de las víctimas, la culpa del superviviente y la imposibilidad de planificar cuando la violencia y la ocupación condicionan cada aspecto de la vida cotidiana. Afirma que el alto el fuego es simplemente un intervalo entre tragedias y critica que el mundo trate el conflicto como una “guerra” en lugar de reconocerlo como un genocidio.

A pesar de la baja participación electoral (38%), Mamdani logró un apoyo mayoritario entre los inmigrantes y jóvenes de la ciudad. Esta victoria plantea retos tanto para Donald Trump como para los demócratas. Trump enfrenta el descontento de su base por la falta de avances en sus promesas económicas, como la reducción de la inflación y la mejora de las condiciones laborales. Además, el auge del socialismo urbano y la insatisfacción de la generación Z con el capitalismo podrían alterar el panorama político.

Aunque la Guardia Civil confirmó el tráfico de la menor, la joven negó haber sido forzada a casarse ni a mendigar, lo que llevó a la justicia a cerrar el caso sin consecuencias para los implicados. Los padres biológicos, así como los suegros de la niña y el joven con quien fue casada, permanecen en libertad.

A pesar de que el equipo de geógrafos de la Universidad de León monitoreó su retroceso desde 2004, en octubre de 2025 se constató que casi todo el hielo había desaparecido, dejando solo un pequeño vestigio de lo que fue una gran masa de hielo. El Trasllambrión alimentó a la cordillera durante siglos, pero el cambio climático ha acelerado su desaparición. En su momento, este glaciar llegó a cubrir una superficie de 10 hectáreas, pero ya en los años 90 comenzó a reducirse.

Este cambio se debe en gran parte a la creciente participación de las mujeres en el mercado laboral, quienes han impulsado una transformación en los modelos de trabajo. A lo largo de las últimas décadas, las mujeres comenzaron a ocupar empleos a tiempo parcial, lo que permitió reconfigurar las estructuras familiares y laborales. Hoy en día, el modelo laboral en los Países Bajos favorece la conciliación de la vida personal y profesional, contribuyendo a una tasa de desempleo baja. Este sistema flexible no solo beneficia a los padres que se encargan del cuidado de sus hijos, sino que también ha permitido a muchas personas seguir activas en la fuerza laboral.

El especial incluye más de 1.500 materiales, la mitad fotografías cedidas por familiares, asociaciones memorialistas y agencias, y la otra mitad vídeos, muchos de ellos inéditos y procedentes del Archivo de RTVE. Entre los contenidos destacan homenajes a figuras como Primo de Rivera y a víctimas de la represión republicana, así como noticias y emisiones de RNE. El mapa permite acercar al público actual a las vivencias de las víctimas, sus familiares y testigos, mostrando tanto el trabajo de exhumación como los restos descubiertos tras años bajo tierra.

Los participantes exigían la expulsión de los migrantes y abogaban por una Europa exclusivamente cristiana. Durante la marcha, se produjeron disturbios que incluyeron el quemado de contenedores y la destrucción de mobiliario público, además de enfrentamientos con los agentes. Tras la intervención de la Policía, que utilizó porras y disparos disuasorios, los manifestantes se dispersaron por el barrio de Las Letras, dejando a su paso daños materiales. Los organizadores de la marcha intentaron evitar que los participantes mantuvieran símbolos ultras y anunciaron el fin de la protesta.

En un vídeo difundido a través de su Facebook, Romero aclaró que no tenía intención de criticar a los profesionales de la salud, sino que sus palabras fueron mal interpretadas. Esta controversia surgió después de que, durante un debate en Antena Huelva, Romero responsabilizara a los equipos médicos por no contactar a las 2.317 mujeres afectadas por los fallos en el cribado. Las reacciones no se hicieron esperar, con fuertes críticas desde los sindicatos de médicos y el Consejo Andaluz de Colegios de Médicos, que exigieron una rectificación pública.

Un análisis de homologaciones revela que 27 fabricantes gestionan la gran mayoría de modelos, con una presencia internacional marcada: solo 7 empresas españolas participan en la fabricación, frente a 19 con sede en el exterior. Este desequilibrio se acentúa al mirar las homologaciones: apenas 29 de las 233 balizas listadas son fabricadas exclusivamente en España, representando el 12% del total. El fabricante más prolífico es Ningbo Chakesi Electronic Co., Ltd. (China), cuyo principal cliente Limburg Technology Limited registró 78 homologaciones, y sus modelos aparecen bajo numerosas marcas.

La investigación, llevada a cabo por la Unidad Central de Falsificación de Moneda de la DIC, reveló que los billetes falsificados procedían directamente de la Camorra italiana y presentaban un alto grado de calidad, lo que dificultaba su detección. El operativo, realizado el 5 de noviembre, reunió a efectivos del Área Central de Crimen Organizado de la DIC y del ARRO de la Región Policial Metropolitana Norte, y resultó en la detención de siete sospechosos (cuatro mujeres y tres hombres) que habían privilegiado esta modalidad de fraude operando desde viviendas múltiples en el mismo barrio.

Además, el informe destacó acusaciones sobre un sesgo propalestino en la división en árabe y la retirada de un documental con vínculos a un familiar de un líder de Hamás, así como críticas sobre cómo se tratan los derechos trans, atribuyendo la línea editorial a un pequeño grupo dentro del personal.

Este estilo, que encontró su máxima expresión en la arquitectura, la moda y el diseño de interiores, representa una fusión entre lo tradicional y lo moderno, lo artesanal y lo tecnológico. La Exposición Internacional de Artes Decorativas de 1925 en París dio nombre a este movimiento, que rápidamente se extendió por el mundo, desde los rascacielos de Nueva York hasta los edificios más emblemáticos de Miami Beach. Sus principales características incluyen formas geométricas, simetría elegante y materiales lujosos como el mármol, ónix y acero inoxidable, a la par que elementos inspirados en civilizaciones antiguas. El Art Deco también influenció el diseño de objetos cotidianos, como radios, lámparas y vehículos, fusionando la funcionalidad con la estética.

Mientras algunos defensores del expresidente la consideran una solución para facilitar la compra de vivienda, muchos analistas y políticos han calificado la idea como 'espectacularmente tonta'. La propuesta, que busca alargar el plazo de las hipotecas actuales a 50 años, podría resultar en un aumento significativo de los intereses a pagar a lo largo de la vida de los prestatarios. Por ejemplo, una casa de 400.000 dólares bajo una hipoteca a 30 años se pagaría a un total de 863.000 dólares, mientras que bajo la propuesta de Trump ese monto se elevaría a 1,38 millones de dólares. Expertos como Mike Nellis y el inversor Alex Cole consideran que esta medida podría enriquecer a los bancos y dejar a los ciudadanos atrapados en deudas durante toda su vida.

El hallazgo más relevante es que el Hemisferio Norte se oscurece más rápido que el Sur, absorbiendo aproximadamente 0.34 vatios más por metro cuadrado y por década. Este desbalance se debe a tres factores principales: el deshielo que expone superficies más oscuras, la reducción de aerosoles en la atmósfera por regulaciones ambientales que disminuye la reflexión de la luz, y el aumento de vapor de agua en el Norte debido al mayor calentamiento. Aunque la cobertura de nubes no ha mostrado cambios significativos en las últimas dos décadas, los investigadores señalan que podría haber incertidumbres sobre su comportamiento futuro.

El proceso de denaturalización, que podría retirarle la ciudadanía, es extremadamente raro y solo procede con pruebas claras y contundentes de fraude.

La conversación fluye entre los asistentes de la taberna, que se muestran cada vez más desconcertados ante las profundas y abstractas reflexiones sobre el infinito y los subconjuntos de los números reales. A través de esta narrativa, Carlo Frabetti invita a reflexionar sobre la complejidad matemática y teológica de las relaciones interpersonales y los límites del entendimiento humano. La historia también plantea cuestiones sobre la transfinidad y la posibilidad de relaciones divinas más allá de los binomios tradicionales, ampliando la visión del amor y la creación infinita.

Además, criticó a los republicanos por no hablar adecuadamente sobre la 'asequibilidad' y acusó a los demócratas de mentir sobre este tema.

A pesar de los esfuerzos de los palestinos por regresar a sus tierras, la violencia y las restricciones impuestas por el ejército israelí continúan dificultando su acceso.

Tomer-Yerushalmi, quien se encontraba bajo arresto domiciliario desde el 7 de noviembre de 2025, está acusada de filtrar un vídeo que muestra a carceleros israelíes abusando de un prisionero palestino en la prisión de Sde Teiman, en el desierto del Néguev, en 2024. En el vídeo, se ve a los carceleros cometiendo abusos físicos, incluidos golpes y uso de un taser. A pesar de su ingreso en el hospital, la exabogada fue hallada consciente y su vida no corre peligro. Su detención se produjo tras su confesión de haber filtrado el vídeo al canal de noticias israelí Canal 12. El caso ha generado una gran polémica, con reacciones tanto de apoyo como de condena hacia Tomer-Yerushalmi, y ha desencadenado protestas en Israel en torno a la filtración y las acusaciones de abuso por parte de las fuerzas de seguridad israe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exabogada-israeli-ingresada-en-hospital-tras-presunta-sobredosis-mientras-esta-bajo-arresto-domiciliario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exabogada-israeli-ingresada-en-hospital-tras-presunta-sobredosis-mientras-esta-bajo-arresto-domiciliario</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 21:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exhumados los restos de 138 víctimas de la represión franquista en Riotinto]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los trabajos de exhumación realizados en el cementerio de Santa Bárbara de Minas de Riotinto, en Huelva, han permitido descubrir los restos de 138 personas que fueron víctimas de la represión franquista. De estos, 22 fueron encontrados en las últimas dos fosas comunes, que se suman a los 116 recuperados anteriormente. Los restos hallados presentan evidencias de violencia extrema, como fracturas perimortem, proyectiles de armas largas y cortas, y alambres, lo que confirma la brutalidad sufrida por las víctimas. El Ayuntamiento de Riotinto ha subrayado la importancia de continuar con el proceso de identificación y exhumación, para asegurar que estas personas y sus familias obtengan reparación y justicia. La provincia de Huelva ha sido escenario de numerosas exhumaciones en los últimos años, respaldadas por el I Plan Cuatrienal de Exhumaciones 2020-2024, financiadas por el Ministerio de la Presidencia.

La sentencia, emitida en septiembre de 2025, anula una sanción de 200 euros que la Dirección General de Tráfico había impuesto a un conductor cuyo coche permanecía estacionado en la calle, sin que estuviese en circulación. Según el fallo, la ley sanciona únicamente la circulación de vehículos sin la ITV vigente, no el mero hecho de estar aparcado. El juez destaca que la infracción requiere que el vehículo esté en movimiento, ya que el núcleo de la norma está en el verbo 'circular'. Hasta ahora, tanto la DGT como algunos tribunales interpretaban que era sancionable cualquier vehículo con la ITV caducada, incluso sin estar circulando. Sin embargo, el magistrado reconoce una 'reconsideración' respecto a resoluciones anteriores y subraya que multar a un coche parado por ese motivo no previene ningún riesgo para la seguridad vial.

Traoré criticó las recientes amenazas de Donald Trump de intervenir militarmente en Nigeria, bajo el pretexto de combatir a grupos terroristas como Daesh y Boko Haram. Según el líder burkinés, estos grupos extremistas son financiados y entrenados por países imperialistas para desestabilizar la región africana y robar sus recursos naturales. Traoré aseveró que el objetivo de estas potencias es mantener a África en un estado de guerra permanente, lo que impide su desarrollo y perpetúa la explotación de sus riquezas.

A pesar de las estrictas medidas de seguridad, muchos berlineses idearon formas de cruzar la frontera, siendo los túneles una de las soluciones más arriesgadas y a la vez exitosas. El primer túnel se excavó solo un mes después de la construcción del muro, en una historia que tiene tintes románticos, ya que un par de jóvenes excavan un túnel para sacar a sus novias. Con el paso de los años, la construcción de túneles se convirtió en una de las formas más utilizadas para escapar del régimen comunista, siendo responsables de la fuga de cientos de personas. Sin embargo, no todos los túneles tuvieron éxito. Muchos fueron descubiertos antes de que las personas pudieran escapar, y otros se derrumbaron antes de ser terminados.

La misión será pionera, ya que nunca antes se ha llevado a cabo un proyecto de estas características, que implicará el acoplamiento de varios elementos en órbita antes de iniciar el viaje hacia Saturno. El lanzamiento se prevé entre 2042 y 2046, con una llegada a Encélado entre 2053 y 2057. La sonda estará compuesta por un orbitador y un aterrizador que explorarán la luna en detalle.

La noticia sugiere que la firma de inversiones busca reorientar su portfolio hacia oportunidades potencialmente menos volátiles o con mayores perspectivas de liquidez. A nivel de mercado, este movimiento podría influir en los precios de activos similares y en la percepción de inversores sobre el riesgo asociado a plataformas de vivienda asistida y comunidades para adultos mayores.

A través de una narrativa fragmentada y no lineal, la autora construye un relato que transita entre los años 1970 y 2010, donde lo que se transmite no son relatos, sino silencios que atraviesan a los personajes. La novela se centra en la relación entre Stella y Emma, madre e hija, quienes cargan con secretos y emociones reprimidas que marcan su destino. Los silencios entre ellas y las promesas incumplidas —como el viaje al Pacífico que nunca se realiza— sirven como metáforas de lo no dicho y lo no vivido. El mar, que da título a la obra, se convierte en un símbolo de lo inalcanzable, de las promesas rotas y de la violencia latente.

El autor plantea que Narciso no se limita a ser un joven hermosísimo que se queda ciego ante el mundo, sino que es testigo de un amor que nace al mirarse en el agua: un amor dirigido hacia su propia imagen que, paradójicamente, señala la vulnerabilidad y la necesidad de conexión con otros. Eco, por su parte, representa la fidelidad a un deseo que se desdibuja cuando la voz del otro se repite hasta la perfección repetitiva, mostrando una condena divina por negarse a amar. A lo largo del texto se exploran lecturas críticas desde la mitología clásica hasta Lacan y Dalí, pasando por Ovidio y las interpretaciones psicoanalíticas modernas, para sostener que el verdadero pecado reside en la negación del amor hacia los demás o hacia uno mismo.

La cobertura señala que, mientras desde Congreso se ha presionado al PP y a Vox para escuchar a las víctimas y recoger sus testimonios, en las Cortes y el Senado el PP trata de desviar la responsabilidad hacia el Gobierno central, citando a ministros y a Pedro Sánchez sin convocar a consellers. Se mencionan comparecencias y citaciones, incluyendo la posible participación de Carlos Mazón, presidente del PP valenciano, y la ausencia de respuestas por parte del Gobierno ante las comisiones autonómicas. Expertos consultados destacan que la incidencia de factores como las cañas en el barranco del Poyo fue nula y que existen sensores suficientes para monitorizar crecidas.

Si se realiza solo una transferencia bancaria sin seguir los procedimientos fiscales correctos, la Agencia Tributaria podría considerarlo una donación encubierta. En este caso, los padres se enfrentarían a sanciones de entre 7.000 y 9.000 euros, además de recargos e intereses. Los expertos aconsejan que para evitar estos problemas se formalice un préstamo o donación ante notario y se declare en el plazo correspondiente, utilizando el modelo 600. La diferencia entre préstamo y donación es clave, ya que mientras que el préstamo debe ser devuelto, la donación está sujeta a impuestos de sucesiones y donaciones. Si se opta por la donación y se hace de forma correcta, se pueden aplicar beneficios fiscales. En cambio, si solo se hace la transferencia sin declaración alguna, Hacienda puede imponer una sanción. La recomendación es firmar la escritura de donación]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hacienda-alerta-sobre-multas-por-ayudar-a-los-hijos-con-la-compra-de-vivienda-sin-declarar-correctamente-como-prestamo-o-donacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hacienda-alerta-sobre-multas-por-ayudar-a-los-hijos-con-la-compra-de-vivienda-sin-declarar-correctamente-como-prestamo-o-donacion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 15:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Venezuela amplía su cooperación militar con Rusia ante tensiones con EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe un incremento en la cooperación militar entre Venezuela y Rusia, con la llegada de sistemas de defensa aérea Pantsir F-1 y Buk-M2E, además de la posibilidad de suministros de misiles balísticos hipersónicos Oréshnik y misiles de crucero Kalibr.

Los flujos piroclásticos que descendieron por las laderas del volcán formaron ríos de lava y escombros que arrasaron con la ciudad de Armero, situada a sus pies. La mayoría de los 20.000 habitantes que residían allí quedaron sepultados por la avalancha de lodo y rocas. Entre las imágenes más recordadas de esa tragedia está la de Omayra Sánchez, una niña de 13 años que, atrapada bajo los escombros, pidió ayuda en sus últimos momentos, pronunciando la desgarradora frase: 'Mamá, reza para que esta gente me ayude a salir'.

Además, destaca una interesante particularidad: 'Si plantas un hueso de aceituna, no saldrá un olivo, sino un acebuche, la planta silvestre ancestral'. Para cultivar un olivo verdadero, es necesario usar varas de olivo, no huesos de aceituna, ya que los olivos actuales son descendientes de injertos milenarios.

El descubrimiento de un gran edificio absidal en la fortaleza, destinado a funciones de representación y recepción, parece ser el lugar donde ocurrió este evento trágico. Este hallazgo ha permitido resolver parte de un misterio histórico que llevaba siglos sin esclarecerse, y también arroja luz sobre los acontecimientos que llevaron a la proclamación de su hijo, Valentiniano II, como emperador poco después de su muerte.

Sin embargo, la historia judicial del caso muestra una serie de irregularidades, archivadas investigaciones y regularizaciones fiscales que lo exoneraron de responsabilidades penales. En 2008, Juan Carlos I aceptó un regalo millonario del rey saudí Abdalá bin Abdulaziz y lo ocultó en bancos suizos a través de una fundación en Panamá, evitando pagar impuestos en España.

En la investigación, iniciada tras incautaciones de mochilas con cocaína en 2022 y 2023, se identificó una estructura logística internacional que coordinaba la entrada de droga desde aeropuertos extranjeros y su salida de la zona de aduanas con identidades de viajeros falsos.

Las viviendas se encontraban en un antiguo almacén y estaban destinadas principalmente a inmigrantes, incluyendo algunas familias con menores. Esta investigación se produce en el marco de un esfuerzo por frenar el abuso en el mercado inmobiliario, que ha visto el auge de alquileres en condiciones insalubres aprovechando la crisis de vivienda. Tras el desmantelamiento de las infraviviendas en octubre de 2024, el Ayuntamiento de Badalona ha decidido emprender acciones contra las empresas responsables, que podrían enfrentar sanciones millonarias. La Fiscalía ha remitido el caso a la Agencia de Vivienda de Cataluña para evaluar si se deben imponer sanciones a la empresa que gestionaba los alquileres, mientras que la situación refleja una creciente preocupación por el aumento de viviendas ilega]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-examina-el-alquiler-ilegal-de-infraviviendas-de-15-m-en-badalona-por-450-euros-al-mes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-examina-el-alquiler-ilegal-de-infraviviendas-de-15-m-en-badalona-por-450-euros-al-mes</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 11:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moreno se sobrepone a la crisis de los cribados y lanza un mensaje de confianza al PP andaluz]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de la Junta de Andalucía, Juanma Moreno, ha cerrado el XVII Congreso del PP andaluz en Sevilla destacando que la crisis generada por los errores en los cribados de cáncer de mama está superada. A pesar de las críticas recibidas, Moreno defendió con firmeza la gestión de su Gobierno en el ámbito sanitario, destacando el incremento en la inversión y la mejora de los equipos oncológicos. Durante su discurso, pidió a los militantes del PP que defiendan su gestión 'sin complejos', rechazando las acusaciones de privatización y asegurando que el Partido Popular es el que más ha hecho por la sanidad pública en la historia de Andalucía. Este Congreso, que tiene como objetivo la revalidación de la mayoría absoluta en las elecciones de 2026, también ha sido una oportunidad para recalcar la importancia de la estabilidad política y evitar depender de Vox, como ocurre en otras comunidades autónomas.

Nick Daniels, presidente de la Asociación Nacional de Controladores Aéreos, reveló que muchos están renunciando diariamente, lo que agrava la escasez de personal en los aeropuertos. A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno por reducir el tráfico aéreo en las principales ciudades para mitigar el caos, el impacto sobre la seguridad y la eficiencia del sistema de aviación está creciendo. Los controladores que siguen trabajando están siendo sometidos a turnos excesivos, lo que genera un nivel alarmante de fatiga.

A partir de datos SIPRI y estudios académicos de Estados Unidos y Europa, se contrasta el gasto militar con inversiones en educación, sanidad y medio ambiente. Se detallan proyecciones de la propuesta Rearm Europe y su posible impacto en el PIB y el gasto militar de la UE para 2035, incluyendo estimaciones de empleo por sector. Los hallazgos señalan que, si bien el gasto militar genera empleo, lo hace en menor medida que otros sectores sociales, especialmente educación y salud. En España, los estudios citados indican que invertir en educación, salud y medio ambiente produce entre dos y tres veces más puestos de trabajo que invertir en defensa. Además, se subraya que una parte relevante del gasto en rearme podría dirigirse a importaciones, reduciendo el efecto positivo en la economía local y potencialmente favoreciendo a mercados extran]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gasto-en-defensa-y-su-impacto-real-en-el-empleo-en-la-ue-mito-o-realidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gasto-en-defensa-y-su-impacto-real-en-el-empleo-en-la-ue-mito-o-realidad</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La FEDE advierte sobre los peligros de los glucómetros no invasivos no aprobados]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Federación Española de Diabetes (FEDE) ha emitido una alerta sobre los riesgos asociados con los glucómetros no invasivos que se están promoviendo en Internet y otros medios.

El texto compara la burocracia académica con un sistema cerrado que prioriza la forma sobre la sustancia, dificultando la promoción de la excelencia y la incorporación de voces relevantes en áreas como la traducción literaria y las lenguas extranjeras. Se destacan tres mecanismos del poder departamental: la configuración de plazas a medida, el reparto de docencia favoreciendo redes internas y la interpretación de méritos que puede favorecer publicaciones autofinanciadas o posicionamientos en rankings por encima de la calidad real de la docencia y la investigación.

Se observa un incremento en el número de anisákidos en las poblaciones de salmón rosado y chum con el paso de las décadas, mientras que se mantiene estable en otras especies.

Almudena Quintana, directora general de asistencia sanitaria, ha subrayado que el objetivo era evitar más confusión entre los pacientes, por lo que no se enviaron nuevas cartas, sino que se optó por los SMS como medio de comunicación más directo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comunidad-de-madrid-informa-sobre-el-error-en-las-notificaciones-de-cancer-de-colon-y-los-pasos-para-corregirlo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comunidad-de-madrid-informa-sobre-el-error-en-las-notificaciones-de-cancer-de-colon-y-los-pasos-para-corregirlo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 00:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Muertos y heridos en Tenerife por golpes de mar durante alerta costera]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este sábado, tres personas han fallecido y otras 15 han resultado heridas en Tenerife debido a golpes de mar, en una jornada en la que las Islas Canarias se encuentran en prealerta por fenómenos costeros. El primer incidente tuvo lugar en la playa del Roque de Las Bodegas, donde seis turistas franceses fueron arrastrados por las olas. Cuatro de ellos fueron hospitalizados. En la playa de El Cabezo, en el sur de la isla, un hombre falleció tras ser encontrado en parada cardiorrespiratoria. Más tarde, un golpe de mar en el muelle de Puerto de la Cruz, al norte de Tenerife, arrastró a varias personas al agua, entre ellas una mujer que también perdió la vida. Otras tres personas resultaron gravemente heridas y fueron trasladadas a hospitales.

Según el Ministerio del Interior de Yemen, la operación de desmantelamiento fue exitosa gracias a un proceso de investigación y vigilancia que permitió descubrir los métodos operativos de los agentes involucrados. Los espías operaban desde Arabia Saudí y estaban equipados con dispositivos avanzados para monitorear infraestructuras clave, incluidos sitios militares y de seguridad. La red buscaba recabar información sobre las fuerzas armadas yemeníes, en especial en relación a los misiles y drones empleados en ataques contra Israel.

Este acto se suma a una historia de décadas de prácticas similares y de afirmaciones de que se trata de una tradición. El municipio, con 2.200 habitantes, vio a Vox convertirse en la formación más votada en las elecciones locales; García Avilés obtuvo la mayoría absoluta con el 49,16% de los votos y seis de los once ediles. El Ayuntamiento se desvincula formalmente del calendario, aunque el regidor reconoció haber tenido una estatua de Franco en su despacho y defendió que el negocio es independiente. Las imágenes han generado críticas políticas, con acusaciones de connivencia y llamados a recordar la memoria democrática.

El convoy formaba parte de una misión humanitaria y, a pesar de la gravedad del ataque, los ocupantes del vehículo lograron salvar sus vidas por poco. El dron, de tipo Orion y conocido por su capacidad para realizar ataques precisos, impactó directamente sobre el vehículo blindado, pero la velocidad con la que se aproximó permitió que los ocupantes pudieran escapar antes de la explosión. La organización humanitaria Proliska, con la que viajaban los informadores, denunció este hecho como una violación del derecho internacional humanitario.

Lamine Yamal, del FC Barcelona, es el jugador con más insultos racistas recibidos en LaLiga, representando el 60% de los mensajes, seguido de Vinícius Júnior con el 29%. Los insultos están vinculados a su origen y color de piel y van desde expresiones despectivas como “moro de mierda” hasta mensajes que incitan a la violencia o la exclusión, como “deberían echarlo de España así como vino, en patera”. El informe también señala a los clubes más afectados, con el Real Madrid y el Barça liderando las estadísticas de impacto, y destaca que los episodios se intensifican en partidos de alta repercusión, como el Clásico.

A lo largo de la entrevista, Baby aborda cómo la falta de juicios a los responsables de la dictadura ha condicionado la relación de España con su pasado. En su opinión, la Transición se hizo en continuidad con el régimen franquista, sin romper con él, lo que permitió a la derecha española mantener una relación intacta con ese pasado autoritario. La historiadora también destaca cómo el rechazo de las derechas españolas a políticas de memoria histórica, como la Ley de Memoria Democrática de 2022, es una muestra clara de la resistencia a asumir la responsabilidad por los crímenes del franquismo. Según Baby, esta falta de ruptura con el franquismo se debe a que la derecha española no ha sentido la necesidad de hacerlo, a diferencia de otros países europeos que, después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, tuvieron que renov]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sophie-baby-la-derecha-espanola-no-ha-roto-con-el-franquismo-por-falta-de-necesidad-de-hacerlo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sophie-baby-la-derecha-espanola-no-ha-roto-con-el-franquismo-por-falta-de-necesidad-de-hacerlo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 23:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo hacer un check-in seguro sin dar tu DNI en un hotel]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia relata una experiencia personal en la que una viajera se encontró en un conflicto con la recepción de un hotel que insistía en hacer una copia de su DNI, a pesar de que la ley española no obliga a ello.

Inma, una de las afectadas, recibió una carta de Sanidad indicando que sus análisis eran normales, mientras que su médico le había informado de un resultado positivo que requería más pruebas. Posteriormente, desde la Consejería de Sanidad explicaron que este error se debió a una incidencia informática que afectó a la actualización de los archivos. Esta confusión provocó que incluso algunas personas recibieran notificaciones cuando ni siquiera se habían realizado las pruebas.

Aunque las ocupaciones denunciadas bajaron aproximadamente un 18,1% entre enero y octubre de este año respecto al año anterior, aumentaron los intentos frustrados, atribuidos a una mayor actuación policial y a una mayor concienciación de los propietarios. En 2024 se contabilizaron 6.257 ocupaciones denunciadas, una media de 17 al día, con incremento del 8% respecto a 2023; 2025 muestra 4.345 denuncias en los primeros diez meses, cifra que podría situarse por debajo de 2024 al cierre del año. Moriana señala que la mayoría de las ocupaciones consumadas son usurpaciones pacíficas, con un bajo porcentaje de violaciones de domicilio.

Casos como el del Prestige, el Yak-42, el accidente del Metro de Valencia, y los atentados del 11M muestran cómo los responsables políticos en el gobierno han mentido, ocultado información y desechado la verdad para proteger sus intereses. El ejemplo más destacado es el de la DANA, donde se repitieron estrategias similares a las que ya se vieron en desastres anteriores. En el caso del Prestige, la decisión de Manuel Fraga de irse de cacería mientras el crudo alcanzaba las costas gallegas es un claro ejemplo de la falta de gestión responsable. Similarmente, en el Yak-42, Federico Trillo intentó desviar la culpa del accidente hacia los pilotos, sin asumir la responsabilidad política del desastre.

Este innovador material combina fibras de aramida (el polímero que compone el Kevlar) con nanotubos de carbono alineados a escala molecular. Con solo 1,8 mm de grosor, este tejido es capaz de detener una bala viajando a 300 metros por segundo, superando al Kevlar y otros materiales como el Dyneema. El nuevo material ofrece ventajas significativas en términos de ligereza y movilidad, lo que podría revolucionar el diseño de chalecos antibalas, vehículos blindados y aeronaves militares. Al mejorar la resistencia dinámica y la tenacidad de las fibras, el nuevo material logra una absorción de energía más eficiente que el Kevlar, que necesita un grosor mayor para detener la misma bala. Este avance podría dar lugar a la creación de armaduras más ligeras y efectivas, sin sacrificar la protección.

La situación ha puesto de relieve la creciente desigualdad en el país, donde los salarios estancados y el elevado costo de vida empujan a muchas personas a depender de este tipo de ayudas para sobrevivir. Expertos destacan que, aunque el fenómeno es parcialmente impulsado por crisis económicas como la de 2008 y la pandemia de COVID-19, también hay causas estructurales, como la desigualdad salarial y el encarecimiento de la vida.

Según Lindo, la crianza actual no está enfocada en formar buenos seres humanos, sino en preparar a los niños para ser triunfadores en el ámbito académico y profesional. Asegura que la sobreprotección comienza desde una edad temprana y se extiende hasta la universidad, un fenómeno que también se refleja en los casos de padres que intervienen en las gestiones académicas de sus hijos adultos, incluso en universidades. Además, comparó la situación actual con la de los niños nacidos en los años 80, que según Lindo, tenían más libertad e independencia de sus padres.

El comité de empresa de la Sociedad Valenciana de Gestión Integral de los Servicios de Emergencias (Sgise) ha exigido medidas inmediatas para garantizar la operatividad del servicio las 24 horas del día. Este servicio, prometido por el presidente de la Generalitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón, aún no se ha puesto en marcha, debido a la falta de personal y recursos. Se estima que faltan 300 bomberos para cubrir los turnos y la situación se ha visto agravada por la inestabilidad en la dirección del servicio, con dimisiones sucesivas. Ante este panorama, el comité ha solicitado una solución urgente, con un plazo de una semana, y advierte que de no obtener respuesta, iniciarán acciones legales.

El artículo describe cómo estos bloqueos afectan a numerosas pymes, desde pasarelas de pago y bancos hasta plataformas de venta y servicios de hosting, provocando caídas de servicio y pérdidas significativas. A través de testimonios de empresarios como José Manuel Louro y Daniel Infante, se ilustra cómo la interrupción de conexiones IP, ordenada por LaLiga y basada en direcciones IP compartidas, genera daños colaterales, afectando a clientes y proveedores y dificultando operaciones como ventas online y generación de informes contables. Cloudflare y otras grandes compañías son citadas como víctimas colaterales, con la defensa de la neutralidad de la red y la protección de sitios web comprometidos.

Se caracteriza por la acumulación de grasa en el hígado en ausencia de consumo elevado de alcohol y está relacionada con el sobrepeso, la obesidad, la diabetes tipo 2 y el síndrome metabólico. El inicio de la enfermedad suele ser silencioso, lo que dificulta su detección precoz y puede desembocar en complicaciones graves como fibrosis, cirrosis o cáncer de hígado. El diagnóstico definitivo requiere actualmente una biopsia hepática, pero estudios recientes proponen indicadores no invasivos como el índice de hígado graso (FLI) y la ecografía para identificar de manera temprana a las personas en riesgo. Un estudio realizado por Quirónprevención, basado en más de 3.000 reconocimientos médicos laborales, demuestra que el FLI es una herramienta útil y coste-efectiva para detectar la enfermedad y facilitar intervenciones preventivas antes de que evoluci]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-indice-de-higado-graso-fli-mejora-el-cribado-laboral-precoz-de-la-enfermedad-hepatica-silenciosa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-indice-de-higado-graso-fli-mejora-el-cribado-laboral-precoz-de-la-enfermedad-hepatica-silenciosa</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 19:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El discurso de Abascal sobre la libertad de prensa, puesto en duda tras comentarios y contradicciones públicas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Santiago Abascal, líder de Vox, ha declarado recientemente que su formación hará 'que toda la prensa pueda ser libre', buscando así transmitir una imagen de defensa de la libertad informativa en España. Sin embargo, estas palabras han sido ampliamente cuestionadas, sobre todo en el programa 'Malas Lenguas', donde se recurrió a declaraciones pasadas tanto de Abascal como de otros miembros de Vox para subrayar las contradicciones del partido respecto a la libertad de prensa. Se recordó que, poco tiempo atrás, Vox había mostrado un deseo explícito de cerrar espacios informativos críticos como ese propio programa, lo que deja en evidencia un doble discurso evidente. Además, se citaron comentarios desafiantes de Manuel Mariscal, diputado de Vox, sobre 'entrar en RTVE con motosierra o lanzallamas', poniendo de manifiesto la postura beligerante que algunos miembros de Vox tienen hacia medios públicos.

Pese a las solicitudes del consejo de administración para convocar elecciones que renovaran a sus miembros, la dirección general del ente público no ha cumplido con el mandato y ha dejado al Consejo Profesional sin funcionar. El proceso para la renovación del órgano ha quedado suspendido por más de siete meses, lo que ha provocado el malestar de los trabajadores de Canal Sur.

Novak, conocido por ser el creador del programa Fintopio para transferencias rápidas de criptomonedas, había atraído alrededor de 500 millones de dólares en inversiones antes de desaparecer con el dinero. Este fraude dejó sin salarios a empleados de Fintopio y a inversionistas de China y el Medio Oriente sin sus fondos. Según los informes, Novak se hacía pasar por amigo de Pavel Durov, fundador de Telegram, aunque esta relación nunca fue confirmada. La pareja fue asesinada en una villa alquilada en la ciudad de Hatta, donde, bajo el pretexto de reunirse con posibles inversores, fueron atrapados por los criminales que exigieron la clave del monedero criptográfico de Novak.

La decisión de la jueza Karin Immergut, designada por el propio Trump, concluye que el despliegue de tropas violaba la autoridad de los gobiernos estatal y local, lo que representa una derrota para el mandatario republicano. Esta sentencia pone fin a semanas de litigios sobre la legalidad de las acciones federales en ciudades sin el consentimiento de las autoridades locales. La jueza destacó que la intervención de las tropas no estaba justificada, ya que no existían evidencias de que las protestas fueran una amenaza significativa para la seguridad pública ni que dificultaran la aplicación de las leyes migratorias.

En total, más de 140.000 personas fueron asesinadas por los sublevados y la dictadura hasta 1950, mientras que más de 49.000 murieron a manos de los republicanos. A pesar de los avances en la recuperación de la memoria histórica, los cuerpos de muchas de estas víctimas siguen enterrados sin una sepultura digna, en lugares como cementerios, cunetas y campos. A partir del año 2000, se comenzaron a realizar exhumaciones científicas, destacando la de Priaranza del Bierzo como un hito en este proceso. En 2014, la ONU instó a España a continuar buscando a los desaparecidos. Hasta la fecha, se han recuperado los restos de más de 17.000 personas, y se estima que otras 12.000 podrían ser exhumadas en el futuro.

En particular, se analizan casos como el de la DANA en Valencia en 2024, el Yak-42, el 11M, y los casos de mujeres afectadas por negligencias en mamografías en Andalucía. En todos estos casos, el PP ha mostrado una actitud de indiferencia, incluso acusando a las víctimas de politizar sus tragedias o cuestionando su sufrimiento. Esta tendencia de maltrato hacia las víctimas es parte de un patrón sistemático de la derecha española, según el autor. La crítica abarca la actitud del PP en el Congreso, donde los diputados de este partido se negaron a aplaudir a los familiares de las víctimas de la DANA, mostrando así un total desdén por el dolor ajeno.

A pesar de la ayuda militar internacional, las fuerzas armadas ucranianas enfrentan un creciente descontento interno debido a la alta mortalidad, la falta de moral y la corrupción en el proceso de reclutamiento. Se destaca el aumento de casos de deserción, con 110.000 registradas solo en 2025, y el fenómeno del 'escaqueo' masivo, donde más de seis millones de hombres en edad militar eludieron su responsabilidad al no actualizar sus datos de registro. Además, se abordan las prácticas de corrupción dentro de los centros de reclutamiento y el uso de sobornos para evitar la movilización. Las autoridades están luchando para lograr que los ucranianos se alisten, pero la falta de confianza en el gobierno y el ejército, sumada a la creciente deserción, complica la situación.

Aunque la mayoría de las personas sabe que el tabaco es una causa conocida de cáncer, el alcohol sigue siendo una amenaza menos reconocida. En una encuesta a más de 6.700 personas, el 52,9% respondió que no sabía si el alcohol influía en el riesgo de cáncer, mientras que solo un 37,1% reconoció su efecto negativo. Esta desinformación es preocupante, ya que las creencias erróneas sobre la relación entre el alcohol y el cáncer podrían llevar a la gente a mantener hábitos perjudiciales. El estudio también identificó que los fumadores, las personas con menos nivel educativo y los que consumen alcohol habitualmente son los más propensos a subestimar este riesgo.

Los datos recogidos permiten estudiar la dinámica de la marea estelar durante la fase de espaguetización y la rápida liberación de energía, que se tradujo en una emisión de rayos y luz en varias longitudes de onda. Este tipo de eventos, aunque raros, aporta información clave sobre la tasa de consumo de materia por los agujeros negros y la influencia de estos objetos en la evolución de galaxias.

En su núcleo, el trumpismo propone un autoritarismo extremo, con políticas de represión, persecución de opositores y medidas que destruyen derechos fundamentales como la inmigración, los derechos de género y el bienestar social. En el ámbito económico, promueve un neoliberalismo radical, con recortes fiscales a los más ricos y un gasto social reducido, lo que profundiza las desigualdades sociales.

En una entrevista breve con Silvia Intxaurrondo, Nogueras no logró enumerar tres mejoras concretas para Cataluña que, según la periodista, deberían derivarse del bloqueo.

Asegura que las constantes lesiones le han ayudado a comprender mejor su cuerpo y a mantener un enfoque más equilibrado, dejando atrás la ansiedad por los resultados. Además, reflexiona sobre cómo el tenis puede ser un deporte muy solitario, con presiones constantes que afectan tanto al cuerpo como a la mente, y subraya la importancia de tener un entorno de apoyo.

Los hogares fueron responsables de casi un 30% de las emisiones totales, seguidos de la industria manufacturera (23,8%) y el sector agrícola (16,6%). La única actividad que experimentó una reducción significativa de emisiones fue el suministro energético, con un descenso del 10,3%. Por otro lado, el sector de transporte y almacenamiento aumentó sus emisiones un 4,8%. En términos generales, las emisiones totales en 2024 fueron de 279,9 millones de toneladas de gases de efecto invernadero, un 0,2% menos que en el año anterior.

Estas coronas no solo representaban el valor en batalla, sino que también otorgaban prestigio y reconocimiento dentro de la sociedad romana. Algunas coronas, como la cívica, se entregaban a aquellos que salvaban a sus compañeros, mientras que otras, como la corona mural o la naval, premiaban hazañas específicas en el combate. La corona graminea, una de las más prestigiosas, solo podía ser otorgada por los propios soldados a un comandante que hubiera salvado a todo un ejército. Estas condecoraciones también eran un medio para ascender en la vida política, ya que los veteranos las exhibían en sus campañas y desfiles. Además, las coronas servían como símbolos de honor personal y de lealtad al Imperio, y eran utilizadas en diversos contextos para reforzar el estatus social y político de sus portadores.

La sustitución de marcas occidentales por productos locales ha sido evidente en las calles de Moscú, y el país ha logrado mantener su nivel de exportaciones. Sin embargo, las sanciones han tenido efectos negativos en sectores como el bancario y el seguro, lo que obligó a Rusia a crear alternativas a sistemas internacionales como SWIFT.

Estas acciones han permitido que la deforestación en la Amazonía brasileña alcance su nivel más bajo en más de una década. La deforestación y la ganadería son las principales fuentes de emisiones del país. Según un informe del Observatorio del Clima, la caída de las emisiones fue del 16,7 % en 2023, lo que refleja la recuperación del control gubernamental sobre la deforestación tras los años de descontrol bajo la presidencia de Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2022).

Con un 22,8% de los españoles apoyando su figura como el más destacado desde 1978, Sánchez supera a Adolfo Suárez, quien ocupa el segundo lugar con un 19,2%. José María Aznar se sitúa en tercera posición con un 15%, mientras que Mariano Rajoy cierra la lista con solo un 7,2%, siendo el presidente peor valorado. Los datos de esta encuesta reflejan una clara polarización política, con los votantes progresistas mostrando una fuerte adhesión hacia Sánchez, mientras que la derecha sigue identificando a Aznar como su principal referente. Estos resultados se publican justo cuando un sondeo de intención de voto muestra un empate técnico entre PP y PSOE, con Vox ganando terreno.

La ceremonia incluyó el bautismo simbólico con sidra, en homenaje a la tradición vasca, realizado por Caroline Marchand, esposa de Robert Grenier. El proceso de bajada estuvo marcado por la expectación de cientos de personas y por el comentario optimista de Xabier Agote, director de Albaola, quien aseguró que el carro de varado no se atascó y que el barco, cargado con 50.000 kilos de piedras, descendió sin contratiempos y quedó sobre el agua con la bodega llena. Tras la botadura, la nao fue remolcada a la dársena industrial para continuar con la instalación de mástiles, velas y ancla.

El Gobierno de Asturias está llevando a cabo un plan de gestión que autoriza la extracción de hasta 53 ejemplares de lobo, sobre una población estimada de 345, lo que ha supuesto un avance del 36% del programa hasta la fecha. Este programa está orientado a reducir los daños causados por los lobos al ganado en áreas rurales. Las extracciones se realizan bajo la supervisión de la Guardia del Medio Natural, y aunque el verano ha sido una temporada menos eficiente debido a las condiciones del terreno, el otoño y el invierno ofrecen mejores condiciones para la localización y el control de los lobos.

Construidos a principios del siglo XX por el maestro carpintero Antonio Marí Aguirre, fueron diseñados para el transporte de mercancías a lo largo del Mediterráneo. Tras décadas de servicio, ambos buques vivieron destinos dramáticos: el 'Pascual Flores' fue hundido durante la Guerra Civil, reflotado, y luego renombrado como 'Vulcano', mientras que el 'Carmen Flores' pasó por diversas manos hasta convertirse en una unidad auxiliar para trabajos submarinos. A pesar de sus diversas vicisitudes, hoy ambos barcos siguen vivos.

Según las fuentes citadas por ElPlural.com, la reunión, celebrada en Valencia, contaría con representantes de Vox como Ignacio Garriga y Montse Lluis, y dejaría entrever unas condiciones de investidura muy duras para el PP valenciano, incluida la posibilidad de exigir lectura institucional de un escrito con peticiones como el rechazo al pacto verde y la negativa a acoger inmigrantes.

Aunque se presenta como una manifestación pacífica y religiosa, en realidad fue un acto estratégico respaldado por el régimen de Hassan II de Marruecos y apoyado indirectamente por Estados Unidos. La marcha, que movilizó a más de 350.000 civiles marroquíes, fue una presión directa sobre España para que abandonara el territorio saharaui y entregara la soberanía a Marruecos. A pesar de que la ONU había dictaminado que el Sáhara no formaba parte de Marruecos, el régimen marroquí utilizó la movilización como una excusa para la invasión. El resultado fue la división del pueblo saharaui, la ocupación marroquí y el exilio masivo. 50 años después, la resolución de la ONU ha dado un giro al conflicto, reconociendo el plan de autonomía marroquí y excluyendo el referéndum de autodeterminación.

Sin embargo, aunque Torres sí negó tener una relación estrecha con Aldama en varias comisiones, reconoció en otras ocasiones haber contactado con Koldo, algo que el informe de la UCO confirma. En total, Torres ha admitido en hasta cinco ocasiones haber mantenido comunicación con Koldo, tanto en el Congreso como en el Senado y el Parlamento de Canarias, a pesar de las negaciones iniciales sobre Aldama. El ministro mencionó sus intercambios con Koldo en el contexto de su trabajo en el Ministerio de Transportes, lo que desmiente la acusación de Tellado.

La sentencia también obliga a devolver los salarios cobrados indebidamente. La maniobra, que comenzó tras las elecciones municipales de 2019, permitió al PP acceder al gobierno local, a pesar de haber quedado en segundo lugar en los comicios.

El análisis revela una notable fusión cultural: se identifican elementos indoeuropeos, relacionados con la lengua itálica y el lusitano, pero también componentes afroasiáticos/semíticos, como el uso de nombres divinos vinculados al refugio, el sol y la divinidad universal, y términos no indoeuropeos para los productos ofrecidos.

Ambientada en un futuro distópico donde la sociedad está gobernada por un régimen totalitario, la historia sigue a Ben Richards, un policía que se niega a disparar a manifestantes pacíficos y es encarcelado. Tras escapar y ser recapturado, se le ofrece participar en el brutal programa televisivo 'Perseguido', donde prisioneros son cazados por gladiadores en un juego mortal. Dirigida por Paul Michael Glaser, la película mezcla acción, sátira social y un tono caricaturesco, lo que le otorga una atmósfera algo kitsch y desconectada de las intenciones del guion original de Stephen King. A pesar de su éxito en taquilla, el filme recibió críticas mixtas, destacando la falta de profundidad en su dirección y guion.

Aunque no se pudo determinar la magnitud exacta del temblor mediante técnicas convencionales, se estima que la intensidad fue de alrededor de 2,2 en la escala de Richter. Este tipo de temblores, conocidos como sismos LP (de largo período), se caracterizan por vibraciones de baja frecuencia y por la ausencia o atenuación de las fases sísmicas habituales. En este caso, los expertos explican que están asociados al movimiento de fluidos hidrotermales dentro del volcán, parte de un proceso de presurización que lleva observándose desde 2016.

El ganador del Premio Planeta llega al programa de Pablo Motos con una imagen de celebridad que contrasta con la crítica literaria que ha seguido a la publicación de su novela. A lo largo del fragmento destacado, Del Val denuncia que las críticas se basan en guerras editoriales y en un supuesto odio hacia su persona, mientras él defiende su posición como escritor crítico con el poder. El diálogo cubre desde su infancia y su origen familiar, pasando por su tratamiento médico y su trayectoria profesional, hasta la discusión sobre fragmentos de su prosa que circulan en redes. El artículo sugiere un tono de victimización por parte del invitado y critica la forma en que ciertos segmentos de la prensa y las redes sociales han tratado su figura y su obra. En conjunto, la pieza ofrece una mirada crítica al fenómeno de la celebridad literaria y a las dinámicas de poder entre editoriales, televisió]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-del-val-defiende-su-obra-y-enfrenta-criticas-en-el-hormiguero</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-del-val-defiende-su-obra-y-enfrenta-criticas-en-el-hormiguero</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 23:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rajoy exige elecciones mientras Villaroya critica la desconexión de los políticos con los problemas reales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El expresidente del Gobierno, Mariano Rajoy, ha solicitado en una entrevista en Herrera en COPE la convocatoria de elecciones generales, argumentando que el actual Ejecutivo de Pedro Sánchez no representa los intereses del pueblo y que España vive un periodo ‘sombrío’. Rajoy calificó el momento actual como el más oscuro desde la aprobación de la Constitución y afirmó que el gobierno debería dimitir. Sin embargo, su declaración no pasó desapercibida y el periodista José Miguel Villaroya lo criticó en el programa Malas Lenguas de RTVE. Villaroya reprochó a los políticos que, en vez de hablar de los verdaderos problemas que afectan a la ciudadanía, se dedicaran a la política partidista, pidiendo elecciones según les convenga. Destacó que la situación es especialmente dura para los jóvenes que no pueden emanciparse, para aquellos que no tienen trabajo o para quienes, con varios empleos, necesitan acudir a Cáritas para alimentarse.

Según los socialistas, el listado presentado por Mazón no incluye todas las llamadas, como las que fueron canceladas entre él y la exconsellera de Emergencias, Salomé Pradas. A pesar de que el PSPV defendía la importancia de esta información para la comparecencia de Mazón, la mayoría conservadora de la comisión no lo consideró esencial, argumentando que se puede aportar en otro momento. Además, la oposición ha criticado la alteración de la hora de la comparecencia, que se celebrará a las 16:00 horas, en lugar de la habitual a las 10:30, acusando al Gobierno de intentar evitar los informativos.

A través de experimentos en laboratorio, el estudio demuestra que esta cepa produce una enzima llamada L-asparaginasa que transforma el aminoácido L-asparagina en aspartato y amonio. La liberación de amonio ha mostrado tener efectos citotóxicos relevantes sobre cultivos celulares de riñón embrionario humano (HEK 293 T), con una reducción significativa de la viabilidad celular. Además, se ha comprobado en modelos de nematodos (Caenorhabditis elegans) que la bacteria es capaz de colonizar de manera rápida y mantenida el tracto reproductivo de estos animales, ocasionando cierta mortalidad. El trabajo caracteriza la enzima bacteriana como halotolerante y especialmente activa en medios alcalinos, además de mostrar una alta similitud con otras asparaginasas marinas.

Según los datos de la encuesta, un 65% de los simpatizantes de Aliança Catalana y un 55% de los de Vox muestran un perfil conspiranoico. Este fenómeno se relaciona con un escepticismo generalizado hacia la información proporcionada por expertos e instituciones, que se ve reemplazada por creencias en realidades ocultas. Además, los votantes con estas características son más propensos a informarse a través de las redes sociales y a confiar en fuentes no convencionales. La encuesta también destaca que los votantes más jóvenes, especialmente los hombres, tienden a valorar más el nivel de vida que la democracia, un hecho que refleja una creciente tendencia autoritaria en la sociedad catalana.

El origen de la acusación es la difusión de un bulo por parte de Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, jefe de gabinete de la presidenta madrileña, quien admitió durante el juicio que la supuesta existencia de un pacto entre la Fiscalía y el empresario Alberto González Amador era simplemente una deducción personal y no basada en información verificada. La presión mediática generada por esta manipulación provocó que la Fiscalía publicara una nota oficial aclarando los hechos, y que el Tribunal Supremo iniciara una investigación sobre si se había cometido un delito al divulgar el contenido de un correo del abogado de González Amador. Sin embargo, quedó demostrado en el juicio que el citado correo ya era conocido por la prensa antes de que llegase al Fiscal General, lo que desmonta la base de la acusación penal.

La nueva identidad del equipo para la temporada 2026, que dejó de incluir el nombre de Israel, no ha sido suficiente para calmar la situación. Esta decisión afecta a alrededor de 25 corredores y al personal, que ahora se enfrentan a la incertidumbre, con el equipo buscando nuevos patrocinadores. Premier Tech, que ha estado involucrada en el ciclismo durante 30 años, destacó que su apoyo siempre ha sido para el crecimiento del deporte y el desarrollo de ciclistas, especialmente de Quebec y Canadá.

Esta lección fue reveladora no solo para los estudiantes, que aprendieron de forma práctica cómo cuestionar lo que daban por hecho, sino también para el propio docente, que experimentó en primera persona cómo el método científico puede cuestionar hasta las intuiciones más profundas.

Sin embargo, lo que debería haber sido un proceso rutinario se ha convertido en una tragedia para millones de personas, que enfrentan aumentos drásticos en sus primas o la pérdida total de su cobertura médica. Esto se debe a la decisión del Congreso de no renovar las subvenciones públicas aprobadas durante la pandemia, que ayudaban a los ciudadanos a costear sus seguros privados. El precio medio de las primas ha aumentado significativamente, y sin la ayuda pública, más de 4 millones de personas se quedarán sin seguro médico, lo que aumenta la desigualdad social en un país donde la salud es tratada como un negocio.

En los últimos tres años, el Producto Interno Bruto apenas creció un 1,44%, lo que revela una profunda falta de dinamismo en su economía. Además, el país pierde un promedio de 126.000 habitantes anualmente, lo que afecta la productividad y el consumo interno. La competencia de China se ha convertido en una amenaza cada vez mayor, ya que el gigante asiático avanza en tecnología y producción de bienes que antes eran exclusivos de Italia, como los productos 'Made in Italy'. Este fenómeno se combina con un mercado laboral estancado y un sistema productivo que no logra adaptarse a los nuevos desafíos globales.

En una reciente entrevista, Quiles señaló que se trata de 'financiación privada' proveniente de 'empresas y empresarios' que apoyan su causa, sin especificar nombres. A pesar de especulaciones sobre posibles vínculos con organismos como el CNI o partidos políticos como el Partido Popular, Quiles se ha mantenido firme en su negativa a proporcionar más información. El polémico activista justificó su decisión argumentando que no tiene obligación de dar explicaciones sobre sus fuentes de financiación, ya que no ocupa un cargo público ni depende de fondos públicos. La entrevista destaca el carácter privado de los fondos que sustentan su actividad, que no solo cubren los eventos en universidades, sino también su seguridad personal mediante un equipo de guardaespaldas.

En sus revelaciones, Calviño detalla tensiones durante la elaboración del Decreto Ley de vivienda, afirmando que la negociación con Pablo Iglesias condujo a una versión del texto con las premisas defendidas por Podemos, incluyendo la congelación de alquileres y hipotecas. Según su relato, Iglesias exigió congelar pagos de alquileres e hipotecas, y Calviño sostiene que, pese a las discrepancias con Yolanda Díaz respecto a la reforma laboral impulsada por el PP, finalmente se impuso la versión que respondía a esas presiones.

Países como el Reino Unido, Alemania, Francia e Italia desarrollaron regimientos ciclistas para proporcionar una mayor movilidad en el campo de batalla. Las bicicletas, en ese momento consideradas una herramienta moderna y económica, ayudaron a los soldados a realizar tareas de patrullaje, reconocimiento y enlace entre frentes. En el Reino Unido, los Cyclist Battalions del Army Cyclist Corps fueron fundamentales en misiones de exploración, sobre todo en zonas como Bélgica. Alemania, por su parte, empleó a los Radfahrertruppen para incursiones rápidas y como unidades de reconocimiento, mientras que Francia contaba con los bataillons de chasseurs cyclistes para labores de vigilancia.

Sin embargo, el problema persiste en la actualidad debido a las obsoletas ratios de personal.

Hoy en día, más del 80% de los internos superan los 83 años y requieren cuidados continuos, mientras que las ratios actuales fueron diseñadas para residencias de personas semiautónomas.

Aunque ambos tienen un largo historial de detenciones y condenas pendientes, la jueza ha considerado que no existe riesgo de reincidencia. Los ladrones, parte de una banda especializada en el robo de relojes de lujo, fueron identificados rápidamente por los Mossos d'Esquadra, quienes destacaron su alta profesionalidad. A pesar de sus 72 detenciones y múltiples condenas no cumplidas, la jueza argumentó que la violencia empleada en el robo fue mínima, lo que permitió aplicar una pena más baja. Este caso resalta la controversia sobre la reincidencia delictiva y la percepción de impunidad de ciertos delincuentes, especialmente en delitos como el robo de relojes de alta gama.

La noticia ha llamado la atención por la ausencia de una fórmula habitual en este tipo de decretos: la frase 'agradeciéndole los servicios prestados', que generalmente se incluye cuando se cierra la etapa de un presidente o cargo público. Este detalle se suma a otros precedentes de personalidades políticas, como el cese de Artur Mas en 2016, que también omitió ese reconocimiento. La falta de la coletilla ha sido interpretada como un gesto simbólico que podría reflejar desacuerdos con la gestión de Mazón durante su mandato. Mazón pasa ahora a ser presidente en funciones hasta que se elija a su sucesor en Les Corts Valencianes, un proceso que debe completarse en las próximas semanas. Si no se alcanza un acuerdo para elegir a un nuevo presidente, el presidente en funciones convocará nuevas elecciones.

Este fenómeno no es exclusivo de los turrones, ya que otros dulces navideños también han experimentado subidas de precios similares, como el turrón crujiente Dulce Noel. Aunque las empresas justifican los aumentos debido a los elevados costes de fabricación, como el encarecimiento del cacao y otros ingredientes, muchos consumidores perciben que el precio por kilo se ha disparado considerablemente.

En su investigación, Anton descubrió que Liselotte Bossert, su propia profesora de primaria, fue una de las personas que le ofreció refugio y lo protegió durante los últimos años de su vida. El caso de Mengele, conocido por los horrendos experimentos que realizó en Auschwitz, estuvo cubierto por una red de exiliados nazis en Latinoamérica que proporcionaron un entorno seguro para él.

En contraste, Portugal ha cerrado sus puertas a inmigrantes, endureciendo sus leyes de extranjería y ciudadanía, lo que podría afectar a su mercado laboral. La falta de trabajadores está llevando a una disminución de la tasa de desempleo, pero también a una disminución de la población activa, lo que podría frenar el crecimiento económico.

La caída de la natalidad en los últimos años ha sido alarmante, con una tasa de 1,12 hijos por mujer en 2024, una de las más bajas de Europa. Este fenómeno se ha visto reflejado especialmente en el aumento de nacimientos de madres mayores de 40 años, que ha crecido un 20% en la última década. La inseguridad económica, la precariedad laboral y la falta de proyectos compartidos entre las parejas son algunos de los principales factores detrás de este cambio demográfico. Según la experta Dolores López, la falta de esperanza en el futuro y la fragilidad de las relaciones afectan gravemente a la decisión de ser padres.

Se destacan ejemplos como la enseñanza de religión en centros financiados con fondos públicos, la financiación mediante IRPF y el reconocimiento del matrimonio canónico con efectos civiles. Se argumenta que estos privilegios erosionan la neutralidad del Estado y la laicidad, y que la presencia de una Diócesis Castrense financiada con fondos públicos es un vestigio anticuado. Se subraya que la religión debe ser libre, pero el Estado también debe ser neutral, separando la religión de la enseñanza pública y de las estructuras estatales. Se propone revisar o incluso denunciar unilateralmente estos acuerdos, conforme a la Convención de Viena, para avanzar hacia una educación pública neutral, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/revision-de-los-acuerdos-con-la-santa-sede-para-garantizar-la-neutralidad-y-la-libertad-de-conciencia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/revision-de-los-acuerdos-con-la-santa-sede-para-garantizar-la-neutralidad-y-la-libertad-de-conciencia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 13:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Despidos en Sidenor por defender los derechos laborales en los talleres hidráulicos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cuatro trabajadores de la empresa Sidenor en Vitoria-Gasteiz han sido despedidos después de reclamar la equiparación salarial entre los empleados de los talleres hidráulicos y el resto de talleres de mantenimiento. Tras una reclamación formal, la empresa reconoció las nuevas condiciones laborales y equiparó a los trabajadores con sus compañeros, pero posteriormente les retiró los derechos adquiridos y exigió el reembolso de la diferencia salarial. Cuando los afectados judicializaron la situación, la empresa abrió expedientes disciplinarios que culminaron en los despidos. El sindicato ELA considera que esta acción es una represalia por la actividad sindical y una vulneración de derechos fundamentales como la libertad sindical.

Trump expresó su desacuerdo en una rueda de prensa celebrada el 7 de noviembre de 2025, asegurando que un juez federal no debería dictar cómo gestionar los fondos en esta situación de cierre. El SNAP, que beneficia a unos 41.7 millones de personas al mes, se quedó sin fondos hace una semana debido al cierre, afectando especialmente a comunidades de minorías étnicas, incluidas unas 10 millones de personas latinas. La decisión judicial fue tomada por el juez John McConnell de Rhode Island, quien rechazó un plan propuesto por la Administración de Trump para financiar solo parcialmente el programa. Este conflicto se enmarca en un cierre gubernamental que ya lleva 37 días y que ha afectado a varios sectores, como la aviación comercial y de carga, con una dism]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-critica-el-fallo-judicial-que-obliga-a-financiar-el-programa-alimentario-snap-durante-el-cierre-del-gobierno</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-critica-el-fallo-judicial-que-obliga-a-financiar-el-programa-alimentario-snap-durante-el-cierre-del-gobierno</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 11:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenafuente ironiza sobre las memorias del rey emérito y otros temas de actualidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andreu Buenafuente ofreció una nueva dosis de humor y sarcasmo en su programa 'Futuro Imperfecto', donde abordó temas de actualidad política y social con su característico estilo. Uno de los temas más destacados fue la publicación de las memorias de Juan Carlos I, 'Reconciliación'. El cómico se burló del contenido del libro y sus peculiaridades, como el relato del rey emérito sobre su loro mudo en Abu Dabi, y criticó las razones detrás de la elección de Francia como lugar de publicación, sugiriendo que fue para evitar problemas con el rey Felipe VI. Además, Buenafuente comentó la dimisión de Carlos Mazón, expresidente de la Generalitat Valenciana, haciendo énfasis en la tardanza de su renuncia y su falta de autocrítica. También se hizo eco de otros momentos del programa, como las bromas sobre el Papa León XIV y su enfoque hacia bendiciones insólitas.

La madre, Kwanza, fue cuidadosamente monitorizada durante los 16 meses de gestación a través de análisis hormonales, un proceso que requirió mucha paciencia por parte de los cuidadores. El parto, que ocurrió en apenas 15 minutos, se produjo de forma inusual a mediodía, a diferencia de los partos habituales de esta especie. La cría, un macho saludable, ha mostrado un comportamiento ejemplar, buscando inmediatamente la leche materna y siguiendo a su madre. Este nacimiento supone un avance significativo en los esfuerzos de conservación de la especie, que está amenazada por la caza furtiva y la pérdida de hábitat.

Estas condiciones provocaron mortandades masivas de fauna acuática, incluido peces y delfines rosados del Amazonas, y dejaron al descubierto una tendencia de calentamiento acelerado en ecosistemas de agua dulce tropicales. El informe señala que estas temperaturas superan la tolerancia térmica de la mayoría de los peces amazónicos y advierte sobre riesgos para las comunidades ribereñas que dependen de estos recursos para alimentación y subsistencia. Los investigadores destacan que la intensidad de la radiación solar, la baja profundidad de los lagos, la ausencia de viento y la turbidez son factores clave que influyeron en el calentamiento extremo, con el viento jugando un papel especialmente determinante al reducir la pérdida de calor por evaporación y]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/extremo-calentamiento-de-lagos-amazonicos-temperaturas-que-superan-los-40-c-y-sus-impactos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/extremo-calentamiento-de-lagos-amazonicos-temperaturas-que-superan-los-40-c-y-sus-impactos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 11:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenidos dos hombres por revender citas para asilo a migrantes en Madrid]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha detenido a dos hombres que se dedicaban a obtener citas masivas en las oficinas de extranjería y asilo para luego venderlas a migrantes que necesitaban regularizar su situación administrativa en España.

Tras la victoria, Mamdani enfrentó un marco de cautela y preocupación por parte de las principales entidades judías estadounidenses, que expresaron la necesidad de vigilar de cerca su mandato para asegurar que se combata el antisemitismo y se protejan los derechos de la comunidad judía. Una encuesta de la CNN citada por la pieza indica que, aunque Mamdani ganó, el 63% de los votantes judíos respaldó al exgobernador Andrew Cuomo y solo un 33% apoyó a Mamdani.

El profesor Pablo Ángel Meira Cartea señala que esta desconexión se debe, en parte, a la politización del cambio climático y a la propagación de mensajes negacionistas que confunden a la población. Además, los ciudadanos sienten que no pueden hacer nada efectivo frente a este problema, lo que limita su motivación para actuar. En particular, los jóvenes, un grupo con acceso a la información, están mostrando una creciente indiferencia hacia la crisis climática, lo que representa una preocupación a largo plazo.
