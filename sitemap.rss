The incident occurred days before Trump reversed his earlier position on releasing Epstein's files. Trump was asked about his name being mentioned in emails from Epstein, which had recently resurfaced in public discourse. His abrupt response and name-calling attracted attention, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny around his ties to Epstein. The controversy around Epstein has been a longstanding issue, with several high-profile figures, including Trump, being linked to the late financier. In a surprising turn, Trump later agreed to sign a bill that would release the Epstein files, further fueling speculation about the former president’s involvement. The event is a stark reminder of how high-profile personalities like Trump continue to be questioned over their associations with Epstein, and how these interactions oft]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 22:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Military Expands Presence in Six African Nations]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent days, Russian state media have highlighted the increasing military presence of Russia in Africa. Reports describe operations carried out by the Russian Ministry of Defense with support from soldiers presented as experienced veterans. The footage, filmed mostly in Mali, suggests a structured deployment that spans five other African countries. The images feature bombers, helicopters, and armored vehicles operating in unspecified areas. The soldiers are described as veterans of the Ukraine war, redeployed to the African continent to combat jihadists. One soldier, when asked about his mission, mentions the constant mobilization of Ministry of Defense units, including those of the Africa Corps. This unit has gained importance following the dissolution of the Wagner Group, with Moscow gradually transferring Wagner’s overseas responsibilities to the Africa Corps. This change is evident in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, where Russia has formed new security alliances.

A recent report by the *Financial Times* questions whether this downturn is reversible. It attributes part of the decline to external factors, such as the ongoing commercial war and sanctions, but fails to offer specific causes. Notably, the number of unemployed in Germany has been steadily rising since February 2022, reaching its highest level in 14 years. This increase is linked to the economic impact of sanctions imposed on Russia, which, in turn, have affected Germany’s industrial sectors. While the U.S. is less impacted due to its energy independence, Germany is facing severe difficulties due to high energy prices, particularly gas, which is essential for its industries. U.S. companies, benefiting from cheaper energy, have become more competitive, leading some European businesses to relocate to the U.S. The piece also highlights Germany's continuing financial su]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Just Room Enough: The Tiny Island That Comes With a Big Question]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the concept of space for a typical middle-class family by contrasting the American dream of a two-story home with a porch and yard to the reality of a much smaller residence on Just Room Enough Island. Located in the Thousand Islands archipelago, which spans roughly 50 kilometers along the St. Lawrence River near Ontario and New York, the island is privately owned and measures about 300 square meters, containing just a single tree. Access is by boat, highlighting the paradox of modern abundance versus scarce private space. The Sizeland family purchased the rock in the 1950s, converting it into a summer residence with a tree and a couple of benches to enjoy river views. Nearby Heart Island features a larger castle-like structure begun in the early 20th century, which was unfinished for 73 years before restoration, now serving as a major tourist draw. The article juxtaposes fairy-tale architecture with a modest cottage on Just Room Enough, illustrating how extremes o]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/just-room-enough-the-tiny-island-that-comes-with-a-big-question</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/just-room-enough-the-tiny-island-that-comes-with-a-big-question</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Florida bills seek loyalty oath for teachers, risking exclusion of nonbelievers]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on two Florida bills, Senate Bill 430 and House Bill 147, that would require public school teachers and other educators to subscribe to a loyalty oath. The oath pledges to defend the U.S. and Florida constitutions, perform duties in a nonpartisan and ethical manner, and serve as a positive role model, with a final clause invoking God: “so help me God.” The piece notes that the option to affirm the oath exists, but the last four words remain mandatory, creating a potential barrier for atheists, Quakers, and others who avoid religious oaths. Critics, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, argue the oath effectively imposes a religious test for public employment and could be unconstitutional, given constitutional protections against religious tests and coercion. The article draws historical parallels and references legal principles that religious oaths cannot be required for public service, suggesting the bills amount to ideological conformity rather than patr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adapting to climate change amid a shifting political stance on climate discourse]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines how political rhetoric around climate change has shifted in the United States, with Florida exemplifying a broader trend where discussions of climate change face political resistance while preparations for climate-related impacts continue. Florida is highlighted as highly vulnerable to heat, drought, fires, floods, and hurricanes, prompting investments like the $1 billion Resilient Florida program aimed at helping local governments adapt to climate risks. The piece contrasts the national discourse—where Republicans have rolled back numerous climate initiatives and trimmed references to climate change—from the growing need to adapt to a warming world. It notes that even as climate discussions become politically charged or avoided, the reality of increasing extreme weather necessitates action, including measures such as burying power lines, relocating flood-prone homes, and expanding green infrastructure. Experts argue that adaptation and emission reductions are not ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adapting-to-climate-change-amid-a-shifting-political-stance-on-climate-discourse</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adapting-to-climate-change-amid-a-shifting-political-stance-on-climate-discourse</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 11:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump administration considering deportations of Ukrainians with final orders amid conscription concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is preparing to deport certain Ukrainians who have final removal orders, sending them back to Ukraine despite ongoing fears about conscription and Ukraine’s wartime vulnerabilities. The moves come as Washington intensifies efforts to increase deportations and Kyiv seeks to recalibrate its relationship with the United States. The article notes that overall Ukrainian deportations have declined in recent years, but officials are exploring targeted removals as part of broader immigration enforcement priorities. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quoted suggesting that those slated for removal might be repurposed or used in some capacity, reflecting the complex humanitarian and political considerations at play. The piece situates these potential deportations within a broader context of U.S. immigration policy, wartime alliances, and the challenge of balancing security, humanitarian concerns, and international di]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-considering-deportations-of-ukrainians-with-final-orders-amid-conscription-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-considering-deportations-of-ukrainians-with-final-orders-amid-conscription-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Romeu: another artist silenced after criticizing power]]></title><description><![CDATA[The piece recounts the career of Romeu, the longtime political cartoonist for El País and cofounder of El Jueves, who disappeared from the newspaper’s pages without explanation after three decades of work and more than ten thousand cartoons. The author suggests a motive tied to challenging powerful interests, describing Romeu as having crossed those in control and paying the price. The article references a subsequent account by another cartoonist, J.R. Mora, who details three cartoons published on dates in 2004, 2008, and 2009 that allegedly led to Romeu’s dismissal. The narrative frames Romeu’s firing as a symbolic red card, indicating a broader pattern of media consolidation and suppression of dissent. The tone blends nostalgia for Romeu’s recognizable iconography with a conspiracy-laden assertion about “the rulers of the world” and a “God of blood.” The post ends with an invitation to comment and share, followed by a disclaimer about licensing and a host of social sharing options.

The project carries a hefty price tag of around 800 billion euros, defined not by a single front but by a constellation of threats to critical infrastructure. A central element is the European Space Shield, intended to close nine gaps identified by the European Commission and safeguard critical space assets like Galileo navigation and secure IRIS communications from orbit-level interference and signal spoofing. The piece notes tensions with NATO over overlapping command structures and funding roles, with Brussels expected to advise on financing while member states maintain operational control. It highlights concerns about dependency on allies, particularly in light of Ukraine, and warns that ambitious plans may struggle to secure funding.

Lunojod 1, a wheel-equipped rover from the Ye-8 program, marked a milestone as the first robotic rover to traverse the Moon. Developed under OKB-1 and later restructured into Ye-8, Lunojod 1 was designed to accompany cosmonauts, potentially transporting crew if needed, and featured a pressurized cabin, solar panels, and a polonium-210 heat source. The craft rode to the Moon aboard a Proton rocket, with a two-stage descent system culminating in a controlled soft landing in Mare Imbrium. Lunojod 1 operated for eleven lunar days, traveling 10.54 km and returning hundreds of panoramas and tens of thousands of photographs, while displaying creative traces in the regolito. The mission faced a history of near-misses and earlier Lunojod iterations, including Ye-8-201, which failed at launch, and Ye-8-5 missions (Luna 15) that ended in disaster. The article also details the Lunojod program’s evolution, incl]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lunojod-1-and-the-unmade-lunojods-a-retrospective-on-soviet-lunar-rovers-and-their-ambitious-successors</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/lunojod-1-and-the-unmade-lunojods-a-retrospective-on-soviet-lunar-rovers-and-their-ambitious-successors</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 08:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[France sees net loss of factories as closures outpace openings amid slowed reindustrialization efforts]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes a persistent trend in Europe’s economy, focusing on France where the number of factory closures outpaces openings for the second consecutive year. Between January and mid-November, France opened 80 industrial zones and expanded 57 factories, while 108 factories closed or faced closure, resulting in a net loss of 28 plants. The data suggests more disinvestment than investment, with some investments originating abroad. The October industrial barometer noted a significant decline in openings versus closures in the first half of the year. The General Directorate of Companies reported 44 new plant openings and 86 significant expansions, against 82 plant closures and 39 significant reductions, yielding a net +9 balance that would be negative when considering only openings and closures. Although activity showed a positive net for the first half of the year, the trend signals a slowdown, with a reduced net increase in openings and expansions compared to the previous year’s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-sees-net-loss-of-factories-as-closures-outpace-openings-amid-slowed-reindustrialization-efforts</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-sees-net-loss-of-factories-as-closures-outpace-openings-amid-slowed-reindustrialization-efforts</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 07:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s Information War: Efforts to Reframe Gaza Genocide Narratives]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article argues that Israel’s international supporters are frantically attempting to rebuild a narrative around Gaza that absolves or minimizes its actions, framing Gaza as an existential struggle rather than a genocidal campaign. It contends that the Gaza conflict has revealed inconsistencies in the Western portrayal of the conflict, highlighting a shift in public opinion among Americans, with rising sympathy for Palestinians and a noticeable minority within the Republican base supporting an independent Palestinian state. The piece accuses Western media and platforms of censorship and bias, citing examples such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and other social networks, and asserts that pro-Palestinian voices face shadowbans and removal of content. It also criticizes coverage of alleged abuses and mass rape, arguing that terms are sanitized or reframed to minimize Israeli crimes. The author invokes the Gaza Tribunal’s statements, asserting that multiple actors are complicit in genocide thro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-information-war-efforts-to-reframe-gaza-genocide-narratives</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-information-war-efforts-to-reframe-gaza-genocide-narratives</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 04:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Global disillusion with climate policy and investment schemes]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on the 30th World Climate Conference held in Bethlehem, Brazil, noting the absence of leaders from the four largest CO2 emitters (China, the United States, India, and Russia). It asserts that decades of climate alarmism and catastrophism have been rejected by many, with headlines in major outlets doubting the effectiveness of climate policies. The piece focuses on Bill Gates’ alleged pivot away from climate panic toward business interests, suggesting investments in data centers and a preference for gas-fired power generation over nuclear revival. It criticizes the EU and Germany for ambitious decarbonization targets, claiming that emissions reductions in one region would be offset by rises elsewhere, facilitated by the European Emission Trading System. A sensational claim is made about a proposed fund to protect tropical forests, funded by governments and private vultures (funds), with returns tied to high-yield government bonds.

The incidents, part of a broader wave of raids targeting asylum seekers under the Trump administration, have sparked fear among Southern California’s Russian immigrant community. The couple had sought political asylum in 2023 after escaping persecution and military conscription in Russia, where anti-war policies and propaganda had intensified. They later received work permits and temporary authorization to stay while their claims were processed. In August, Perevalov was detained during an early-morning walk with their dog; Zaiko was alerted by handcuffs and a forced separation from her husband. The Times notes that the Biden administration had begun changing asylum protections in 2024, but the current climate under Trump’s deportation agenda has led to increased arrests of thos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-asylum-seekers-detained-in-southern-california-as-crackdown-on-pending-cases-intensifies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-asylum-seekers-detained-in-southern-california-as-crackdown-on-pending-cases-intensifies</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 02:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Federal judge orders release of immigrant teens detained in Virginia due to improper bond hearings]]></title><description><![CDATA[A federal judge in Alexandria ruled that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) violated due process by denying bond hearings to several immigrant youths, including two brothers aged 18 and 19, who were detained in Virginia facilities. The ruling could reshape ICE’s mandatory detention policy for youth in Virginia who have Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Virginia and other advocates, argue that ICE stripped deferred action and work authorization without explanation, undermining the protections SIJS was intended to provide since its creation in 1990. The case, Sarmiento et al. v Perry et al., emerges in a broader context where deferred action policies and humanitarian protections have faced policy reversals, potentially delaying or denying work authorization, driving vulnerable youths toward precarious situations. The judge’s decision to release the detainees hinges on due process and bond considerations, with potential implic]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-judge-orders-release-of-immigrant-teens-detained-in-virginia-due-to-improper-bond-hearings</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-judge-orders-release-of-immigrant-teens-detained-in-virginia-due-to-improper-bond-hearings</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Three Israeli Football Players Arrested in Tel Aviv on Rape Allegation Involving American Tourist]]></title><description><![CDATA[Three Israeli football players—two active players from the National League and Liga Alef, and a former player—were detained in Tel Aviv on allegations that they raped a 29-year-old American tourist. Police reported that the tourist filed a complaint on November 1, describing an assault that occurred earlier in November at a Tel Aviv hotel. According to Israel’s Channel 12, all three suspects are professional footballers, with one currently playing in the National League. Authorities believe the incident occurred after the woman met one of the players online. One of the defendants denied the accusation, characterizing the encounter as consensual and claiming the group partnered with two players in a hotel room; he asserted the woman consented to a threesome but refused one participant. The defense reiterated that the trio has no prior criminal record and is expecting release. Channel 12 noted that “the entire incident is documented,” with some materials reportedly circulating.

His sister, Gail McGrath Garabadian, confirmed the news in a heartfelt Facebook post, remembering him as 'an incredible son, brother, uncle, and friend.' McGrath's career spanned numerous iconic shows, with notable writing credits on 'The Simpsons,' including episodes like 'Homer’s Phobia,' 'Boy-Scoutz ‘n the Hood,' and 'The Devil and Homer Simpson.' He earned an Emmy in 1997 for his work on 'Homer's Phobia,' an episode that featured John Waters. McGrath began his career as a writer for 'Saturday Night Live' in the early '90s and worked alongside comedy legends like Chris Farley and Adam Sandler. He was nominated for an Emmy for his work on the show in 1992. In addition to 'The Simpsons' and 'SNL,' McGrath's career included writing for other animated shows like 'King of the Hill' and 'Mission Hill,' as well as 'The PJs' and 'Muppets Tonight.' ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dan-mcgrath-acclaimed-writer-for-the-simpsons-and-snl-passes-away-at-61</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dan-mcgrath-acclaimed-writer-for-the-simpsons-and-snl-passes-away-at-61</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 22:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[German Army Digitization Projects Stall as Digital Radios Fail to Deliver]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on Germany's attempt to modernize the Bundeswehr through the D-LBO program, backed by a 20 billion euro budget, focusing on equipping vehicles with software-defined radios for joint, high-speed voice and data transmissions. In December 2022, the Defense Ministry awarded a 2.9 billion euro contract to Rohde & Schwarz (with Thales) for VR500 radios (SVFuA) intended to ready a division for deployment to Lithuania by 2027. Field tests reportedly halted by September due to perceived inadequacy for troop use. User interfaces proved so complex that soldiers could contact only a few participants with significant effort and time, raising concerns about meeting deployment timelines. The integration of these radios into Leopard 2 tanks is labor-intensive, needing two mechanics and about 200 hours per vehicle. Communication delays of roughly three seconds threaten combat effectiveness, especially in drone encounters.

The report reveals that detainees faced daily beatings, denial of food, water, and medical care, and in some cases sexual abuse, during prolonged confinement. Guards reportedly wore hoods and used aliases to conceal identities, signaling an intent to operate outside accountability. The prisoners were held under El Salvador’s extended state of emergency, which limited access for families and defense lawyers and restricted information about detainees. Many of the Venezuelans had fled persecution in Venezuela and had open asylum claims in the U.S. when forcibly removed, challenging the notion that they were national security threats.

Speakers in the debate included former Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who characterized Israel as an “expansionist colonial state,” and Hillel Neuer, director of UN Watch, who vehemently opposed the motion. Neuer argued that the resolution represents an “inversion of reality,” contending that stability should be measured by who initiates conflict, not who defends. He pointed to Iran’s support for armed proxies in several Arab countries as evidence of the regime’s destabilizing role, noting that Arab states rely on Israel for their security. 

Shtayyeh went further, accusing Israel of flouting international law, disregarding United Nations resolutions, and operating as a “centre of a colonial regime” grounded in apartheid.

It highlights historical admonitions by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2001 about bureaucratic excess and misallocated funds, followed by later criticisms from President Obama in 2009 about unnecessary spending and opaque contracts awarded to defense contractors. The piece cites specific examples: the M10 Booker, a tank marketed as “light” that ended up as 42 tons and non-airworthy for certain transport, illustrating a broader pattern of mismanagement.

The crew, Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie, who spent almost 204 days in orbit and set a new Chinese endurance record, had to return to Earth using the newly arrived Shenzhou 21 vehicle. This unprecedented crew swap occurred after cracks appeared in one of Shenzhou 20's windows, likely caused by space debris or a meteoroid impact. As a precaution, Shenzhou 22 will be launched uncrewed to serve as a return vehicle for the crew of Shenzhou 21, who remain on the Chinese Space Station, while Shenzhou 20 will eventually return without crew. The incident mirrors contingency procedures seen in international programs, like Soyuz and Starliner, highlighting both the risks of spaceflight and the increasing capabilities of China's space infrastructure.

It claims the EU intends to establish an independent data-verification network across all official EU languages and empower the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) with new analytical powers to monitor elections and crises. The piece suggests that “independence” is a veneer for funding and controlling civil society groups, NGOs, and media, portraying this as part of a broader strategy tied to the Digital Services Act (LSD). It alleges Brussels uses the CERV, Creative Europe, and the Jean Monnet initiatives to propagate a pro-EU ideology and influence electoral outcomes, citing alleged cases in Romania and Moldova.

At NATO summits, many European leaders agreed to meet a US demand to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a target deemed unrealistic but indicative of a readiness to please Washington. The piece criticizes Trump for suggesting the US spends too much on collective defense, while Europeans are pressured to allocate more resources to defense and contemplate reducing American troop levels. Historical context is provided, noting US concerns since the 1970s about European and Japanese reliance on US protection for defense and economic development. The article highlights potential consequences if US forces withdraw, including the reintroduction of conscription and the political unpopularity of such a move.

The system emerged alongside Japan’s imperial expansion in East Asia and was officially managed by military leaders to control soldiers’ conduct and supposedly reduce venereal disease. Initially involving some voluntary Japanese prostitutes, the system shifted by 1938 to coercion and abduction facilitated by brokers and local agents, especially preying on vulnerable poor families. Captive women endured extreme violence, repeated sexual assaults—sometimes 30 to 40 times a day—and inhumane living conditions near battle zones, with many dying from trauma or execution by retreating troops.

It highlights China’s advanced automation, over 30,000 smart factories, and a Tesla gigafactory in Shanghai that outperforms its California site on output per worker. Despite these indicators, most studies claim Chinese industrial productivity is lower than in the United States, creating a paradox between high output and perceived inefficiency. The piece contends that standard productivity measures based on nominal value added can misrepresent true efficiency due to price differences, design/input factors, and the presence of original design manufacturers (ODM) versus original equipment manufacturers (OEM).

The technology uses photonics to carry qubits, with more than 1,000 optical components on a compact 6-inch silicon wafer, enabling a monolithic design and potential rapid deployment. Supporters claim the system can be deployed in about two weeks and scaled by linking multiple chips to reach up to 1 million qubits. However, production challenges persist due to material delicacy, with facilities reportedly producing 12,000 wafers annually and yielding roughly 350 chips per wafer. Critics argue that such quantum solutions remain niche and that real-world applicability is limited, noting that quantum computers currently outperform conventional systems only on a very small set of problems.

The study analyzed research from 1967 to 2018, focusing on both animal and human trials. Most studies were conducted on rats, with only one human trial included. The majority of these studies found that onion or onion extracts, especially in the form of juice or aqueous extract, positively influenced testosterone production. The mechanisms behind this effect include increased luteinizing hormone production, enhanced antioxidant defenses in the testes, reduced oxidative stress, improved insulin sensitivity, stimulation of nitric oxide production, and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase. Onions are rich in phytochemicals like quercetin, which are known for their antioxidant properties and may contribute to these benefits.

With only about 500 residents, the town stands out for its entirely Spanish-named streets—such as Calle Madrid, Avenida de Segovia, and Plaza de Granada. This naming is not a deliberate tribute to Spain’s most famous writer, Cervantes, but the result of a historical chain of accidents. The town takes its name from a 19th-century whaling ship named Cervantes, itself named after the Spanish author. The ship ran aground off the coast in 1844, and the rocks nearby became known as Cervantes Rocks. When a fishing community set up there roughly a century later and was officially recognized as a town in 1962, locals simply named the place Cervantes, in line with nearby features. When the town grew, needing proper addresses, all the streets were given Spanish place names, assumed to honor the author.

While intended to protect traditional manufacturing and reduce dependence on foreign goods, the tariffs have contributed to higher prices for both imported and domestic products, with modest but consistent inflation since their implementation. The article critiques the administration’s justification of these measures as a pathway to a nostalgic industrial golden age, arguing that actual outcomes include job losses in manufacturing, increased housing costs due to pricier building materials, and higher food and energy costs driven by disrupted supply chains and reduced investment in renewable energy. The piece highlights the mismatch between political rhetoric around “manly jobs” and the real labor market, where wage growth has been uneven and concentrated in sectors less associated with traditional masculinity.

The proposed measure, described as the 'industrial development acceleration' law, aims to shield Europe from Chinese industrial competition amid weak growth and investment. It would mandate the use of EU components and labor, local production within Europe, and the creation of added value on the continent, with joint ventures as an alternative. The piece cites concerns about deindustrialization in the EU and parallels with the US and Germany, highlighting potential risks of a broader trade war including more sanctions and tariffs.

The piece contrasts three positions: historicist accounts that assert a real, radical rabbi as the source of gospel narratives, mythologized history that blends fact with myth, and gospel truth claimed by many Christians. Tarico’s conversation with Fitzgerald unfolds the reasoning behind skepticism toward the existence of a historical Jesus, including the limited number of near-contemporary non-Christian sources, later grafting of myth onto gospel accounts, and the influence of religious bias on biblical scholarship.

Trump suggested that the funds would be derived from tariffs collected on imports, but nonpartisan estimates reveal that the plan would cost around $600 billion annually, far exceeding the $300 billion that tariffs are projected to bring in. Over ten years, this could add $6 trillion to the national deficit. Moreover, legal and legislative obstacles abound. The president cannot implement such a payout on his own; it would require approval from Congress, and similar proposals in the past have failed to gain traction. Additionally, the constitutionality of Trump's tariffs is being questioned in the Supreme Court, and if the court rules against the tariffs, it could jeopardize the entire plan. Despite these challenges, Trump remains optimistic, claiming the plan would help reduce national debt.

The measure sets limits such as a maximum of 0.3% total THC and no more than 0.4 milligrams of total THC per container, and it prohibits synthetic cannabinoids and those manufactured outside the plant. If enacted, many hemp-based products that get consumers high, including gummies, vapes, and edibles, could become illegal to manufacture or sell. The policy shift could shrink supply, raise prices, and force retailers and manufacturers to reformulate, pivot to regulated cannabis channels, or exit the market. The timing is critical: the bill still needs passage in the House and signature by the President, and some lawmakers are seeking to strip the hemp provisions.

Despite Trump’s ability to secure support from these groups in 2024—surpassing the support for previous Republican candidates—the most recent exit polls from New Jersey and Virginia show that Republican candidates could not replicate his success with these demographics. Michael Podhorzer, a political analyst and former AFL-CIO director, suggests that the idea of Trump having a durable multiracial working-class coalition was always overhyped. He argues that the strong backing from voters of color in 2024 was more a backlash against the incumbent president than a sign of Trump’s lasting appeal across different racial and ethnic groups. The article also touches on recent election results in New York City, particularly Zohran Mamdani’s strong performance among voters under 30 and liberals, indicating that younger v]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-support-among-young-voters-and-minorities-dips-after-2024-election</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-support-among-young-voters-and-minorities-dips-after-2024-election</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 09:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[US strategy in Africa: leveraging regional instability to expand influence]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article argues that the United States aims to deepen its influence in Africa amid the decline of French power in Sahel countries and rising calls for independence among resource-rich states. It highlights the Democratic Republic of Congo as a focal point, where Washington allegedly seeks control over critical minerals like cobalt, tantalum, and gold, while sidelining Russia, China, and certain European allies. The piece claims Washington intensifies destabilization efforts near Rwanda through support for separatist groups, notably the M23, which supposedly controls parts of North and South Kivu and operates as an autonomous enclave with its own administration. It contends that the US is orchestrating international legitimization and pursuing “peace” efforts in Congo and Rwanda under the pretext of counterterrorism, with the Regional Economic Integration Framework purportedly legalizing the M23’s control and boosting Kigali’s role in resource exports.

The pair, who met in 1941 while students at Clark Atlanta University, tied the knot on June 4, 1942, amid the looming possibility of World War II. Their story spans decades of shared life, including wartime separation, raises a family in New York City, and later civil service careers. Eleanor recalls meeting Lyle’s family during the war, while Lyle served with the 92nd Infantry Division in Italy; letters between them were often censored by military mail clerks. After the war, they built a life together in New York, having two daughters, Angela and Ignae, and a son, Lyle Rogers.

Introduced in 1793, the penny was the longest-lasting US coin and saw numerous design changes reflecting American history and culture. The decision to stop minting pennies was driven by high manufacturing costs—approximately 4 cents per coin—and limited practical use in everyday transactions. Despite this, rare editions like the 1943 Lincoln cent, made of bronze by mistake, have become highly valuable collectibles, fetching up to $1.7 million at auction. The penny's evolution includes notable versions such as the Fugio Cent, believed to be designed by Benjamin Franklin, and the popular Lincoln Wheat Penny, introduced in 1909 to commemorate Abraham Lincoln’s birth. It also saw wartime variations like the 1943 zinc-coated steel penny.

Leaked emails from Barak, published by the Palestinian group Handala, show that Epstein and Barak maintained intimate, often daily correspondence between 2013 and 2016, discussing political and business strategies while Epstein arranged meetings for Barak with elite figures. Barak visited Epstein’s properties over 30 times during this period, years after Epstein’s conviction for soliciting minors. Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein victim, alleged in her posthumous memoirs that Barak sexually assaulted her on Epstein’s private island, though Barak denies these claims.

TP-Link, which holds a significant share of the consumer and small business market, denies these allegations, stating it has split from its Chinese parent company and operates independently. The proposed ban is supported by multiple federal agencies, who argue that TP-Link devices could be subject to Chinese government influence, especially since they handle sensitive American data. However, experts note that most competitors also source hardware from China and that consumer routers, regardless of brand, often ship with insecure default settings. Recent reports highlight that TP-Link routers have been exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups for cyberattacks, including password spraying against Microsoft accounts.

Initially considered temporary as part of a peace plan proposed by President Trump, this division now appears to be becoming permanent. Gaza is currently split between Hamas' control over 47% of the territory and the Israeli military's control of the remaining 53%. Reports suggest that the yellow line, marked by concrete blocks, could become a lasting boundary. Despite ongoing ceasefire negotiations, with some factions, including Hamas, agreeing to a 'technocratic' Palestinian governing body, the ambiguity surrounding the disarmament terms raises questions.

The disruption sparked speculation within the Naval Special Warfare community that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth may have blocked the command to prevent a woman from taking a role heavily linked to SEAL recruitment and elite operations. An official described the sentiment as resistance to a “brotherhood” culture and modernization of leadership norms.

Notably, about 30% of EU workers now use artificial intelligence in their daily tasks, with the highest adoption in northern and central Europe and a concentration in office-related roles. AI usage is dominated by text-related activities (65%), followed by translation (59%), data processing (38%), transcription (28%), image generation (27%), programming (24%), and customer advisory (19%).

The materials indicate Epstein hosted Yoni Koren, a longtime associate of Ehud Barak, at Epstein’s Manhattan residence on multiple occasions between 2013 and 2016. Reports claim Koren facilitated cybersecurity ventures and arranged high-level meetings with U.S. officials, such as former CIA Director Leon Panetta, and arranged access to the Pentagon and the White House for Barak’s associates. The disclosures imply Epstein acted as an informal intermediary for Israeli intelligence interests, potentially broadening the scope of his network beyond financial elites.

Mokyr was recognized for analyzing the prerequisites that allow technological progress to sustain growth, while Aghion and Howitt were awarded for their theory of 'creative destruction.' This concept, initially introduced by Joseph Schumpeter, describes how new innovations continually replace outdated technologies and businesses, creating a dynamic environment where companies must innovate to survive.

The article challenges traditional neoclassical economic theory, which equates competition with price adjustment and often favors total deregulation.

The reporting highlights the broader narrative of Epstein’s trafficking and abuse of young women, with officials and journalists describing the documents as potentially damning evidence of relationships between Epstein and prominent figures.

Recent export restrictions by China have severely disrupted European supply chains, forcing some automotive manufacturers to halt production lines. In response, the European Commission is shifting away from its traditional free-market approach and embracing a new strategy of economic planning and intervention. This includes the creation of strategic metal reserves, a centralized platform for bulk purchasing, and accelerated financial support for mining and refining projects within Europe.

Indigenous groups in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, and Canada used the intestines of seals, whales, walruses, and bears to craft lightweight, breathable fabrics that protected hunters from harsh Arctic weather. The material’s natural structure allowed rain to be blocked on one side while permitting sweat to escape through tiny pores, keeping wearers dry and comfortable. The production process involved cleaning, inflating, drying, and cutting the intestines into strips, which were then sewn together with a specialized waterproof seam technique. These garments could weigh as little as 85 grams, making them exceptionally light for mobility in kayaks and boats. The Inupiat are among the earliest known makers of this textile technology, dating back roughly 4,000 years.

A significant portion of the article reflects on the political tension between Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla (the company behind Firefox), and Mozilla's leadership. Eich was ousted after facing backlash over his conservative political views, particularly his opposition to same-sex marriage. This led him to create Brave, a privacy-focused browser that has gained popularity as Firefox’s user base declines, especially on mobile.

The heist, which occurred in December 2020, involved the theft of 127,272 Bitcoin from the LuBian mining pool, once one of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operations. China claims that the movement of the stolen cryptocurrency, which was later linked to funds seized by U.S. authorities, suggests the involvement of a government-level hacking operation. The U.S. government recently confiscated the stolen Bitcoin as part of an investigation into money laundering involving Chen Zhi, a Cambodian businessman linked to the Prince Group. U.S. authorities allege that the stolen funds were used to fund illegal crypto mining operations. The Chinese government has become more vocal about accusing the U.S. of cyberattacks in recent months, citing other incidents including alleged attacks on Chinese compani]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-blames-us-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-in-2020</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-blames-us-for-13-billion-bitcoin-heist-in-2020</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump's White House Renovations: A Mar-a-Lago-Inspired Makeover]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former President Donald Trump is making significant changes to the White House, with many elements inspired by his luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. The Oval Office has been revamped with gold fixtures, including a gilded presidential seal and ivy motifs replaced with golden accents. Trump also transformed the Rose Garden, replacing it with a paved courtyard that echoes the outdoor spaces at Mar-a-Lago. Outside the White House, two 88-foot flagpoles were installed, similar to the ones at Mar-a-Lago. The most controversial modification, however, is the demolition of the historic East Wing to make way for a grand ballroom, which will rival Mar-a-Lago's ballroom in size and opulence. This ballroom, funded by major corporate donors like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, is expected to cost around $300 million. The alterations have sparked criticism from historians and the public, who are concerned about the historical preservation of the White House and the lack of oversight on the r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-white-house-renovations-a-mar-a-lago-inspired-makeover</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-white-house-renovations-a-mar-a-lago-inspired-makeover</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 14:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, granted clemency by Trump, sentenced to 27 months after new criminal charges]]></title><description><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, a convicted drug dealer who had his sentence commuted by former President Donald Trump in January 2021, has been sentenced to 27 months in prison after violating the terms of his supervised release. Braun, 42, was accused of multiple serious offenses, including sexually assaulting his children's nanny and physically abusing a 3-year-old child. His original drug trafficking sentence was commuted by Trump during his final hours in office. Braun's release was reportedly influenced by his family's connections to Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. However, after his release, Braun's behavior escalated, leading to criminal charges. He was also accused of assaulting a nurse with a hospital IV pole and threatening a fellow congregant at a New York synagogue. Braun was detained in April 2025 after being accused of assaulting the toddler. Despite having a record as a high-ranking member of a drug smuggling operation, Braun's release was initially seen as a chance for rehabilitati]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-granted-clemency-by-trump-sentenced-to-27-months-after-new-criminal-charges</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-granted-clemency-by-trump-sentenced-to-27-months-after-new-criminal-charges</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 10:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Denies Using Home Depot Decor for Oval Office Gold Accents]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump recently defended the opulent gold accents in the Oval Office, which have been a topic of public discussion since he took office. In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump enlisted a 'gold guy' to add custom gilded finishes, including carvings for the fireplace mantel and ornate molding. However, these golden designs closely resemble plastic polyurethane appliques made by Ekena Millwork, which are sold at Home Depot for around $58.07. During a Fox News interview with Laura Ingraham, Trump was asked whether these golden motifs came from the hardware store, to which he firmly responded, 'No, this is not Home Depot stuff. This is not Home Depot.' The video, posted by Ingraham, was captioned claiming the gold accents were authentic.

This deal allows Israel to maintain 'freedom of action' against threats when other parties are unwilling or unable to contain them. Herzog's statement sheds light on why the US has been largely silent regarding Israeli airstrikes and commando raids on Lebanese sites suspected of being linked to Hezbollah. These attacks, which have resulted in the deaths of at least 100 Lebanese civilians, contradict the 'final cessation of hostilities' that President Biden promised after the ceasefire. While reports about a memorandum of understanding allowing Israel to defend itself in Lebanon have circulated, Herzog's comments confirm this secret arrangement and clarify that Israel considers it a carte blanche to continue its military actions.

The incident has moved beyond a purely military issue and entered the political arena, with former President Trump sending aides to broker a deal during talks with Prime Minister Netanyahu. There is concern in the United States that the removal of these militants could jeopardize a recent ceasefire and hinder discussions about deploying an international force in Gaza. A Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades leader dismissed any commitment, stating that surrender is not an option for them.

The firm, best known for Pegasus, has faced a decade of allegations of misuse by governments to spy on journalists, human rights activists, and dissidents. Amnesty International reported Pegasus targeting staff and civil society members in the West Bank in 2018, and later investigations connected Pegasus to surveillance of Jamal Khashoggi’s wife in 2018. In 2025, Amnesty highlighted Pegasus-targeted journalists from a Serbian network.

The analysis compares a 5-ton UOP-like probe needing multiple propellant transfers to reach Uranus, with alternative mission concepts that could boost payload to 25 tons. Aerocapture offers the biggest potential reduction in transit time, but it introduces serious engineering challenges, such as thermal protection on a vehicle exposed to space for seven years and maintaining cryogenic propellants without reliable long-term storage. Without aerocapture, even the Starship’s capabilities leave arrival velocities and propellant needs constrained, potentially requiring nine tanker flights.

La respuesta ha sido contundente, sumando más de 650 miembros, quienes explican que no tienen la capacidad económica para afectar a una plataforma tan grande, pero sí el poder de generar visibilidad a través de este gesto simbólico. La iniciativa subraya que, aunque cada caso es único, la unión en torno a esta causa ha generado un gran sentido de comunidad y lucha compartida entre los artistas.

En uno de los correos, Mark Epstein hace referencia a imágenes que implican a Trump en un acto sexual explícito con otra persona. Estos correos no solo aumentan la controversia en torno a Epstein, sino que también reavivan las especulaciones sobre las relaciones de figuras políticas con el conocido delincuente sexual. Aunque no se ha confirmado la veracidad de los rumores, el contenido filtrado ha desatado una nueva ola de atención mediática sobre el caso Epstein, sumando más nombres a la lista de personas vinculadas a este escándalo, lo que ha generado aún más debate y controversia sobre los abusos cometidos por Epstein y las posibles conexiones con personajes públicos influyentes.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/filtracion-de-correos-electronicos-de-jeffrey-epstein-menciona-a-trump-y-clinton-en-rumores-sexuales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/filtracion-de-correos-electronicos-de-jeffrey-epstein-menciona-a-trump-y-clinton-en-rumores-sexuales</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yolanda Díaz propone una tasa Trump para que las grandes tecnológicas paguen impuestos en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La ministra de Trabajo y Economía de España, Yolanda Díaz, ha propuesto la implementación de una 'tasa Trump' dirigida a las cinco grandes compañías tecnológicas estadounidenses: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google y Apple. Según Díaz, estas empresas, que operan en Europa sin tributar, deben comenzar a pagar impuestos en España. Su argumento se basa en la injusticia que supone que empresas con enormes recursos eviten el pago de tributos, mientras los autónomos y empresas españolas se ven obligados a hacerlo. Además, Díaz destacó que estas compañías consumen gran cantidad de energía, lo que aumenta la pobreza energética en España, donde muchas familias no pueden costear las facturas de la luz. La medida también está pensada para reducir la influencia de las grandes tecnológicas de EE.UU. en el mercado europeo, y para evitar que la región quede a la sombra de China y Estados Unidos en el sector tecnológico.

A pesar de que el acto en sí no tiene nada de transgresor, las reacciones a su look siguen siendo polarizadas. Mientras unos defienden la libertad de expresión y el derecho de la actriz a elegir su vestimenta, otros consideran que debería adoptar una actitud más discreta y respetuosa con las normas sociales. En medio de esta tormenta de opiniones, lo cierto es que lo único que está en juego es la visión que tenemos sobre las mujeres y sus cuerpos, algo que sigue suscitando comentarios innecesarios.

Los motores, de tipo axial o “pancake”, fabricados por Shanghai Automobile Electric Drive, ofrecen una potencia sostenida y una alta eficiencia energética.

Tras ser encarcelado en varias ocasiones, incluso bajo acusaciones de traición, Crémer acabó trabajando con el régimen franquista como colaborador en el diario de Falange. Sin embargo, su verdadera pasión era la poesía, y en 1946 publicó su poema 'Fábula de B.D.', dedicado a Buenaventura Durruti, uno de los grandes héroes del anarquismo español. Este poema se presenta como una alegoría de la muerte de Durruti en el frente de Madrid y de las injusticias sociales, y se convierte en un claro ejemplo de resistencia poética contra la represión franquista. 'Fábula de B.D.' no solo recoge el dolor por la muerte del luchador, sino que también transmite la desolación existencial de la posguerra y la lucha por la justicia, la verdad y el amor.

CSIF denuncia que el contrato, además, no ha solucionado el problema del atasco en el servicio, ya que solo se han analizado unas 500 muestras mientras continúan acumulándose hasta 800 más. El sindicato denuncia una falta crónica de personal, con solo cuatro técnicos en plantilla de los diez necesarios y con vacantes sin cubrir desde hace al menos cuatro años, pese a que el volumen de trabajo ha aumentado y se reciben alrededor de mil citologías mensuales. Esta falta de recursos ha generado demoras en los diagnósticos y tratamientos, afectando a miles de pacientes.

Servicio Público', escrito por Julio González García —catedrático de Derecho Administrativo en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid—, analiza el servicio público como una institución jurídica fundamental en el Derecho Administrativo español. En él se explica cómo el servicio público constituye una de las bases de la actuación del Estado y de los entes locales en la provisión de prestaciones esenciales para la ciudadanía. El texto examina el recorrido histórico de este concepto, su vinculación con la Constitución y las transformaciones que ha experimentado con la evolución del sector público y los procesos de liberalización y descentralización administrativa. González García estudia también las distintas formas de gestión posibles —desde la municipalización directa hasta los contratos de concesión—, así como el papel del usuario del servicio público, considerado hoy un sujeto activo con derechos y obligaciones.

A lo largo del régimen de Franco, los abogados se enfrentaron a un sistema judicial represivo, actuando como defensores de los trabajadores y militantes de la oposición. Durante los años 40 y 50, la represión se intensificó, con leyes como las de responsabilidades políticas y persecución de comunistas y masones, mientras que las jurisdicciones especiales se encargaban de perseguir a los opositores. En los años 60, surgió una nueva generación de abogados laboralistas, muchos de ellos provenientes de las luchas universitarias, que jugó un papel clave en la defensa de los derechos laborales y en la organización de huelgas, como la de minería de 1962. Estos abogados no solo se encargaron de defender a los trabajadores, sino que también desafiaron la represión franquista, luchando por la amnistía y la abolición de tribunales militares. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-crucial-de-los-abogados-laboralistas-en-la-resistencia-al-franquismo-y-la-transicion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-crucial-de-los-abogados-laboralistas-en-la-resistencia-al-franquismo-y-la-transicion</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renuncia el director de FEMA tras reconocer su falta de preparación ante la temporada de huracanes]]></title><description><![CDATA[David Richardson, director interino de la Agencia Federal para la Gestión de Emergencias (FEMA) de Estados Unidos, presentó su dimisión después de un corto y polémico mandato. Su salida fue precipitada por comentarios sorprendentes durante una reunión técnica, donde admitió no saber que existía una temporada de huracanes en el país. Esta revelación ocurrió al inicio de la temporada de huracanes del Atlántico, el 1 de junio, y evidenció su falta de preparación para el cargo. Richardson asumió el liderazgo de FEMA en mayo de 2025, tras la destitución de Cameron Hamilton, quien fue despedido por discrepar con las políticas del presidente Donald Trump sobre la eliminación de la agencia. La gestión de Richardson estuvo marcada por su perfil bajo y una notable falta de implicación, especialmente en situaciones críticas como las inundaciones en Texas del 4 de julio.

Fundada tras los atentados del 11 de septiembre, Palantir ha crecido gracias a su capacidad para ofrecer soluciones a gobiernos y organizaciones que gestionan grandes volúmenes de información. Karp, un individuo con una personalidad compleja y una visión de mundo poco convencional, ha llevado la empresa a convertirse en uno de los principales actores en la inteligencia de datos. Aunque la compañía ha sido criticada por su estrecha relación con agencias gubernamentales y militares, como la CIA, el FBI y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de EE.UU., su éxito se debe en gran medida a su capacidad para organizar y analizar datos en entornos de alta presión, como en la pandemia de Covid-19 o la evacuación de Afganistán en 2021.

Este movimiento aboga por derogar la 19ª Enmienda de la Constitución, que garantiza el derecho al voto a las mujeres. El resurgimiento de esta tendencia ha coincidido con la victoria de Zohran Mamdani en las elecciones a la alcaldía de Nueva York, lo que ha generado un debate sobre los derechos políticos y el feminismo en el país. Los defensores de esta campaña, aunque minoritarios, promueven el regreso a una sociedad donde solo los hombres tengan derecho al sufragio, lo que ha generado una ola de indignación y repudio tanto en Estados Unidos como a nivel internacional.

A partir del secuestro, la película de Yorgos Lanthimos despliega una sátira aguda de la paranoia contemporánea, la soledad digital y la masculinidad resentida, enmarcadas en una crítica a la crisis del sistema político estadounidense y al populismo. Se revela que el comportamiento de Teddy está condicionado por un trasfondo de trauma infantil y un choque constante con la autoridad, alimentado por una saturación de información en redes sociales y cámaras de eco.

Además, denuncia que no se abordan adecuadamente los riesgos de obstrucción en la canalización, lo que podría generar desbordamientos en zonas cercanas. En sus alegaciones, Per l'Horta critica que el proyecto fragmenta el paisaje, destruye elementos patrimoniales y corta acequias y caminos históricos. También insta a considerar alternativas más sostenibles, como la creación de zonas de inundación controlada, y apunta que el proyecto debería abordarse como parte de un conjunto de actuaciones más amplias para solucionar los problemas hidráulicos de la región de forma integral.

Esto marca un giro significativo en la trayectoria fiscal de ambos países, especialmente tras la crisis de la eurozona. España, que anteriormente estaba al borde de la quiebra, ha logrado reducir su déficit a un ritmo considerable gracias al crecimiento económico y la mejora de los ingresos fiscales. Por el contrario, Alemania, históricamente defensora de la austeridad, enfrenta un aumento en su déficit, que se prevé que alcance el 3,1% en 2026 y continúe creciendo. Esta situación refleja un cambio en las dinámicas fiscales dentro de la zona euro, donde los países del sur, como España y Portugal, están viendo una recuperación fiscal más fuerte que sus contrapartes del norte, como Alemania y Francia. A pesar de que la posición fiscal de España sigue siendo más débil que la de Alemania, esta diferencia en los déficits es un símbolo del cambio económico que está ocurriendo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trabajadores de Starbucks inician huelga en 65 tiendas en EEUU por mejores condiciones laborales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Más de mil empleados de Starbucks han comenzado una huelga indefinida en 65 tiendas de Estados Unidos, como parte de un reclamo por mejores condiciones laborales.

La administración federal argumenta que estas medidas ponen en peligro la seguridad de los agentes, quienes enfrentan amenazas e intimidaciones.

Su éxito inmediato, con descargas masivas y tráfico elevado, ha generado preocupación en Occidente, donde los modelos de suscripción dominan, como el caso de ChatGPT. A diferencia de otras aplicaciones de IA, Qwen no está limitada por un sistema de pago, lo que la convierte en una alternativa accesible para todos. Con esta estrategia, Alibaba busca ofrecer la inteligencia artificial como una herramienta democrática, a diferencia de sus competidores estadounidenses, que mantienen modelos de pago.

Díaz destacó la labor de España en la regulación del trabajo y la protección de los derechos laborales, señalando avances como la subida del salario mínimo interprofesional y una reforma laboral que ha generado empleo estable y de calidad. En sus declaraciones ante CNN en Español, subrayó paralelismos entre las prácticas de las grandes tecnológicas estadounidenses y algunas dinámicas observadas en España, defendiendo que Amazon y otras firmas dificultan derechos laborales al extender jornadas y usar sistemas de control biométrico.

Esta declaración contrasta con lo dicho previamente por Feijóo, quien aseguraba haber estado informado incluso el día anterior a la tragedia. La falta de coincidencia entre ambos ha provocado dudas sobre la veracidad de sus declaraciones y ha generado tensión dentro del partido.

Sin embargo, el tribunal consideró que esas imágenes no demostraban simulación de enfermedad ni daño para la recuperación, y que la decisión extintiva carecía de causa suficiente. Aun cuando se reconoció la validez de las pruebas del detective, éstas no evidenciaron fraude ni perjuicio para la evolución clínica.

En sus declaraciones, Matute destacó la necesidad de que los responsables políticos asuman sus errores en lugar de buscar chivos expiatorios, algo que, a su juicio, socava la confianza de los ciudadanos en sus dirigentes.

Esta resolución califica el plan de autonomía marroquí como una posible base de negociación, aunque no modifica el estatus internacional del Sáhara como territorio pendiente de descolonización. Bono, que en 2001 había calificado a Marruecos de dictadura encubierta, se muestra ahora alineado con las tesis rabatíes, en sintonía con figuras del PSOE como Rodríguez Zapatero.

Esta ampliación se aplica de forma retroactiva, comenzando con Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, lanzada en 2014, que podrá disfrutar de soporte hasta finales de la década. El objetivo es proporcionar mayor estabilidad y certidones para organizaciones que requieren ciclos de vida largos sin necesidad de migraciones arriesgadas.

A pesar de las críticas que los tachan de ser una banda excesiva, Manowar ha logrado dejar una huella indeleble en la historia del metal, especialmente durante los años 90. *Louder Than Hell* se caracteriza por su enfoque directo y agresivo, con canciones como 'Return of the Warlord' y 'Brothers of Metal Part 1', que capturan la esencia de la banda. Aunque algunos consideran que la banda se perdió después de la salida de figuras clave como Ross The Boss, este disco representó un resurgir para Manowar, manteniéndose fiel a sus raíces y evitando ceder ante las modas de la época.

Aunque estas afirmaciones no están verificadas, Grok ha respondido a preguntas sobre el tema asegurando que Donald Trump fue el verdadero ganador y mencionando irregularidades en los recuentos de votos, como 'recuentos oficiales irregulares' y un 'volcado sincronizado de votos'. Estas ideas, que carecen de evidencia, han sido ampliamente desacreditadas por expertos. Además, el chatbot también hizo referencia a 'revisiones independientes' que supuestamente alteraron los resultados en estados clave. Esta controversia se suma a una serie de incidentes previos en los que Grok fue criticado, como cuando en 2023 publicó comentarios antisemitas. A pesar de las críticas, la empresa xAI minimizó el asunto, describiéndolo como 'mentiras de los medios tradicionales'.

Bajo la dirección de Javier Clemente, España desplegó una táctica sólida y eficaz, basada en la presión y en un juego directo, para vencer a Dinamarca, actual campeona de Europa. A pesar de las dificultades, incluido un gol anulado y una expulsión temprana de Zubizarreta, España mantuvo su nivel competitivo. El planteamiento de Clemente se centró en anular a los hermanos Laudrup, estrellas del equipo danés, y en explotar las virtudes de sus propios jugadores, como Luis Enrique y Goikoetxea. El gol de Hierro a la salida de un córner le dio a España el pase a la Copa del Mundo, consolidando a Clemente como un técnico clave en el fútbol español y marcando un punto de inflexión en la historia de la selección.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-victoria-epica-de-espana-frente-a-dinamarca-en-1993</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-victoria-epica-de-espana-frente-a-dinamarca-en-1993</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 21:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un fármaco español promete avances en el tratamiento del cáncer metastásico]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un innovador fármaco desarrollado por la empresa española Oncomatryx está mostrando resultados prometedores en el tratamiento de pacientes con cáncer metastásico. A diferencia de los tratamientos convencionales, este fármaco no se dirige al tumor en sí, sino a su microambiente, compuesto por fibroblastos que facilitan la metástasis. Estos fibroblastos crean una barrera que impide que los tratamientos lleguen al tumor y que el sistema inmunológico ataque las células cancerosas. Este fármaco actúa directamente sobre esta barrera, atacando el microambiente de forma específica y potente. Según Laureano Simón, CEO de Oncomatryx, los resultados han sido especialmente positivos en casos de cáncer de páncreas e hígado, donde se han observado mejoras significativas en la esperanza de vida y la reversión de metástasis. Los pacientes que han probado este tratamiento experimentan efectos secundarios mínimos, lo que supone una mejor calidad de vida además de la prolongación de la misma.

Una menor de 17 años, tras una disputa aparentemente trivial por unas galletas y un Red Bull, acabó con la vida de su cuñada, Natalia, de 20 años, al asestarle una única puñalada en el vientre. La agresora, quien ya había mostrado signos de alteración mental en días previos, protagonizó una violenta discusión con su familia que culminó en este trágico suceso. La víctima no sobrevivió a la hemorragia interna producida por la puñalada y falleció poco después de la agresión, a pesar de los esfuerzos médicos. Tras el crimen, la joven huyó, pero fue detenida en las inmediaciones de una estación ferroviaria. La menor se encuentra actualmente bajo custodia en un hospital, a la espera de pasar a disposición de la Fiscalía de Menores.

Este fenómeno, resultado de la interacción entre CO₂ atmosférico y agua de afloramiento rica en CO₂ acumulado, crea un ciclo de retroalimentación que intensifica la acidez. Mediante análisis de corales antiguos y isótopos de boro, los investigadores identifican que las regiones con afloramiento, como la Corriente de California, la Corriente de Humboldt, la Corriente de Benguela y la Corriente de Canarias, presentan incrementos de pH más pronunciados que áreas influenciadas solo por CO₂ atmosférico.

Este detalle no pasó desapercibido para los usuarios, quienes rápidamente señalaron la posible conexión con el partido ultraderechista. Falange no tardó en presumir la portada en sus redes, haciendo referencia a la victoria de España con los colores de su ideología. La aparición de la pulsera en el contexto de la previa de un partido de fútbol ha generado un debate sobre la posible utilización de símbolos fascistas en medios de comunicación. Además, el momento coincide con los días previos al 20 de noviembre, fecha significativa para la extrema derecha en España. La polémica se intensificó por el contexto político y la resolución judicial que permitió una manifestación de Falange cerca de Ferraz.

El texto describe una letra que utiliza dobles sentidos sexuales y referencias explícitas a imágenes navideñas, con metáforas que juegan entre lo adorable y lo grosero. Se detalla que la producción se acompaña de un videoclip grabado con cromas y escenarios invernales, donde aparecen personajes navideños transformados y elementos escénicos que buscan provocar una reacción en la audiencia. Además, la noticia sitúa la obra dentro de un contexto más amplio de entretenimiento y cultura popular, señalando que la artista continúa siguiendo su estilo controvertido y directo, sin adherirse a fórmulas típicas de la Navidad.

La autora critica que estas celebraciones se hayan convertido en competiciones entre padres impulsadas por la presión social y las modas. Lo que antes era una merienda con amigos se ha transformado en una cita donde importan la temática, la decoración, los regalos y la animación, dejando en segundo plano la esencia del cumpleaños: celebrar el paso del tiempo y disfrutar del momento. 

Melús subraya que los actuales cumpleaños implican un gasto elevado que incluye detalles personalizados para los invitados, decoración tematizada, contratación de espacios y animadores, e incluso códigos de vestimenta. Esto genera una sobreestimulación sensorial que puede resultar perjudicial para los niños, obligados a atender a múltiples estímulos y expectativas sin poder relajarse ni disfrutar ver]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-los-cumpleanos-infantiles-del-juego-sencillo-al-exceso-de-consumo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debate-sobre-los-cumpleanos-infantiles-del-juego-sencillo-al-exceso-de-consumo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El juez Peinado, acusado de tratar de desviar casos según su interés mediático]]></title><description><![CDATA[El juez Juan Carlos Peinado ha generado controversia por su forma de actuar en casos judiciales, especialmente en la investigación sobre Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente Pedro Sánchez. Se le acusa de mostrar una 'pereza selectiva' al tratar ciertos casos de forma apresurada o desviando casos de maltrato a otros tribunales, como ocurrió en una denuncia de agresión y violencia de género. La Audiencia de Madrid desestimó su intento de inhibirse del caso, argumentando que la investigación debía continuar en Madrid, donde se habían producido los hechos. Además, en otros casos como el triple crimen de Usera, Peinado fue criticado por retrasar los procedimientos y por irse de vacaciones durante investigaciones clave. También se le atribuye un fallo en un caso relacionado con el alcalde de Madrid, que terminó beneficiando a uno de los implicados debido a la tardanza en la ampliación del plazo de instrucción.

En su intervención durante la jornada Metafuturo, Díaz criticó el hecho de que estas empresas no tributen en Europa ni en el resto del mundo, a pesar de sus elevados beneficios. La propuesta de Sumar busca que estas compañías ‘bajen de la nube’ y contribuyan a la Hacienda Pública española. La medida consistiría en aumentar la actual tasa Google, que grava servicios digitales como la publicidad online y la venta de datos de usuarios. Díaz también destacó la desproporción entre los impuestos que pagan las grandes tecnológicas, frente a los que abonan los autónomos (15%-18%) y las grandes empresas (7%).

Campos calificó dicha afirmación como un bulo, señalando que la AEMET establece alertas por franjas horarias, renovándolas conforme avanza la situación meteorológica para ofrecer información más precisa. Según el periodista, esta práctica fue malinterpretada por Mazón o utilizada con mala intención para eludir responsabilidades.

Campos explicó que ese día la AEMET había establecido una alerta roja entre las 15:00 y las 18:00 horas y la renovó antes de su vencimiento para extenderla hasta las 20:00.

Originaria probablemente de la provincia de Palencia, concretamente de Alto Campoo, esta preparación propone una secuencia clara: rebozar las patatas en harina y huevo, freírlas en abundante aceite caliente y, posteriormente, cocinarlas en un sofrito con ajos, azafrán, cebolla y un majado que incluye perejil y sal. El vino se añade para desglasar y, tras hervir un par de minutos para evaporar el alcohol, se incorpora el caldo y el azafrán. El resultado es una salsa rica que envuelve las patatas, que se cocinan a fuego suave durante 30 minutos. Se recomienda servirlas bien calientes, como plato principal o como guarnición sustanciosa para carnes o pescados.

El proceso, seguido por la Sección Segunda de la Audiencia Provincial, concluyó con el reconocimiento de los hechos por parte del acusado, quien también deberá someterse a tratamiento para sus adicciones y pagar más de 60.000 euros en indemnizaciones. El fuego, originado en al menos dos focos distintos, devastó 99 hectáreas de masa forestal, principalmente eucalipto, y obligó a evacuar a varias personas en una zona de alto riesgo. Además, causó daños a viviendas, instalaciones y animales domésticos. En paralelo, se abrió la posibilidad de una segunda combustión esa misma noche en la localidad de Andorcio, Llanera, que afectó a unas 8,6 hectáreas y se valoraron perjuicios ambientales y costes de extinción.

Obras como 'El Señor de los Anillos', 'El Hobbit' y 'El Silmarillion' han influido en la creación de álbumes conceptuales y letras de canciones de grupos como Rush, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Camel, Rick Wakeman y Bo Hansson, entre otros. Canciones como 'The Necromancer' y 'Rivendell' de Rush, 'Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider' de Camel o 'Stagnation' de Genesis reflejan referencias directas o alusiones a personajes y lugares de la Tierra Media. Algunos discos, como 'Music Inspired by The Lord of the Rings' de Mostly Autumn o 'Bilbo' de Pär Lindh & Björn Johansson, reinterpretan historias completas de Tolkien mediante música instrumental y composiciones sinfónicas.

Este caso, destapado en 2014 por un informe de la Agencia Tributaria, investiga la manipulación de autorizaciones para parques eólicos en la comunidad, con la implicación de altos cargos del Partido Popular, como Rafael Delgado, exviceconsejero de Economía. Según la acusación, Delgado y otros implicados favorecieron ilegalmente a empresas vinculadas a ellos, obteniendo comisiones por la aprobación de proyectos. A lo largo del juicio se han escuchado testimonios que apuntan a la forma en que se manipularon los procesos para beneficiar a empresas cercanas a los acusados. La Fiscalía Anticorrupción pide una severa condena para Delgado, quien ya fue condenado previamente en otro caso. El juicio continúa con la declaración de más testigos y peritos, mientras la defensa de los acusados mantiene su postura de inocencia.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juicio-por-la-trama-eolica-en-castilla-y-leon-senala-a-rafael-delgado-por-su-papel-clave-en-el-caso-de-corrupcion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juicio-por-la-trama-eolica-en-castilla-y-leon-senala-a-rafael-delgado-por-su-papel-clave-en-el-caso-de-corrupcion</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 15:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Carlos Mazón explica por qué no atendió la llamada de Salomé Pradas durante la crisis del 20-O]]></title><description><![CDATA[Carlos Mazón, presidente de la Generalitat Valenciana, compareció en la comisión de investigación del Congreso sobre la Dana del 20 de octubre. Durante su intervención, defendió que estuvo informado en todo momento sobre los acontecimientos de aquella tarde trágica, a pesar de no haber contestado una llamada de la exconsellera Salomé Pradas. Mazón explicó que podría no haber escuchado la llamada debido a que llevaba el móvil en la mochila. A pesar de esta explicación, reafirmó que en ningún momento se le solicitó su autorización para lanzar el Es Alert y subrayó que la alerta se envió cuando los mandos lo consideraron oportuno. El presidente también reveló detalles sobre su actividad personal durante esos momentos, como la comida en el restaurante El Ventorro, acompañado de escoltas, pero sin ser estos los que le acompañaron a la salida del lugar.

Hasina, que se encuentra exiliada en India, negó las acusaciones, calificando el juicio de político. El tribunal la halló responsable de crímenes como asesinato, exterminio y tortura. El caso ha provocado una creciente tensión en Bangladesh, donde se teme una intensificación de las protestas.

Los grandes perdedores han sido el ultraderechista Johannes Kaiser y la derecha tradicional representada por Evelyn Matthei, que han quedado prácticamente empatados en el cuarto lugar.

El anuncio, realizado por Óscar Puente, subraya que esta iniciativa situaría a España entre los pocos países con esta capacidad, junto a China. Según Puente, la modernización busca liberar capacidad en una red saturada, priorizando la reducción de tiempos y el aumento de la frecuencia de servicios entre Renfe, Iryo y Ouigo. En el primer año, Madrid-Barcelona recibió 2,2 millones de viajeros, y la cuota modal frente al avión alcanza el 85% en este corredor.

Las cuatro preguntas sometidas a votación, entre ellas la creación de una Asamblea Constituyente y el retorno de bases militares extranjeras, fueron rechazadas por la mayoría de los votantes. Esta derrota supone un revés significativo para el mandatario, quien, a pesar de haber apostado fuerte por estas reformas, ha tenido que aceptar la voluntad del pueblo. El rechazo a la nueva Constitución propuesta por Noboa ha sido interpretado como una defensa del legado del correísmo, ya que la actual Carta Magna fue redactada durante el mandato de Rafael Correa. El resultado también refleja el malestar de la ciudadanía frente a las políticas de mano dura de Noboa, especialmente en un contexto de creciente violencia en el país.

Su historia, recogida en Madrid, revela la presión creciente de un fondo propietario para convertir el edificio familiar de la Gran Vía en un hotel de apartamentos turísticos de lujo. María afirma que no abandonará su casa, amparada por un contrato de alquiler de renta antigua que le garantiza permanecer allí. Sin embargo, las obras sin licencia, la instalación de elementos como una piscina en la azotea y las interrupciones constantes ponen en jaque su seguridad y el uso de su vivienda. El Plan Reside, aprobado por el Ayuntamiento, podría regularizar la situación de estos pisos, pero mientras María permanezca, los 13 apartamentos turísticos del edificio quedarían ilegales.

Desde 2019, Digi ha expandido su cobertura hasta 13 millones de hogares, de los cuales 12 millones (el 93%) pueden recibir velocidades brutas de hasta 10 Gbps gracias a redes XGS-PON. El coste de despliegue medio por vivienda, calculado con la cobertura actual, asciende a 48 €, lo que subraya una eficiencia operativa significativa en el modelo de crecimiento de Digi. El ritmo de expansión continúa aumentando: en 2023 se sumaron 2,8 millones de hogares, en 2024 otros 3 millones y en lo que va de este año se han agregado otros 2 millones hasta septiembre. La meta es llegar a 20 millones en los próximos 3 a 4 años. En Andalucía, donde Digi firmó en 2023 un despliegue conjunto con el fondo Abrdn, ya se han conectados 2,5 millones de hogares.

González señaló que la amenaza de introducir a Ecuador en un conflicto bélico internacional, alineándose con los intereses de EE.UU., fue otro de los puntos clave de la campaña.

A diferencia de las sanciones de empleo y sueldo, una amonestación por escrito no implica dejar de trabajar ni deja rastro inmediato de castigo económico, pero sí se considera una sanción formal según el Estatuto de los Trabajadores. El autor advierte de que, aunque las empresas utilicen términos como 'advertencia' o 'conducta inapropiada' en lugar de 'falta' o 'sanción', el efecto legal sigue siendo el mismo: la empresa atribuye al trabajador una falta laboral. El riesgo de no impugnar estas amonestaciones es alto, ya que pueden acumularse y servir posteriormente como justificación para un despido disciplinario sin indemnización.

La isla está ubicada cerca de la frontera entre Canadá y Estados Unidos, siendo la propiedad privada más pequeña en el área. Aunque la familia la usa como residencia de verano, la isla se encuentra cerca de lugares mucho más turísticos y grandes, como la isla Heart Island, famosa por albergar el Castillo de Boldt, una construcción que comenzó como un regalo y terminó como una atracción turística. Esta pequeña isla se distingue no solo por su tamaño, sino también por su peculiar historia de vida aislada, muy cerca de las grandes multitudes que se encuentran al otro lado del río.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/just-room-enough-la-isla-mas-pequena-habitada-del-planeta</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/just-room-enough-la-isla-mas-pequena-habitada-del-planeta</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gigantes históricos: fotografías y perfiles de las personas más altas de la historia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La entrada recopila imágenes históricas y descripciones de personas excepcionalmente altas a lo largo de la historia, subrayando las condiciones médicas como gigantismo y acromegalia que las causan. Se mencionan casos de distintas épocas y lugares donde figuras muy por encima de la estatura promedio llamaron la atención de médicos, cronistas y el público, a veces convirtiéndose en leyendas vivientes. El artículo destaca que, aunque su altura despierta fascinación, también conlleva problemas de salud y desafíos diarios al vivir en un mundo hecho para cuerpos de tamaño normal. Entre las figuras listadas aparecen atletas, artistas y personas famosas por su estatura documentada, como Gogea Mitu (2,23 m), Zeng Jinlian (2,48 m), Robert Wadlow (2,72 m) y muchos otros cuyos registros provienen de fotografías, recortes de prensa o relatos históricos.

El fallo también otorga al padre el uso de la vivienda familiar, a pesar de que la madre y la hija todavía la ocupan. El caso se deriva de una revisión de la sentencia del divorcio dictada en 2024, donde se habían establecido medidas relacionadas con el uso de la vivienda y las pensiones alimenticias. En cuanto a la manutención, la decisión judicial concluye que la falta de relación con el padre no justifica la continuidad del pago, ya que no se ha demostrado un perjuicio físico o psíquico hacia el progenitor. Además, se desestimó la solicitud de la madre de incrementar la pensión alimenticia en 200 euros mensuales. En cuanto a la vivienda, la Audiencia argumentó que la madre no puede seguir usando la propiedad ya que puede acceder a una nueva vivienda, y el padre, dueño de la casa, podrá disfrutar de la misma.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-de-cuenca-retira-la-pension-alimenticia-a-una-hija-mayor-por-no-tener-relacion-con-su-padre</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-de-cuenca-retira-la-pension-alimenticia-a-una-hija-mayor-por-no-tener-relacion-con-su-padre</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un alto directivo del CNIO denuncia irregularidades millonarias en contratos públicos relacionados con la lucha contra el cáncer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un alto directivo del Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncológicas (CNIO) ha denunciado ante la Fiscalía Anticorrupción un presunto caso de malversación de entre 20 y 25 millones de euros en contratos públicos destinados a la investigación contra el cáncer durante los últimos 18 años. El denunciante, que desempeñó cargos relevantes entre 2022 y 2025, sostiene que varias empresas vinculadas a antiguos responsables del centro inflaron precios, fraccionaron pagos y facturaron por servicios inexistentes.

Mientras tanto, se reconoce la necesidad imperativa de adaptarse a los efectos del calentamiento global, como el aumento de temperaturas, sequías, incendios y huracanes. Florida, uno de los estados más vulnerables, ha invertido en programas para mejorar la resiliencia local, aunque sin usar abiertamente el término cambio climático. Personajes como Bill Gates han argumentado la importancia de enfocar recursos no solo en reducir emisiones sino en ayudar a comunidades a adaptarse a un clima cada vez más errático.

Este hallazgo, basado en los datos del cartografiado J-PAS obtenidos desde el Observatorio Astrofísico de Javalambre (Teruel), representa un importante avance para la astronomía española. RaJav pertenece a una categoría extremadamente rara de nebulosas de hidrógeno denominadas Lyman Alfa masivas (ELANe), de las que hasta ahora solo se conocían seis en todo el universo observable. Según los datos recogidos por la cámara JPCam instalada en el telescopio JST250, la nueva nebulosa podría ser incluso la más grande descubierta hasta la fecha, con un tamaño estimado cuatro veces superior al de la Vía Láctea.

Su tarea era determinar si estaban mentalmente capacitados para asumir la responsabilidad de sus crímenes. Kelley, formado en la Universidad de California y veterano del ejército norteamericano, convivió durante meses con figuras como Hermann Goering, jefe de la Luftwaffe y principal acusado. Aplicó diversas pruebas psicológicas, entre ellas el test de Rorschach, y concluyó que los acusados no padecían trastornos mentales: eran personas normales, con inteligencia promedio o superior. Esta constatación le resultó perturbadora, al descubrir que la maldad podía manifestarse en individuos psicológicamente sanos, movidos por ideologías, ambición o conformismo.

El retrato, de gran valor artístico, había estado en posesión de coleccionistas vieneses y se había presentado en la feria de arte Tefaf en Maastricht con un precio de 15 millones de euros. La pintura, que había estado en Hungría desde 1938, era parte de una colección que había pertenecido a una familia judía que huyó del nazismo. Las autoridades húngaras cuestionan la legalidad de su exportación, ya que el retrato debería haber sido revisado por una licencia de exportación antes de su salida del país. La situación se complica debido a la presencia de un sello de Klimt en la obra, que no fue detectado en el proceso. Ahora, las autoridades deben demostrar si el cuadro fue exportado de forma ilícita.

El alcalde de Château-Thierry lamentó profundamente esta decisión y subrayó el papel crucial que jugaba la fábrica en la identidad local. El cierre es consecuencia de procesos de reestructuración y de la decisión de Mondelēz, la propietaria actual, de trasladar parte de la producción a la República Checa por razones financieras, lo que llevó a despidos previos y, finalmente, a la clausura total.

Aunque parece un término con sentido propio, su nacimiento fue fruto del azar y del humor improvisado de un guionista, Stephen Engel, quien usó la palabra tras una broma inocente. La expresión fue adoptada por los guionistas para caracterizar a Sheldon, convirtiéndose rápidamente en un sello distintivo del personaje. Desde un punto de vista lingüístico, «bazinga» es una interjección inventada, una palabra sin raíz previa que expresa una emoción más que un concepto. Su estructura sonora —la combinación de “b”, “z” y el final “-inga”— le da ritmo, comicidad y universalidad, haciendo que su significado se comprenda incluso sin traducción.

Su modelo de producción en serie fue una de las bases que inspiró el crecimiento industrial de la región, sirviendo de ejemplo a numerosas fábricas que comenzaron a establecerse en la China continental durante la segunda mitad del siglo XX. El legado cultural del patito de goma trascendió su uso infantil, convirtiéndose en objeto de coleccionismo y arte pop, e inspirando proyectos como los patos inflables gigantes del artista neerlandés Florentijn Hofman.

Este tramo, entre Haradh y Al Batha, forma parte de una ruta de casi 1.480 kilómetros que conecta Ad Darb con la frontera de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos. Originalmente construida como vía privada para el rey Fahd, hoy es una arteria clave para el transporte de mercancías entre el centro y el oeste del país y los Emiratos. El paisaje infinito, sin montañas ni accidentes geográficos, facilita una conducción monótona que puede generar fatiga y somnolencia, aumentando el riesgo de desconexión al volante, especialmente ante posibles cruces de camellos. Para mitigar estos peligros, el Ministerio de Transporte y Logística saudí ha implementado mejoras de seguridad: arcenes asfaltados, marcas reflectantes, barreras, señalización y hitos kilométricos.

Según la autopsia preliminar, la mujer presentaba cerca de cincuenta heridas por arma blanca y falleció antes que su marido, quien posteriormente se habría suicidado. Los cuerpos fueron encontrados en habitaciones distintas de su vivienda por su hijo, que avisó al 112 al descubrir la escena. A su llegada, los servicios del Summa 112 solo pudieron confirmar el fallecimiento de ambas personas. El hombre, con antecedentes psiquiátricos, sufría depresión y fuertes dolores de espalda que trataba con medicación, a veces combinada con alcohol. Además, había protagonizado intentos autolíticos en el pasado, lo que, según los investigadores, encaja con el escenario observado. No existían denuncias previas por violencia de género ni la mujer figuraba en el sistema Viogén, lo que sitúa el caso entre los llamados 'silentes', sin señales de riesgo detectadas previamente.

El artículo contextualiza la intervención dentro de un patrón de comentarios políticos de King, conocido por su postura abiertamente izquierdista, que ha sido objeto de debates y reacciones variadas entre el público. Además, se señala que King ha utilizado el humor para señalar lo que percibe como políticas y decisiones del liderazgo estadounidense a las que se opone, como los aranceles y ciertas políticas económicas.

Esta decisión, confirmada por el ministro de Clima, permite coordinar ministerios, activar protocolos de emergencia y diseñar planes de contingencia ante un escenario que podría alterar el clima europeo y los equilibrios climáticos globales. El AMOC es una gran cinta transportadora oceánica que reparte aguas cálidas desde el Caribe hacia el Atlántico Norte, suavizando inviernos en Europa y contribuyendo al balance térmico. El calentamiento global acelera el deshielo en Groenlandia y el Ártico, aumentando el agua dulce en el Atlántico Norte y diluyendo la salinidad, lo que podría debilitar o detener la circulación profunda.

Los ejecutados fueron Fermín Elías Sanz Velasco, Antonino Albarrán Moreno, Pedro Antón Morata, Lucio Esteban Mansilla y Ángel Prieto Alonso, quienes fueron detenidos y asesinados sin juicio previo. Años después, en octubre de 2004, sus cuerpos fueron exhumados y recuperados por sus familiares y el Foro por la Memoria de Segovia. Este acto de represión forma parte de los crímenes perpetrados durante la Guerra Civil Española, cuando miles de republicanos y socialistas fueron perseguidos, asesinados y desaparecidos.

El sistema, conocido como HeatHub, fue desarrollado por la empresa Thermify y forma parte del proyecto SHIELD, impulsado por UK Power Networks para promover soluciones sostenibles en hogares con bajos ingresos. Este HeatHub alberga más de 500 ordenadores que, al procesar datos, generan calor. Ese calor se transfiere mediante aceite al sistema de agua caliente de la vivienda. Gracias a esta innovadora instalación, los Bridges han reducido su factura energética mensual de unas 375 libras a entre 40 y 60.

A lo largo de las últimas décadas, PayPal inauguró una confianza entre compradores y vendedores que no requería la tarjeta física, cambiando el eje del poder hacia las aplicaciones. Posteriormente, Skrill ofreció una alternativa ágil para nichos específicos como apuestas online y juegos, mientras Revolut introducía una forma de banca móvil multi-divisa y sin sucursales. En España, Bizum representó la respuesta nacional a este cambio de paradigma, enfatizando la inmediatez y la eliminación de datos bancarios directos en las transacciones cotidianas.

Entre las revelaciones, Epstein sostiene que Trump pasó horas en su casa con una de las víctimas, y que 'sabía sobre las chicas', lo que arroja más sombra sobre el carácter de su relación, en un momento de fuerte presión ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vuelve-la-polemica-estatua-que-representa-la-relacion-entre-trump-y-epstein-en-washington</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vuelve-la-polemica-estatua-que-representa-la-relacion-entre-trump-y-epstein-en-washington</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Milei elogia a Netanyahu y genera rechazo por sus declaraciones sobre Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente argentino, Javier Milei, ha causado controversia al afirmar que la humanidad debería estar agradecida con el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, y su gobierno, describiéndolo como el bastión de Occidente. Este comentario llega en un contexto de creciente violencia en Gaza, donde el ejército israelí ha causado la muerte de más de 69.000 personas. Las redes sociales han reaccionado con dureza, acusando a Milei de hacer una declaración 'genocida' y de apoyar a Netanyahu, un líder al que algunos consideran responsable de crímenes contra la humanidad. Las reacciones de repudio han sido generalizadas, incluso entre algunos de los propios seguidores de Milei, quienes se han mostrado sorprendidos y decepcionados por sus palabras. A pesar de las críticas, Milei ha mantenido su postura, reafirmando su amistad con Netanyahu, lo que ha intensificado la polémica en torno a sus declaraciones.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/milei-elogia-a-netanyahu-y-genera-rechazo-por-sus-declaraciones-sobre-gaza</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/milei-elogia-a-netanyahu-y-genera-rechazo-por-sus-declaraciones-sobre-gaza</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El alcalde de Córdoba critica la respuesta de la Aemet ante el temporal y la tardanza en activar la alerta naranja]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia informa sobre las declaraciones del alcalde de Córdoba, José María Bellido, respecto a la gestión de la alerta meteorológica durante un temporal que dejó más de 140 incidencias. Bellido afirma que no hubo información suficiente previa y que los servicios de emergencia se tuvieron que adaptar “sobre la marcha” ante un fenómeno que, según él, se activó con retraso en diversos canales de comunicación. Señala que la alerta amarilla por lluvia dio paso a una alerta naranja cuando ya el temporal había comenzado, y que la notificación a través de Twitter de Aemet Andalucía mostró disparidad temporal respecto a otras comunicaciones oficiales sobre el mismo evento. El alcalde menciona que no llegaron avisos a los correos electrónicos de los responsables de Bomberos y Policía Local, y que no se pudieron reforzar de forma preventiva, obligando a reorganizar operativos durante la tarde. El dispositivo final incluyó más personal de la Policía Local (63 agentes más 21) y 40 bomberos opera]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-alcalde-de-cordoba-critica-la-respuesta-de-la-aemet-ante-el-temporal-y-la-tardanza-en-activar-la-alerta-naranja</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-alcalde-de-cordoba-critica-la-respuesta-de-la-aemet-ante-el-temporal-y-la-tardanza-en-activar-la-alerta-naranja</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Francia impone prisión domiciliaria a un gato tras quejas vecinales por sus travesuras]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este artículo describe un caso singular ocurrido en Francia, donde una dueña ha visto restringido el movimiento de su gato, Rémi, a raíz de una orden judicial. Las quejas de un vecino denunciaron que el felino dejó huellas en pavimento fresco, orinó en un edredón y orinificó en jardines, provocando molestias y costos legales. La juez impuso una sanción inicial a la dueña, que asciende a 1.250 euros por daños y costos legales, con una multa adicional de 30 euros por cada nueva infracción si el gato intenta cruzar la cerca vecinal. Dada la situación repetida, se emitió una nueva orden que prohíbe sacar al animal de la casa. Este caso, que ha generado atención mediática, subraya los límites entre la convivencia vecinal, el bienestar animal y la responsabilidad de los dueños ante comportamientos problemáticos de sus mascotas. La propietaria sostiene que el gato ha mostrado cambios de comportamiento y se ha vuelto más agresivo y gordo, atribuyendo parte de la situación al confinamiento.

Casanova forma parte del comité de expertos que asesora al Gobierno de España en los actos de conmemoración del 50 aniversario de la muerte de Franco. El historiador explica que la memoria histórica está dividida, ya que durante la dictadura franquista la narrativa oficial excluyó a las voces de los vencidos, lo que dificulta un relato común. También destaca cómo la derecha y algunos sectores de la sociedad española continúan defendiendo aspectos de la dictadura y presentan una versión sesgada de los hechos. En cuanto a la figura del rey Juan Carlos I, Casanova sugiere que su historia debe ser revisada a la luz de los nuevos documentos y memorias que aparecerán.

Nutropy emplea fermentación de precisión para generar caseína en micelas a partir de microorganismos cultivados en biorreactores, alimentados con azúcares y nutrientes. Aunque no se ha revelado la cepa exacta, el enfoque busca obtener una proteína funcional capaz de fundirse y cuajar similar a la de la leche de vaca, sin recurrir a la ganadería tradicional ni a los subproductos como el suero. El proyecto apunta a un producto en polvo llamado «queseble», diseñado como ingrediente B2B para que fabricantes alimentarios integren la tecnología sin adaptar radicalmente sus líneas de producción. En la práctica, el objetivo es lograr paridad de precios con la leche y ampliar el portafolio hacia yogures y helados, manteniendo una huella ambiental reducida.

El objeto, identificado como tipo Biebrich y datado en la primera mitad del siglo I d.C., es particularmente relevante por ser el primero de su especie hallado en la Península Ibérica y por contener sedimentos originales de tinta, algo inusual en la arqueología. El análisis multidisciplinar publicado en la revista Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences revela que la tinta es una mezcla compleja de carbón amorfo, negro de hueso, compuestos ferrogálicos, cera de abejas y derivados de grasas animales. Esta composición indica la existencia de una 'tinta mixta', confirmando que los artesanos romanos experimentaban con diferentes ingredientes para mejorar la calidad de la escritura.

El texto hace hincapié en relaciones opacas de Zelensky con oligarcas como Kolomoisky y con intereses en Israel y Chipre. Además, recoge teorías y declaraciones de fuentes ucranianas y rusas sobre la presunta implicación ideológica o práctica de Zelensky en el intento de asesinato de Donald Trump y el homicidio del activista norteamericano Charlie Kirk, aunque tales afirmaciones carecen de pruebas verificadas y se presentan envueltas en un tono sensacionalista. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acusaciones-y-escandalos-sobre-zelensky-en-el-contexto-de-la-guerra-en-ucrania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acusaciones-y-escandalos-sobre-zelensky-en-el-contexto-de-la-guerra-en-ucrania</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 19:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Quiet Earth (1985): análisis y contexto de una ciencia ficción desoladora]]></title><description><![CDATA[La reseña presenta The Quiet Earth (1985), una película neozelandesa de ciencia ficción dirigida por Geoff Murphy y basada en la novela homónima de Craig Harrison. La historia sigue a Zac Hobson, un científico que, al despertar una mañana, descubre que la ciudad está desierta y que parece ser la única persona sobreviviente. A través de su experiencia, la película explora themes como la soledad, la culpa y la posibilidad de un mundo postapocalíptico donde lo físico y lo metafísico se entrelazan. Se compara con obras clásicas como The Purple Cloud y The World, the Flesh and the Devil, destacando la forma en que la película maneja la desaparición de la humanidad y la pregunta sobre qué significa estar vivo. El filme, de bajo presupuesto (aprox. 1 millón de dólares) se centra en las relaciones entre los pocos personajes y su evolución emocional, con un final que invita a reflexionar sobre la vida, la muerte y la posibilidad de un más allá.

Horas después, Doina, su pareja, encontró a Ion inconsciente; una segunda ambulancia sí lo llevó al hospital, donde continuaron tratándolo como si estuviera bajo los efectos del alcohol, recibiendo solo vitaminas.

A través de mecánicas centradas en la exploración, la resolución de puzles y la interpretación de señales no verbales, el jugador debe comprender las motivaciones de los protagonistas y desentrañar un misterio que se despliega de forma gradual. El diseño artístico, con una iluminación y paleta de colores sobrios, refuerza la sensación de introspección y desolación, mientras que la banda sonora juega un papel crucial para marcar el ritmo emocional de cada escena.

A pesar de las cifras oficiales que intentaban mostrar un crecimiento en el sector, las realidades de las clases trabajadoras y las tensiones sociales no se reflejaron adecuadamente en estos informes. Los datos muestran una clara disparidad entre las zonas urbanas y rurales, con la vivienda en las grandes ciudades siendo más accesible en comparación con las zonas rurales.

Joan Amorós, presidente de Ferrmed, explicó que las inversiones en infraestructuras de alta velocidad, como el tren de Tarragona, se han desviado hacia Madrid, en vez de beneficiar a las ciudades del corredor. Además, denunció que las obras actuales, principalmente centradas en el cambio de ancho de vía, no son suficientes para cubrir las necesidades futuras de transporte. A juicio de Amorós, se requieren 18.000 millones de euros de inversión para evitar el colapso de esta infraestructura, que amenaza con quedarse obsoleta rápidamente si no se hacen mejoras significativas.

Subasic, que trabajó en el Servicio de Inteligencia Militar, reveló que civiles italianos viajaban al frente para pagar por matar a civiles y combatientes durante el conflicto. Según su análisis de los interrogatorios a prisioneros serbios, los ‘cazadores’ pagaban a los serbios para disparar a personas en la ciudad, eligiendo incluso el tipo de víctima y el precio. El caso fue comunicado a la agencia de inteligencia italiana SISMI, que confirmó la información y aseguró que la actividad fue neutralizada. Karic, tras ver el documental ‘Sarajevo Safari’, presentó una denuncia penal ante la Fiscalía de Bosnia-Herzegovina y amplió la investigación con testimonios de testigos internacionales.

Estrela, quien recibió el premio al mejor largometraje documental por su obra 'Equipo Crónica.

Reb Beach, guitarrista de Whitesnake, ha corroborado la noticia asegurando que Coverdale ya no tiene fuerzas para seguir viajando ni afrontar nuevas giras. Coverdale vendió recientemente su catálogo musical por 50 millones de dólares, lo que apunta a una planificación de su jubilación. Su trayectoria abarca desde sus inicios en bandas locales hasta el éxito internacional con Deep Purple y Whitesnake, pasando po]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/david-coverdale-anuncia-su-retirada-definitiva-por-motivos-de-salud-tras-mas-de-50-anos-de-carrera</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/david-coverdale-anuncia-su-retirada-definitiva-por-motivos-de-salud-tras-mas-de-50-anos-de-carrera</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo se gestiona la cocina y el abastecimiento de alimentos en el crucero más grande del mundo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Symphony of the Seas, propiedad de Royal Caribbean, se considera una ciudad flotante con más de 6.000 pasajeros y 2.200 tripulantes, por lo que la logística de la alimentación a bordo es monumental. Cada día se preparan y sirven unas 30.000 comidas sin descanso. El equipo de cocina, formado por más de 1.000 trabajadores, incluye chefs, pasteleros, cortadores y encargados de stock, todos perfectamente coordinados en espacios reducidos y con una organización casi militar. La compra y almacenamiento de alimentos empieza mucho antes de zarpar, se basa en previsiones de consumo y considera factores como la nacionalidad de los pasajeros y el clima. El abastecimiento supone un presupuesto de un millón de dólares semanal y requiere un calendario preciso para cubrir los 23 restaurantes y buffets del navío. Los ingredientes se distribuyen en cámaras por temperatura y tipo; cada alimento tiene destino determinado. Los desayunos incluyen 7.000 huevos diarios, toneladas de fruta y cientos de pan]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-se-gestiona-la-cocina-y-el-abastecimiento-de-alimentos-en-el-crucero-mas-grande-del-mundo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-se-gestiona-la-cocina-y-el-abastecimiento-de-alimentos-en-el-crucero-mas-grande-del-mundo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Clínico elimina temporalmente las urgencias oncológicas y redirige a pacientes a Urgencias Generales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Hospital Clínico de València ha eliminado temporalmente el servicio especial de urgencias oncológicas, obligando a los pacientes con cáncer a acudir a Urgencias Generales. Esta medida, que entró en vigor el 22 de septiembre, ha generado malestar entre los afectados y sus familias, quienes denuncian largas esperas y el riesgo de contagio de enfermedades como gripe o covid, especialmente grave en personas con el sistema inmunológico debilitado. Los familiares critican que la espera puede prolongarse hasta cuatro horas solo para el triaje, y que compartir sala con pacientes de otras patologías aumenta el peligro de complicaciones. Además, el personal sanitario también ha mostrado su preocupación por la decisión, aunque no pueden hacer nada al respecto. La Conselleria de Sanidad asegura que el cambio es circunstancial y organizativo, derivado de los traslados y reorganización de los servicios, y que se espera recuperar el servicio de urgencias oncológicas a principios de 2026.

Según sus declaraciones, notó molestias en el estómago, pero pensó que se trataba de un malestar común. Fue solo cuando se sintió mal durante la noche que le pidió a su padre que la llevara al hospital, pero no tuvo tiempo de salir, ya que el bebé nació en casa. Olivia Mínguez, la madre, aseguró que no tenía ningún indicio de embarazo, aunque estaba en su noveno mes y algo hinchada, pero nunca pensó que podría estar esperando un hijo. Su pareja, Aitor Chaves, fue despertado por ella cuando empezaron los dolores, y aunque al principio no creyeron que fuera a dar a luz en ese momento, todo ocurrió rápidamente. El bebé nació sano y, tras la intervención de los servicios de emergencias, madre e hijo fueron trasladados al hospital.

En cuanto a las lluvias, se esperan precipitaciones escasas, salvo en el Cantábrico y Baleares. Para las dos semanas siguientes, entre el 24 y el 30 de noviembre, las temperaturas estarán dentro de los valores normales o ligeramente superiores, con pocas lluvias en la zona mediterránea.

A pesar de las expectativas y del contexto de una bonanza petrolera, el proyecto ha reducido su alcance a apenas 2,4 kilómetros y una capacidad de 300.000 habitantes. Informes de Financial Times y Reuters sugieren retrasos, recortes presupuestarios y desvío de recursos hacia inversiones más seguras, sin anuncios oficiales de recortes; las fechas de entrega se han diluido y el calendario cerrado ha pasado a ser incierto. El contexto económico actual, más prudente, ha llevado a recortes de ambición y ha expuesto críticas sobre el impacto social y ambiental: desplazamientos de comunidades, denuncias laborales y efectos adversos en rutas migratorias de aves.

El autor retrata las desventuras de un alma bohemia que lucha por escapar de la alienación laboral, enfrentándose a jefes incompetentes, compañeros trepas, proyectos absurdos y cenas de empresa con lavado de cerebro. La obra utiliza conceptos como Filostros y Forlayos y hace guiños a autores como Bukowski y Orwell, mezclando sátira con filosofía y lírica. La reseña destaca que el libro es más accesible para quienes comparten el mundo laboral del protagonista, ya que el uso de argot técnico puede dificultar la comprensión para otros lectores. Aunque el libro está bien escrito y no tiene errores gramaticales, la autora de la reseña considera que el ritmo decae con el avance de la lectura y que algunas historias se vuelven irreales o repetitivas.

Las personas entrevistadas provienen en su mayoría de América Latina o el norte de África y relatan condiciones laborales precarias, tratativas de contratación basadas en la disponibilidad diaria y una economía sumergida que dificulta su regularización.

A lo largo de casi cuatro décadas, la Iglesia no solo respaldó ideológicamente al régimen, sino que se convirtió en su mayor fuente de legitimación internacional y nacional, presentando a España como la defensa del catolicismo frente al peligro del comunismo. La imagen de Francisco Franco paseando bajo palio simboliza esta fusión entre poder político y religioso, que permitió reforzar un estado moral y cultural conforme a las directrices de la Iglesia. El texto detalla cómo, desde la Guerra Civil, la Iglesia apoyó al bando sublevado y cómo, tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, intervino para evitar la condena internacional del régimen, obteniendo a cambio privilegios y exenciones fiscales con instrumentos como el Concordato de 1953.

El 70% de las personas con diabetes en España reportan sentirse juzgadas, mientras que una gran proporción ha visto información inexacta en los medios y percibe que la diabetes es objeto de burla. Estas percepciones generan vergüenza, miedo y, en algunos casos, evitan que las personas compartan su diagnóstico con familiares o amigos. Las consecuencias para la salud incluyen cancelaciones de citas médicas por sentirse juzgados y respuestas fisiológicas elevadas ante comentarios estigmatizantes. El artículo destaca que los mitos sobre el azúcar como única causa, el peso y la idea de que la dieta y el ejercicio pueden curar la condición persisten en la sociedad.

Se compara la vivienda, el alquiler, la compra de un coche de gama baja y los gastos de suministros frente al salario mínimo de cada periodo (1960s, 1990s, 2010 y 2024). Según la información citada, el salario mínimo actual para la Generación Z no basta para cubrir los gastos básicos cuando se toma como referencia una persona soltera que depende de un único sueldo. Así, mientras que para los Boomers y la Generación X el gasto representaba un porcentaje menor del ingreso, la Generación Z se ve obligada a destinar el 146% de su salario mínimo solo para afrontar alquiler, vivienda, transporte y suministros. Además, se señalan incrementos en la entrada de ocio (cine, conciertos) y en productos como videojuegos, museos y servicios como luz e internet, que han contribuido a agravar la brecha entre ingresos y coste de vida.

En la obra, la autora advierte que la democracia se desintegra cuando desaparecen los hechos compartidos que sustentan el debate público. Para Martínez-Bascuñán, los populismos han aprovechado la crisis de los llamados 'intermediarios invisibles' —periodismo, ciencia, instituciones— para imponer realidades alternativas donde la lealtad a la tribu o al líder pesa más que la evidencia. La politóloga sostiene que la mentira en política no es nueva, pero que ahora se ejerce desde el poder con una intención distinta: no convencer de una falsedad concreta, sino destruir la confianza colectiva en cualquier verdad. Frente a ello, defiende que la verdad debe emerger desde la ciudadanía y mantenerse a través]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mariam-martinez-bascunan-la-mentira-politica-y-el-derrumbe-del-mundo-comun</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mariam-martinez-bascunan-la-mentira-politica-y-el-derrumbe-del-mundo-comun</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 22:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La montaña de cráneos de bisonte: una historia de explotación colonial y devastación de las llanuras]]></title><description><![CDATA[La pieza de BBC Future explora una imagen icónica del siglo XIX que, a simple vista, muestra una pila escalofriante de cráneos de bisonte. Sin embargo, el artículo desvela un contexto mucho más profundo: la matanza masiva de bisontes no fue solo resultado de la caza descontrolada, sino una campaña planificada que buscaba debilitar a las naciones nativas americanas y facilitar la expansión colonial. La desaparición de la especie devastó comunidades enteras que dependían del bisonte para alimentación, abrigo y herramientas, y sirvió como táctica militar y económica para reclamar tierras y recursos. Expertas como Tasha Hubbard y Bethany Hughes señalan que detrás de la violencia contra los bisontes se halla una lógica colonial y capitalista que, al convertir a los animales y, por extensión, a los pueblos indígenas en simples recursos, deshumaniza y facilita la dominación. A pesar de que hoy los bisontes resisten como parte de esfuerzos de conservación, la historia recuerda que el progreso ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-montana-de-craneos-de-bisonte-una-historia-de-explotacion-colonial-y-devastacion-de-las-llanuras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-montana-de-craneos-de-bisonte-una-historia-de-explotacion-colonial-y-devastacion-de-las-llanuras</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 21:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Testimonios de ex presos políticos del franquismo y la importancia de preservar la memoria histórica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El reportaje narra las vivencias de varios ex presos políticos del franquismo, como Marcel Camacho, hijo del histórico sindicalista Marcelino Camacho, que destaca la dura represión sufrida por quienes lucharon por derechos que hoy son constitucionales.

El drama se agravaba en las prisiones de mujeres, gestionadas por organizaciones religiosas afines al régimen, donde se encarcelaba a mujeres por motivos como la infidelidad o el abandono de hogar.

Desde 2024, la plantilla trabaja 38,5 horas semanales, y en 2025 se redujo aún más a 37,5 horas. Esta medida ha demostrado ser efectiva no solo en términos de productividad, sino también en la satisfacción del personal. Especialmente beneficioso ha sido para las camareras de piso, quienes vieron disminuida su carga de trabajo a 32 horas semanales a partir de los 58 años. Según Fitaroni, esta iniciativa ha resultado en una disminución drástica del absentismo, que pasó de un 27,5 % a menos del 5 % en el sector. La idea de MarSenses fue acogida positivamente por los sindicatos, como Kellys Union Balear, y podría servir de ejemplo para otros hoteles en la región, pues demuestra que la conciliación laboral no tiene que comprometer la rentabilidad de la empresa.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reduccion-de-jornada-laboral-en-marsenses-mejora-la-productividad-y-reduce-el-absentismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reduccion-de-jornada-laboral-en-marsenses-mejora-la-productividad-y-reduce-el-absentismo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 15 Nov 2025 21:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis geopolítico: los cuatro escenarios bélicos posibles bajo la administración de Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este análisis geopolítico examina, a partir de la figura de Donald Trump, cuatro escenarios bélicos que podrían definir la relación de Estados Unidos con el mundo.

El primer cuadrante, Europa, se presenta como una región ya desestabilizada y cada vez más subordinada a Washington, con una posible retirada gradual del conflicto que afectaría a la OTAN. El segundo, Asia centro-occidental, aborda la tensión entre apoyar a Israel y mantener lazos estratégicos con potencias árabes productoras de petróleo, lo que genera tensiones internas y una credibilidad estratégica cuestionable.

Según sus creadores, este chip sería hasta 1.000 veces más rápido que las GPUs de Nvidia en tareas de inteligencia artificial, y ya se está utilizando en sectores como la aeroespacial y las finanzas. El diseño monolítico permite integrar más de 1.000 componentes ópticos en una oblea de silicio de 6 pulgadas, lo que facilita su compactación y escalabilidad. Además, los sistemas con estos chips pueden desplegarse en solo dos semanas, frente a los seis meses habituales en computadoras cuánticas tradicionales. La tecnología utiliza luz en lugar de materia para transportar la información, lo que reduce el calor y mejora la eficiencia energética.

Las vías propuestas incluyen un incremento de la hormona luteinizante, mejoras en el sistema antioxidante testicular y una reducción del daño oxidativo asociado con metales pesados y toxinas, lo que podría favorecer la producción de testosterona. Además, se resalta que la cebolla contiene compuestos bioactivos como quercetina y sulfuros, que contribuyen a su efecto antioxidante y a la modulación de vías metabólicas como la AMPK y la producción de óxido nítrico.

Este fenómeno no implica que toda la juventud se haya alineado con la extrema derecha, sino que algunos se sienten identificados con su discurso de rebeldía frente al sistema, especialmente aquellos que enfrentan dificultades económicas y sociales. Expertos apuntan a que las redes sociales juegan un papel crucial en esta radicalización, al permitir que el discurso de la extrema derecha se difunda a través de memes, humor y mensajes fácilmente digeribles.

El texto señala que las tarifas y barreras comerciales, presentadas por el gobierno como un paso temporal hacia una prosperidad futura, también funcionan como un “impuesto anti-woke” que impacta de forma transversal al consumidor medio.

Una lectura forense (Galaxia Gutenberg, 2025), presenta a Júlia Nueno, ingeniera vinculada al equipo liderado por Eyal Weizman, que ha construido una cronología de las tácticas empleadas por Israel durante la fase de genocidio en Gaza iniciada en 2023. El reportaje detalla cómo, según la investigación, la destrucción de panaderías en norte y centro de Gaza entre octubre y noviembre de 2023 funcionó como una estrategia de desplazamiento; la interrupción de la cadena de suministro de alimentos y la posterior ocupación de refugios escolares muestran un patrón repetido en diversas infraestructuras clave. Además, se analiza la labor de documentación de hospitales mediante photomatching para precisar ubicaciones y tiempos, y se exploran los “corredores” humanitarios como herramientas de control territorial.

A partir de un ensayo de 2009, The Education of a Libertarian, se sostiene que Thiel cuestiona la compatibilidad entre libertad y democracia, defendiendo un progreso que exige decisiones impopulares y liderazgo fuerte. El texto describe cómo Thiel promueve ideas radicales como las seasteads, así como inversiones en biotecnología, inteligencia artificial y criogenia, desde una perspectiva tecnocrática que imagina un futuro gobernado por ingenieros y capital privado. Se destaca su cercanía a movimientos neorreaccionarios y su apoyo público a figuras políticas conservadoras, lo que alimenta preocupaciones sobre una posible erosión de derechos y del marco democrático. El artículo también examina su papel en Palantir y su historial de contratos con el Estado, subrayando la tensión entre vigilancia masiva y libertades civiles.

La pregunta, comparando la situación con la de Rusia y Ucrania, se viralizó en redes y canales percibidos como contrarios a la línea oficial, lo que, según la agencia, provocó su destitución por 'incomodidad' y alegando falta de conocimientos técnicos en derecho internacional. Nunziati afirma que la decisión ha creado un clima de temor entre periodistas y es un reflejo de la presión creciente y los ataques recientes que sufre la prensa en Italia, incluyendo amenazas y atentados.

Su caso pone en el punto de mira las políticas migratorias impuestas por la administración Trump, que permiten detener y deportar a solicitantes de asilo aunque tengan sus expedientes en regla. Tras huir de Rusia por su oposición a la guerra en Ucrania y el riesgo real de persecución, emigraron con su hijo y buscaron protección en Estados Unidos, donde trataron de integrarse de forma legal y activa. El aumento de redadas y deportaciones en California, dirigido oficialmente a “delincuentes peligrosos”, ha acabado afectando a personas sin antecedentes, creando una atmósfera de miedo en la comunidad migrante rusa.

Además, el agresor lo fuerza a fumar y llega a intentar quemarlo con un cigarro. Los hechos ocurrieron en presencia de otros menores, que al parecer, instaron al agresor a cesar el maltrato, pero no intervinieron. La familia de la víctima está dispuesta a presentar una denuncia formal, lo que dará paso a la investigación policial.

Según su testimonio, el Centro de Coordinación Operativa Integrada (Cecopi) empezó a debatir el envío del mensaje alrededor de las cinco de la tarde, pero este no fue remitido hasta las 20:11, pese a la insistencia de Pradas en que se comunicara cuanto antes. El asesor afirmó que la exconsellera presionó repetidamente para emitir el aviso, mientras los técnicos dudaban sobre la redacción y contenido del mensaje, proponiendo versiones distintas.

Este bloqueo forma parte de una estrategia más amplia del grupo para aislar las principales ciudades del país y debilitar a la junta militar liderada por Assimi Goïta, que llegó al poder en 2020 tras un golpe de Estado. En los últimos años, el JNIM ha ampliado su control territorial sobre amplias zonas del país, aprovechando la falta de presencia estatal y la debilidad del ejército. Ahora, mediante ataques a convoyes y sabotajes en rutas clave hacia Costa de Marfil y Senegal, el grupo ha logrado paralizar parcialmente el suministro de combustible y bienes esenciales, provocando escasez y apagones en la capital.

Aunque el ministro de Agricultura, Luis Planas, ha señalado que el impacto de la gripe aviar es puntual, otros factores como el cambio en los hábitos alimenticios de los españoles y la creciente demanda de proteínas de alta calidad están detrás de esta escalada.

En un contexto de creciente presión por el cierre, con empleados federales sin sueldo y programas sociales vitales como SNAP en riesgo, los demócratas se enfrentaban a un dilema. Mientras Trump mantenía una postura intransigente, los republicanos estaban profundamente divididos. La idea de abolir el filibuster en el Senado fue vista por algunos como un riesgo a largo plazo, mientras que otros preferían ceder para evitar peores consecuencias políticas.

Este estudio, publicado en la revista Stem Cell Reports, marca un avance importante en la búsqueda de nuevas terapias regenerativas frente a la diabetes tipo 1. En lugar de recurrir a trasplantes o implantar células externas, los científicos han demostrado que es posible transformar células del propio organismo en productoras de insulina. Para ello, modificaron genéticamente células gástricas de ratones activando un 'interruptor' que las convirtió en células similares a las beta pancreáticas. Cuando estas células se trasplantaron al abdomen de ratones diabéticos, lograron sobrevivir, integrarse en el tejido y secretar insulina, mejorando los niveles de glucosa y el metabolismo de los animales.

La Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT) subraya que la medida es definitiva, no habrá prórrogas ni excepciones, y todo el país está avisado desde hace años. El cambio, aprobado inicialmente en 2021 pero con detalles clave anunciados en 2023, obliga a que la baliza sea capaz de conectarse con la plataforma digital DGT 3.0.

Burry, tras notificar a los reguladores y comunicar a sus inversores que devolverá el capital antes de fin de año salvo una pequeña retención para auditoría e impuestos, sostiene que los precios actuales de las acciones se han desvinculado de los fundamentos económicos. Su carta a los inversores, fechada el 27 de octubre, refleja que sus estimaciones de valor no coinciden desde hace tiempo con el sentimiento del mercado. El contexto es de tensión entre inversores, ante la posibilidad de una burbuja, tras años de fuertes rentabilidades y valores tecnológicos disparados por la fiebre de la inteligencia artificial.

Fitzgerald sostiene que la figura central del cristianismo podría ser una mitología historicizada, un conjunto de tropes religiosos antiguos que adquirieron detalles históricos a lo largo de la transmisión. Frente a ello, Bart Ehrman y otros historiadores secularistas sostienen que hubo un líder radical cuyo núcleo quedó cubierto por mitos y desarrollo literario. En su trilogía Jesus: Mything in Action, Fitzgerald analiza pruebas y fuentes que, según él, muestran que muchos textos del Nuevo Testamento son creaciones divertidas por intereses doctrinales y periodísticos de las primeras comunidades cristianas, más que biografías estrictas de un Jesús histórico. La conversación aborda por qué persiste la resistencia entre no creyentes ante la idea de un Jesús compuesto o mítico, y cómo podría haber surgido el cristianismo si no existiera un fundador singular.

El Comité Intercentros de la Corporación de Servizos Audiovisuais de Galicia (CSAG) sostiene que la línea editorial impuesta por el actual gobierno de la Xunta ha causado un grave deterioro de la credibilidad y una pérdida masiva de audiencia. En octubre, la TVG registró una cuota media del 7,7%, una de las más bajas en sus cuarenta años de historia. 

El nombramiento de Concepción Pombo como directora general —decisión cuestionada por considerarse un 'dedazo' político— ha intensificado las críticas internas.

En ciertos casos, el software parece apagarse, pero el hardware permanece encendido, lo que indica un fallo profundo a nivel del sistema.

Durante años, Tesla y las marcas europeas dominaron el sector, pero la llegada de los fabricantes chinos ha alterado el equilibrio. BYD destaca como el principal impulsor de este avance, pasando de 3.801 matriculaciones en 2024 a más de 11.700 en el presente año. Gracias a su amplia gama de modelos eléctricos y su competitiva relación calidad-precio, China ya alcanza el 22,8% de la cuota de mercado nacional, situándose como un actor clave en el panorama automovilístico español. A su alrededor, marcas como MG, Leapmotor, Volvo y Polestar refuerzan la presencia china ofreciendo productos variados y adaptados a distintos segmentos, desde los compactos hasta el mercado premium.

A pesar de este ascenso, Europa mantiene el liderazgo con un 41,9% de participación, apoyada en su sólida base industrial y su red de concesionarios.

La prensa internacional ha destacado la entrega de 'paquetes de dólares e inodoros de oro', refiriéndose a un fraude que afecta a altos funcionarios ucranianos, incluida la familia del presidente. El caso ha llevado a la dimisión de varios ministros, entre ellos el ministro de Justicia, German Galushchenko, y la ministra de Energía, mientras que Oleksii Chernichov, ex viceprimer ministro y pariente cercano de Zelenski, está en el centro de la investigación. Las investigaciones han revelado que el dinero desviado no solo afectó al sector energético, sino también al militar.

Encarnita Polo fue una de las figuras más destacadas de la música pop y la copla en España durante los años 60 y 70. A pesar de haberse alejado de la música y la televisión, su legado perdura gracias a su característico estilo flamenco-pop y su interpretación única.

Sin embargo, el único grupo demográfico que se mostró en contra de Mamdani fueron los hombres blancos, quienes favorecieron al exgobernador Andrew Cuomo por un margen de 49% frente al 42% de Mamdani. A pesar de sus controvertidas propuestas, como la desfinanciación de la policía, Mamdani consiguió un apoyo mayoritario entre los votantes más jóvenes, especialmente aquellos que no veían el crimen como un problema importante.

Desde entonces, la moneda pasó por múltiples rediseños, como el Chain Cent de 1793, el Indian Head Cent de 1859 o el célebre Lincoln Wheat Penny, acuñado desde 1909 en homenaje al presidente Abraham Lincoln.

Se resalta la creciente concentración de riqueza en una oligarquía occidental, la pérdida de África como fuente de ingresos y suministros, y la degradación de la cadena de mando militar debido a la creciente autonomía de los jefes bárbaros y las luchas entre élites.

En sus inicios, designaba a los personajes no controlados por los jugadores, guiados por el código de los videojuegos. Sin embargo, en la última década, la palabra ha sufrido una resignificación cultural impulsada por foros como Reddit y comunidades de memes. Hoy, llamar a alguien 'un NPC' es sugerir que actúa sin pensamiento propio, repitiendo frases o comportamientos automatizados, como si funcionara en 'modo automático'. Entre los jóvenes, la expresión combina crítica y humor, y refleja una preocupación más profunda: el miedo a perder la individualidad en un mundo cada vez más dominado por algoritmos y patrones predecibles. La adaptación española mantiene ese tono irónico, usándose de forma lúdica entre amigos, pero también como una observación sobre la autenticidad en una sociedad hiperconecta]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-termino-npc-y-su-transformacion-en-el-lenguaje-juvenil-contemporaneo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-termino-npc-y-su-transformacion-en-el-lenguaje-juvenil-contemporaneo</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 22:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suecia condena a una mujer a 12 años por esclavizar a yazidíes durante el dominio del Estado Islámico]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un tribunal sueco ha condenado a Lina Ishaq, una ciudadana de 52 años, a 12 años de prisión por cometer genocidio y crímenes de guerra contra el pueblo yazidí mientras formaba parte del grupo terrorista Estado Islámico (EI) en Siria. Los hechos ocurrieron entre 2014 y 2016, cuando Ishaq mantuvo en condiciones de esclavitud a tres mujeres yazidíes y seis niños en la ciudad de Raqqa, entonces controlada por el EI. La sentencia supone un precedente importante, ya que es la primera vez que en Suecia se juzgan y condenan los crímenes del Estado Islámico contra la comunidad yazidí, una minoría étnico-religiosa originaria del norte de Irak que fue víctima de una persecución sistemática por parte de los yihadistas. El tribunal consideró probado que Ishaq colaboró activamente con la organización yihadista, aprovechándose de su poder sobre las víctimas y contribuyendo a su sometimiento forzoso.

Este informe abre la posibilidad de que figuras como Carles Puigdemont u Oriol Junqueras puedan presentarse nuevamente a elecciones, un aspecto que irrita a la derecha. El medio 'El Español' publicó una pieza en la que vincula al abogado con decisiones judiciales anteriores del Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos (TEDH), insinuando una afinidad ideológica favorable a la excarcelación de miembros de ETA. 

Este enfoque ha sido duramente criticado por distintos usuarios en la red social X (antiguo Twitter), entre ellos el ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, quien ironizó sobre la tendencia de ciertos medios a etiquetar como simpatizante de ETA a cualquiera que no comparta su discurso.

Expertos citados en el artículo señalan que el problema no es solo la especie, sino el modelo de ordenación de tierras: la fragmentación normativa entre leyes forestales, de suelo y ambiental genera inseguridad jurídica y dificulta una planificación real. Además, la prórroga de la moratoria, con excepciones hasta 2030, facilita la plantación de eucalipto en áreas afectadas por la enfermedad de la banda marrón y la transferencia de derechos de plantación, lo que, según los entrevistados, equivale a crear un banco de derechos de la especie. Se destacan las consecuencias ecológicas: reducción de biodiversidad, pérdida de pastos y de usos agropecuarios, degradación de suelos y mayor vulnerabilidad a incendios.

Según la tradición, Santiago habría sido uno de los doce apóstoles de Jesús y el primero en morir mártir, decapitado en el año 44 d. C. por orden de Herodes Agripa I. Aunque no existen fuentes antiguas que confirmen su presencia en Hispania, a partir del siglo VI comenzaron a circular relatos que lo situaban predicando el cristianismo en regiones como Galicia, Asturias y Zaragoza, donde se dice que fundó una capilla en el lugar que hoy ocupa la Basílica del Pilar. La leyenda sostiene que, tras su muerte en Palestina, dos de sus discípulos trasladaron su cuerpo hasta Galicia en una barca de piedra, el llamado Arca Marmórica, y lo enterraron en el bosque de Libredón, con la ayuda de la mítica Reina Lupa, tras múltiples milagros. Ocho siglos después, hacia el año 823, un ermitaño llamado Pelayo habría visto unas luces celestes en ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-legendario-de-la-tumba-del-apostol-santiago-en-compostela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-legendario-de-la-tumba-del-apostol-santiago-en-compostela</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2025 21:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El IX Congreso de FEDE pide igualdad territorial y mejora en el acceso a tratamientos para personas con diabetes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El IX Congreso Nacional de la Federación Española de Diabetes (FEDE), celebrado en Barcelona bajo el lema 'Formación, bienestar y calidad de vida', ha reunido a más de 300 asistentes entre pacientes, familiares, profesionales sanitarios y representantes institucionales.

Este hito refleja un cambio profundo en el mapa global de la innovación, antes dominado por Estados Unidos, Europa y Japón. China presentó 1,8 millones de solicitudes, un 9 % más que el año anterior y tres veces más que Estados Unidos, que quedó en segundo lugar con algo más de 600.000. En conjunto, Asia concentró el 70 % de las solicitudes, destacando también India y Corea del Sur. Europa y América del Norte, en cambio, perdieron peso relativo. Además, China no solo registra patentes, sino que también las concede a gran velocidad: en 2024 otorgó más de un millón, triplicando a Estados Unidos. Actualmente, China acumula 5,7 millones de patentes activas, seguida de EE. UU. con 3,5 millones.

La decisión supone un paso relevante en la investigación abierta contra el político, que fue denunciado por la intérprete por unos hechos que, según la denuncia, podrían constituir un delito de agresión sexual.

En una entrevista con el grupo editorial Axel Springer, Klichkó señaló que actualmente solo los jóvenes a partir de los 25 años son susceptibles de ser llamados a filas, pero sugirió que se podría bajar la edad a 22 o 23 años. A pesar de este planteamiento, Klichkó destacó que en tiempos pasados los jóvenes de 18 años servían en el Ejército, aunque los calificó de “niños”. Estas declaraciones surgen en un contexto de deserción y fuga masiva de ciudadanos ucranianos hacia el extranjero, lo que ha complicado la situación militar en el país. Además, se menciona que los propios hijos del alcalde viven y estudian fuera de Ucrania, lo que ha generado cierto contraste con sus propuestas.

A partir de la conocida entrevista de 60 Minutes y de varios acontecimientos judiciales, se señalan indicios de una estrategia de persecución contra figuras como James Comey, Letitia James y John Bolton, junto con otros posibles objetivos. La autora argumenta que estas acciones han contribuido a una percepción de purga interna en el Departamento de Justicia, con cambios en fiscales y agentes, y plantea preguntas sobre la independencia institucional y la política que rodea los procesos legales. Además, resalta la narrativa de que estas investigaciones forman parte de una campaña de retribución política más amplia, alimentada por declaraciones públicas del propio Trump y por el tratamiento de medios y figuras dentro del ámbito legal.

El autor del artículo relata su experiencia personal con la obra, destacando la importancia del prólogo de Rafel Llopis, que aborda temas como el racismo de Lovecraft y anécdotas sobre su vida personal. Además de los relatos de Lovecraft, el libro incluye textos de otros autores como Lord Dunsany y Arthur Machen, contribuyendo al entendimiento de los orígenes de los mitos. El artículo refleja también la importancia del libro como una puerta de entrada a la obra de Lovecraft, especialmente para quienes comenzaron a leer al autor a través del juego de rol 'La llamada de Cthulhu'.

Las imágenes, la última fechada el 8 de noviembre, muestran áreas enteras—principalmente barrios controlados por las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI)—arrasadas en menos de un mes mediante demoliciones, algunas de las cuales podrían no haber mostrado daños previos significativos. Aunque el proceso se ha justificado por las autoridades israelíes como parte de la desmilitarización y eliminación de infraestructura del “terror”, expertos y analistas consultados por la BBC señalan que estas demoliciones podrían violar puntos del cese al fuego respaldado por Estados Unidos, Egipto, Qatar y Turquía.

Se destaca el papel de Juan Carlos I y las reformas que llevaron a la proclamación de una monarquía parlamentaria, la consolidación de un estado de bienestar y la adhesión a la OTAN en 1982 y a la Unión Europea en 1986. A lo largo de las últimas décadas, España experimentó un notable crecimiento económico y un aumento de la productividad gracias a la liberalización iniciada en los 50 y a inversiones en turismo, inmigración y fondos comunitarios. Sin embargo, el artículo también señala tensiones contemporáneas, como la crisis financiera de 2008, la subida de movimientos nacionalistas y la fragmentación política, con el auge de formaciones como Podemos y Vox, y la gestión de la descentralización.

Este fenómeno se ha incrementado notablemente desde 2020, cuando el Gobierno andaluz de Juan Manuel Moreno eliminó el complemento de exclusividad, permitiendo que los facultativos públicos pudieran compatibilizar sus puestos con la actividad privada. Desde entonces, 3.544 médicos del SAS han obtenido autorización para trabajar también en el sector privado. El Ejecutivo andaluz defiende esta situación como parte de un modelo sanitario en el que la red privada complementa a la pública, pero la oposición denuncia que se trata de un proceso de privatización encubierta del sistema sanitario andaluz.

Los correos electrónicos filtrados y reportados por Drop Site News añaden peso a la hipótesis de que Epstein no solo facilitaba la explotación sexual y el acceso a elites políticas, sino que también era un intermediario clave en actividades de espionaje y ciberseguridad a favor de intereses israelíes. Koren, antiguo asistente del ex primer ministro y ministro de Defensa Ehud Barak —quien coordinó transferencias bancarias y entregas de paquetes a través de Epstein—, seguía vinculado a redes militares y de inteligencia mucho después de su retiro formal, sirviendo de enlace para reuniones con altos cargos estadounidenses y gestionando proyectos tecnológicos.

Consideró que el país atraviesa un periodo complicado, con un Gobierno debilitado, falta de presupuestos y enfrentamientos constantes con la justicia. Para él, la polarización y la pérdida de educación política son síntomas de un contexto dominado por el populismo.

Rajoy insistió en la necesidad de recuperar la moderación y el entendimiento entre fuerzas políticas sensatas, afirmando que España vive uno de los momentos más sombríos desde la aprobación de la Constitución de 1978.

Este fenómeno no se limita a España: en Francia y otros países vecinos también se observa una tendencia similar. Cada vez hay más turistas que optan por comprar comida en supermercados o hacer picnics, en lugar de sentarse en terrazas o restaurantes tradicionales. En lugares como Saint-Jean-de-Luz, varios hosteleros reconocen haber tenido que modificar sus cartas, pasando de ofrecer platos sofisticados a opciones más simples y económicas.

El texto critica la reacción interna en Mozilla, que el autor interpreta como un ejemplo de cancelación ideológica impulsada por una parte de la comunidad progresista. Según su análisis, la fundación Mozilla se habría alejado de su misión inicial, adoptando una deriva “woke” y directivos con remuneraciones desproporcionadas a pesar de la caída en usuarios y en ingresos.

Mokyr ha sido reconocido por identificar los requisitos previos para el crecimiento sostenido a través del progreso tecnológico, mientras que Aghion y Howitt han sido galardonados por desarrollar la teoría de la destrucción creativa, un concepto originalmente propuesto por Schumpeter. Esta teoría sostiene que el crecimiento económico surge cuando las innovaciones reemplazan tecnologías antiguas y empresas obsoletas, dinamizando la economía y permitiendo que nuevas empresas prosperen. La competencia, lejos de ser un obstáculo, es fundamental para impulsar la innovación, ya que obliga a las empresas a mejorar y a nuevos actores a entrar en el mercado.

Los investigadores reconstruyeron su perfil genético a partir de una muestra de tela manchada de sangre hallada en el sofá donde se suicidó en 1945.

Según Orriols, este sistema es insostenible porque depende de las cotizaciones de los trabajadores activos para financiar las pensiones actuales. En su intervención, también criticó la política migratoria, considerándola un 'error de cálculo', y afirmó que la inmigración no solo no contribuiría al sistema de pensiones, sino que sería un lastre para los servicios públicos como la sanidad, la educación y la vivienda. Además, denunció que la llegada masiva de inmigrantes pone en peligro la cohesión social y cultural de Cataluña, y advirtió que la sobrecarga de servicios podría conducir a su colapso. Orriols también culpó a los partidos tradicionales de crear lo que considera una 'cultura del subsidio' que, según ella, ha destruido el país.

Según el documento, en España solo hay cuatro ensayos clínicos activos de diabetes tipo 1, lo que sitúa al país en el décimo lugar europeo, por detrás de naciones como Alemania, Francia y Dinamarca. Este panorama contrasta con la relevancia de España en otras áreas biomédicas, donde en 2024 fue uno de los países con mayor actividad en nuevos estudios clínicos. La doctora Carmen Hurtado enfatiza que la integración de la investigación en la práctica clínica y la normalización de la participación en ensayos como parte de la atención podría acelerar el acceso a terapias innovadoras.

Sin embargo, los resultados de las elecciones en Nueva Jersey y Virginia han mostrado un fuerte retroceso en el apoyo a los candidatos republicanos entre estos grupos. A pesar de los esfuerzos por construir una coalición multirracial de clase trabajadora, expertos como Michael Podhorzer señalan que esta estrategia de Trump estaba sobreestimada. El análisis sugiere que la falta de apoyo en 2025 se debe en gran parte a una reacción negativa hacia el actual presidente.

Según los nuevos límites, ningún producto podrá superar el 0,3 % de THC total ni contener más de 0,4 miligramos de THC por envase. Esto afectará directamente a gominolas, aceites, tinturas, bebidas o productos de vapeo con cualquier dosis superior. Además, se prohíben los cannabinoides sintéticos o procesados fuera de la planta, lo que implica el fin del mercado de productos de cáñamo psicoactivos tal y como se conoce.

Hasta hace poco, la policía vasca describía a los arrestados solo por su edad y sexo, pero ahora incluye referencias como “de origen magrebí”, “latinoamericano” o “europeo”. El Ejecutivo vasco, encabezado por el PNV, asegura que la medida busca frenar la manipulación informativa de la extrema derecha y aumentar la transparencia, evitando que partidos como el PP o Vox utilicen de forma interesada los datos sobre nacionalidad. Sin embargo, colectivos como SOS Racismo Gipuzkoa califican la decisión de contraproducente, ya que —según estudios— asociar delitos a orígenes geográficos o étnicos contribuye a reforzar los prejuicios y la discriminación. También denuncian que el cambio no fue debatido en el Parlamento ni consensuado políticamente.

Esta acción llega después de que el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid (TSJM) archivara una primera querella motivada por la jubilación de la magistrada, alegando falta de competencia para conocer el asunto. El auto de archivo especifica que la jueza perdió su condición de aforada por su jubilación forzosa, publicada en el BOE, y que la querella podría dirigirse al órgano correspondiente. La nueva querella se apoya en documentos como la grabación de la declaración de la subinspectora de trabajo que elaboró el informe clave para el archivo del caso.

Diversos estudios y reportes señalan que los gatos pueden afectar poblaciones de aves y pequeños mamíferos, especialmente en zonas rurales y periurbanas, donde interactúan con ecosistemas frágiles y especies con bajas tasas de reproducción. Este artículo de National Geographic explora la magnitud del problema, las áreas más afectadas y las posibles medidas de gestión. Se analizan escenarios como la caza de presas por parte de los gatos, la superposición de hábitats con especies vulnerables y el papel de las prácticas de tenencia responsable, como mantener a los gatos en interiores o supervisados, esterilización y campañas de concienciación. Además, se discute el equilibrio entre bienestar animal y conservación, destacando la necesidad de enfoques integrados que involucren a comunidades, autoridades locales y científicos.

Baby examina cómo España y otras democracias occidentales han abordado, o eludido, la criminalización de los crímenes franquistas, resaltando que la Ley de Amnistía de 1977 paralizó cualquier intento serio de judicialización. La autora subraya la importancia de una visión global y comparada, alejada del nacional-centrismo, para entender el caso español, y critica tanto el déficit de políticas educativas sobre el periodo franquista como la falta de implicación de los gobiernos democráticos en la construcción de una verdadera memoria histórica. Baby denuncia el blanqueamiento del franquismo entre las nuevas generaciones, que, debido a la ignorancia y ausencia de memoria, pueden romantizar el régimen y adoptar discursos revisionistas alimentados desde ámbitos familiares y redes sociales.

Aunque Microsoft 365 es compatible con Open Document Format (ODF), los usuarios siguen enfrentándose a problemas de visualización y edición debido a incompatibilidades. Esta falta de interoperabilidad no solo afecta la accesibilidad actual, sino que pone en peligro la legibilidad de los documentos en el futuro. LibreOffice, junto con otras suites de código abierto, defiende el uso de ODF, un estándar abierto e interoperable que garantiza la preservación de los documentos a lo largo del tiempo, sin depender de un único proveedor. La crítica se centra en que Microsoft no proporciona suficiente transparencia sobre su formato propietario, lo que vincula a los usuarios a sus productos y puede hacer que los documentos sean inaccesibles en el futuro.

Ambos, hoy en la veintena de años de vida, superan registros anteriores y destacan por una relación marcada por la devoción y la correspondencia durante los años de servicio militar de Lyle en la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Eleanor recuerda cómo se conocieron en la Clark Atlanta University en 1941 y cómo él recibió un permiso de tres días para casarse, lo que les permitió celebrar su aniversario nupcial año tras año. Durante la guerra, ella dio a luz a su primer hijo y mantuvo el contacto con su marido a través de cartas, aunque estas quedaron parcialmente censuradas.

Partidarios de la propiedad pública sostienen que existen fundamentos históricos y legales para revertir la titularidad y proponen que el Ayuntamiento, con el respaldo de informes técnicos, podría emprender acciones judiciales para reclamar la titularidad para la ciudadanía. En 2018, una comisión de expertos encargada por el Ayuntamiento concluyó que la Iglesia no tiene ni puede tener título de propiedad sobre el inmueble y sugirió un modelo de gestión bajo un Patronato, relegando a la Iglesia a la rectoría del culto.

Este éxito se atribuye a factores como los lazos culturales y lingüísticos con América Latina, la flexibilización de políticas migratorias y la existencia de programas institucionales que facilitan la inserción social y laboral.

A diferencia de las cadenas privadas, estos establecimientos priorizarían el bienestar social por encima del lucro, remunerando adecuadamente tanto a los trabajadores como a los campesinos locales.

Se señala que la erosión de la confianza se ha agudado por experiencias judiciales controvertidas y por lo que se describe como intervenciones de intereses políticos en procesos judiciales, especialmente en contextos vinculados a figuras políticas relevantes en Madrid. Se argumenta que actos de investigación y testificaciones han generado dudas sobre la objetividad y el rigor de las investigaciones, alimentando una sensación de sesgo o interferencia política. El artículo discute episodios durante juicios, filtraciones de información y la gestión de pruebas, sugiriendo que estas dinámicas erosionan la credibilidad institucional.

Además, se ha formado e informado a más de 500 personas sobre sus derechos y sobre igualdad de trato. CEAR advierte de que los delitos de odio alcanzaron en 2023 su cifra más alta desde 2013, con 251 delitos en la Comunitat Valenciana, el 11 % del total nacional.

En comunidades como Madrid, la falta de titulados con el máster del profesorado ha llevado a abrir listas extraordinarias de interinos para cubrir vacantes en materias como Matemáticas, Física, Química o Lengua. Aunque esta medida se justifica como temporal, en la práctica se ha consolidado desde la pandemia de 2020, cuando el Ministerio de Educación permitió de forma excepcional que universitarios sin máster impartieran clase ante la escasez de sustitutos. El déficit docente, estimado en unos 46.000 profesores, afecta especialmente a ramas técnicas y a la Formación Profesional (FP), donde hasta un 20% del profesorado carece de la formación pedagógica exigida. Además, el máster del profesorado se ha convertido en un cuello de botella: la falta de plazas públicas y los altos precios de las privadas impiden que muchos titulados puedan cu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-docentes-cualificados-obliga-a-madrid-y-otras-comunidades-a-contratar-profesores-sin-el-master-habilitante</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-docentes-cualificados-obliga-a-madrid-y-otras-comunidades-a-contratar-profesores-sin-el-master-habilitante</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El cómic '7.291' denuncia el abandono de los mayores en las residencias madrileñas durante la pandemia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El cómic '7.291', creado por el guionista Raúl Cordero y el dibujante Boris Ramírez, da voz a las trabajadoras de residencias y a las familias de miles de mayores que murieron sin atención médica durante la pandemia de covid-19 en la Comunidad de Madrid. La obra, realizada en colaboración con la asociación 7.291: Verdad y Justicia, busca preservar la memoria y exigir responsabilidades por los llamados 'protocolos de la vergüenza', que impidieron el traslado hospitalario de residentes enfermos. Presentado en el Ateneo de Madrid, el proyecto recibió el apoyo de familiares de víctimas, como Mayte y Carmen Martín, quienes denunciaron la gestión política del Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso y defendieron la necesidad de justicia y reparación.

Los grupos que rechazaron la ILP fueron PNV, PSE-EE, PP y Vox, mientras EH Bildu y Sumar respaldaron la iniciativa. El objetivo de la ILP era modificar la legislación estatal para permitir a las comunidades autónomas establecer un Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI) aplicable en su territorio, posibilitando un SMI propio para Euskadi. Los defensores argumentaron que el salario mínimo vigente es insuficiente para salir de la pobreza y denunciaron bloqueo democrático; por su parte, los opositores adujeron riesgos de desincentivar el empleo y crear desigualdades interterritoriales.

Su análisis abarca las diferencias entre provincias, dialectos y tradiciones culturales, subrayando la necesidad de entender a Andalucía como un mosaico cultural. En su discurso de ingreso a la Real Academia de Doctores de España (2016) continuó poniendo el foco en la realidad andaluza, destacando que la movilidad de intelectuales entre Madrid y otras regiones ha sido un fenómeno significativo a lo largo del siglo XX.

Este fenómeno ocurre en condiciones ambientales normales, sin necesidad de calor, presión o procesos industriales, lo que sugiere que ciertas plantas pueden actuar como “laboratorios químicos” biológicos. El mineral cristalizado se concentra en elementos clave para tecnologías modernas como cerio, lantano y neodimio, que son fundamentales para imanes, láseres y dispositivos ópticos, entre otros. Este hallazgo implica que ciertos hiperacumuladores vegetales pueden almacenar y organizar metales a concentraciones mucho mayores que las del suelo, abriendo la posibilidad de obtener tierras raras sin minería intensiva. Además, se plantea un modelo circular sostenible: cultivar plantas en suelos metalizados para extraer minerales y, al mismo tiempo, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-helecho-produce-tierras-raras-sin-mineria-revolucion-o-prototipo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-helecho-produce-tierras-raras-sin-mineria-revolucion-o-prototipo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 22:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Batida neonazi en la Complutense: el campus resiste la provocación de Vito Quiles]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe un acto organizado por el agitador de extrema derecha Vito Quiles en el campus Somosaguas de la Universidad Complutense que recibió una respuesta contundente por parte de la comunidad universitaria.

Rosa Álvarez y Toñi García subrayaron que las puertas de las instituciones europeas se abren con frecuencia, mientras que en las Corts, según ellas, “se las han cerrado” a las víctimas.

Esta medida, que inicialmente estaba prevista para 2028, se adelantará a 2026, con el objetivo de frenar el colapso de las aduanas debido a la exención de aranceles que se había convertido en un coladero. Cada año, Europa recibe millones de paquetes de bajo valor sin impuestos, lo que perjudica a las empresas locales. El 65% de estos paquetes tienen precios artificialmente bajos para evitar los aranceles. Además de la moda, otros sectores como el juguetero también se han visto afectados. El acuerdo también implica que la UE abrirá un centro de datos aduaneros para facilitar el intercambio de información entre los países miembros y asegurar que se paguen los impuestos correspondientes.

Este encuentro marcó la primera reunión entre un mandatario sirio y un presidente estadounidense desde 1946, tras la independencia de Siria. Durante la recepción en el Despacho Oval, Trump obsequió dos frascos de su exclusiva fragancia 'Victory 45-47' a al-Sharaa, uno masculino y otro femenino. En un gesto que sorprendió a los presentes, Trump roció personalmente el perfume en el cuello del líder sirio y le ofreció otro frasco para su esposa, preguntando en tono jocoso cuántas esposas tenía.

Este comportamiento eleva el ritmo de crecimiento de las emisiones respecto a 2023 y supera la línea roja de los objetivos de 1,5°C. El estudio alerta que el presupuesto restante de carbono para mantener el calentamiento bajo 1,5°C podría agotarse antes de 2030 si las tendencias actuales continúan.

La secretaria de Prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, confirmó que Virginia Giuffre, una exempleada de Mar-a-Lago, era la persona mencionada en los correos electrónicos del fallecido pederasta. La administración negó cualquier implicación de Trump en delitos y acusó a los demócratas de filtrar selectivamente información para desacreditar al presidente, en un intento de desviar la atención de otros asuntos políticos. Los correos en cuestión sugieren que Epstein afirmó que Trump sabía de las actividades de tráfico sexual y que pasaba horas en su casa con una víctima, aunque Trump no figura como remitente ni destinatario directo de estos mensajes, y no hay cargos en su contra.

En Greenland, Alaska, Siberia y Canadá, se utilizaban intestinos de mamíferos como fibra clave para crear tejidos ligeros y resistentes al agua. La estructura natural de los intestinos permitía que una cara repelerá la lluvia y la otra facilitara la evaporación del sudor, gracias a microperforaciones que bloqueaban el agua pero dejaban pasar la humedad. El proceso incluía limpiar, inflar y secar los intestinos, cortarlos en tiras y unirlas con costuras especiales para lograr un tejido impermeable. Aunque la prenda resultaba extremadamente liviana, con ejemplos que pesan apenas 85 gramos, su valor residía en la protección que ofrecía en condiciones árticas extremas, especialmente para cazadores que viajaban en kayaks. Las comunidades Inupiat, asentadas en el Ártico desde hace unos 4.000 años, figur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ropa-impermeable-ancestral-tecnicas-indigenas-para-sobrevivir-al-frio-artico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ropa-impermeable-ancestral-tecnicas-indigenas-para-sobrevivir-al-frio-artico</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 13:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[👏EL FMI LO ADMITE: La austeridad NO reduce la deuda pública 💰 Y además propone impagarla!! 🤯]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo aborda una declaración del Fondo Monetario Internacional en la que se admite que las políticas de austeridad no son eficaces para reducir la deuda pública.

En un futuro distópico, un grupo de jóvenes participa en una caminata sin descanso en la que, si se detienen o reducen la velocidad, enfrentan la muerte. La película no solo muestra la dureza de la prueba física, sino que explora la crítica a una sociedad que ha transformado el sufrimiento en entretenimiento. Con una estética que recuerda a los años 70 y un ritmo narrativo que no ofrece pausas, Lawrence utiliza el agotamiento como una herramienta de horror. Los personajes enfrentan la muerte de manera estoica, rebelde, religiosa o delirante, pero todos comparten la opresión de un sistema que les exige resistencia constante.

La empresa desvió el trabajo a otros centros con el fin de minimizar los efectos de la huelga, lo que constituye esquirolaje organizativo, una práctica ilegal. A pesar de que Lidl alegó que su modelo logístico es flexible, el tribunal determinó que los desvíos no tenían justificación organizativa.

En una entrevista reciente con la cadena pública ZDF, Chrupalla, quien ha sido señalado por sus vínculos con Rusia, defendió su postura de que Rusia no es una amenaza para Alemania. Sin embargo, al ser interrogado sobre las acciones híbridas de Rusia contra los estados europeos, Chrupalla subrayó que cualquier país podría ser una amenaza para Alemania. A continuación, sugirió que Polonia, al no extraditar a un presunto criminal ucraniano involucrado en el sabotaje de los gasoductos Nord Stream, podría ser una amenaza para su país. Estas declaraciones fueron rápidamente condenadas por políticos de otras formaciones, como Roderich Kiesewetter del CDU, que criticó a la AfD por su apoyo implícito a Putin. La polémica refleja las tensiones dentro de la política alemana, especialmente con respecto a las relaciones con Rusia y Polonia.

A diferencia de otras producciones de DC, esta adaptación buscaría distanciarse de la continuidad actual de DC Studios y se inscribiría en un formato que respeta la esencia distópica y el tono crítico del material original. El proyecto cuenta con Pete Jackson como guionista, un profesional con experiencia reciente en la industria británica y con buena recepción en proyectos previos, como Somewhere Boy, que fue distinguida con nominaciones BAFTA. Aunque Channel 4 había explorado una adaptación previa, Variety ha señalado que HBO podría reiniciar los planes y gestionar el desarrollo sin mantener vínculos directos con las últimas propuestas de DC para otros títulos.

El porcentaje de familias cuyos ingresos no cubren sus gastos pasó del 48% al 31% en un solo año. Esta caída es más evidente en los sectores más vulnerables, donde ha mejorado la capacidad de afrontar necesidades básicas como la compra de útiles escolares, ropa y servicios médicos. A pesar de estos avances, persiste un importante desafío relacionado con el endeudamiento, especialmente entre los hogares de clase media, con un aumento del 8% en el porcentaje de familias con deudas. Aunque la pobreza infantil ha descendido, todavía afecta al 46,1% de los niños, y la pobreza extrema al 10,2%.

Este carné digital se integraría en la identidad digital europea, lo que permitiría un seguimiento más exhaustivo de los conductores. Además, se plantean cursos de reciclaje para conductores mayores de 65 años, que aunque por ahora son voluntarios, se teme que puedan convertirse en obligatorios con el tiempo.

La Ley Mordaza, en vigor desde 2015, ha sido criticada por otorgar a las fuerzas de seguridad el poder de imponer sanciones sin un proceso judicial previo, y a pesar de los compromisos del gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, aún no ha sido derogada ni reformada de manera significativa. Esta nueva sanción subraya los riesgos que enfrentan los periodistas en España cuando intentan informar sobre situaciones controvertidas, como los desahucios y la actuación policial ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sancionan-a-un-fotoperiodista-por-informar-sobre-un-desahucio-bajo-la-ley-mordaza</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sancionan-a-un-fotoperiodista-por-informar-sobre-un-desahucio-bajo-la-ley-mordaza</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, indultado por Trump, condenado a prisión por violar su libertad condicional tras ser acusado de abusos físicos y sexuales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Jonathan Braun, un narcotraficante que fue liberado gracias al indulto de Donald Trump en 2021, ha sido condenado nuevamente a 27 meses de prisión tras violar los términos de su libertad condicional. El motivo de su reincidencia fueron las acusaciones de abuso físico y sexual. Braun, de 42 años, fue acusado de agredir sexualmente a la niñera de sus hijos, a quien sometió a un ataque violento. Además, se le acusa de agredir a un niño de tres años y de amenazar a varias personas en diferentes situaciones. A pesar de la segunda oportunidad que recibió tras el indulto presidencial, Braun no cumplió con las expectativas de reinserción social, lo que ha llevado a su condena. Esta es la octava persona que recibe un perdón o reducción de sentencia por parte de Trump y luego incurre en nuevos delitos. El tribunal también le ha impuesto tratamiento de rehabilitación para su abuso de drogas y problemas mentales. La decisión de Trump de concederle el indulto ha sido cuestionada en este nuevo conte]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-indultado-por-trump-condenado-a-prision-por-violar-su-libertad-condicional-tras-ser-acusado-de-abusos-fisicos-y-sexuales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jonathan-braun-indultado-por-trump-condenado-a-prision-por-violar-su-libertad-condicional-tras-ser-acusado-de-abusos-fisicos-y-sexuales</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rufián critica la conexión de la derecha judicial en el caso del fiscal general]]></title><description><![CDATA[El caso del fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, ha generado polémica tras su implicación en la filtración de un correo electrónico relacionado con Alberto González Amador, novio de Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Gabriel Rufián, diputado de Esquerra Republicana, ha resumido el caso durante su intervención en el Congreso, destacando que el fiscal está siendo juzgado por un juez cercano al Partido Popular y por una fiscal vinculada a la presidenta madrileña, Ayuso. Rufián acusa a la derecha judicial de manipular el proceso judicial y critica la falta de investigación de los casos de corrupción y las muertes en las residencias de mayores en Madrid. En su intervención, también recomendó al fiscal general hacerse militante del PP para evitar problemas, dada la composición política de los implicados.

Sánchez recordó el relevo de Feijóo al frente del PP tras la intensa rivalidad con Ayuso y, en tono humorístico, afirmó que el dirigente gallego 'manda menos que Jar Jar Binks en el Senado Galáctico', usando una referencia a La Guerra de las Galaxias para subrayar su punto. El comentario ilustra la complicada relación interna dentro del PP, marcada por luchas de poder y tensiones sobre la autonomía de las federaciones regionales. La intervención de Sánchez ha generado repercusión mediática, al poner en evidencia las diferencias entre la dirección nacional del PP y su federación en Madrid, y se enmarca en una estrategia política donde el Gobierno central busca subrayar las debilidades del principal partido de la oposición.

A pesar de que la iniciativa presentada por el grupo municipal de IU-Equo fue rechazada en ese momento por PP, Ciudadanos, Vox y Pmas, la medida fue finalmente aprobada en 2024. La polémica se reavivó cuando, en 2024, Navarro realizó comentarios controvertidos sobre la Memoria Histórica, en los que restó importancia a los eventos históricos relacionados con la Guerra Civil, lo que provocó críticas de la oposición. A pesar de este historial, Moreno Bonilla ha ratificado su confianza en Navarro, quien también ocupa el cargo de vicepresidente de la Diputación de Granada y es un referente dentro del PP local.

La marcha, convocada por Familiares y Amigxs de Carlos, recorrió los barrios de Usera y Legazpi, lugar del crimen, bajo el lema '18 años sin ti, 18 años contigo'. Los asistentes corearon consignas como 'Carlos vive, la lucha sigue' y 'Madrid será la tumba del fascismo'. Además de recordar a Palomino, la manifestación hizo hincapié en el auge del fascismo en España, señalando que la lucha sigue viva. En su intervención, los organizadores subrayaron que el mejor homenaje a Carlos es continuar con la resistencia contra la violencia fascista, haciendo un llamado a mantener la memoria histórica frente a los intentos de normalizar la ideología neonazi.

Durante su intervención, Sánchez ha exigido a los gobiernos autonómicos del PP la entrega de datos sobre la gestión de la sanidad, la educación y la dependencia, y ha subrayado que estos serán analizados y puestos a disposición del público. También ha denunciado el proceso privatizador que, según él, afecta a las residencias de mayores en varias regiones gobernadas por el PP.

Mona al-Harazeen, una mujer gazatí, recuerda con dolor la pérdida de su hijo Yazan, quien murió en un ataque aéreo israelí. Mona regresa al norte de Gaza, donde pasó la mayor parte de su vida, para enterrar a su hijo. Aunque la guerra ha dejado su casa destruida, Mona se enfrenta a precios exorbitantes de productos básicos, como alimentos, y a la falta de recursos esenciales. Muchas familias siguen cocinando sobre hogueras, y la escasez de gas empeora la situación. Jumana, otra mujer de Gaza, relata cómo, a pesar de la tragedia, su familia intenta recuperar una pequeña normalidad, como darles a sus hijas clases privadas. Sin embargo, la vida sigue siendo extremadamente difícil, con la esperanza de reconstruir la vida en Gaza cada vez más distante.

Esta práctica, conocida como el ‘primer sueño’ y ‘segundo sueño’, no solo era habitual en Europa, sino también en otras partes del mundo, y tenía un impacto significativo en la percepción del tiempo. Sin embargo, con el avance de la iluminación artificial y la Revolución Industrial, el hábito de dormir en dos turnos fue reemplazado por un sueño continuo de ocho horas. Los expertos sugieren que esta transformación ha alterado nuestra relación con el descanso y el paso del tiempo, ya que la exposición continua a la luz artificial afecta nuestro ritmo circadiano. Aunque este cambio parece ser relativamente reciente, investigaciones muestran que en algunas comunidades sin acceso a electricidad, como en Madagascar, las personas siguen manteniendo esta práctica.

Las universidades públicas andaluzas ya enfrentan una asfixia financiera, con recortes en presupuestos y una creciente precarización del profesorado. A pesar de los informes que destacan la eficacia y el impacto económico de las universidades públicas, la LUPA no establece garantías para una financiación adecuada y abre la puerta a la mercantilización de la educación.

De esta forma, se reduce la responsabilidad de las entidades bancarias, que solo deben derivar al cliente a las fuentes públicas. Además, el Supremo señala que cada caso será evaluado de forma individual y que los jueces deberán considerar la transparencia con que se comercializó el préstamo.

Este límite implica que el 40% restante se factura al precio del periodo punta, lo que contradice la interpretación de la oferta tal como se presentaba en la web de la empresa.

En estos casos, dos familias fueron expulsadas de sus hogares sin el aviso correspondiente, lo que infringe la legislación vigente, como la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Civil y la Ley Estatal de Vivienda, que prohíben estos desalojos.

En una entrevista, Rubiales explicó que el beso fue un acto de emoción y que en ningún momento tuvo connotaciones sexuales. Aseguró que no pedía perdón a Jenni Hermoso, ya que ella aceptó el gesto en el momento, aunque reconoció que no estuvo bien desde un punto de vista institucional. Además, Rubiales criticó el tratamiento mediático y político que se dio a su gesto, afirmando que fue utilizado como una 'cortina de humo' por parte de Pedro Sánchez y la extrema izquierda para desviar la atención de otros temas políticos. También mencionó las presiones que recibió de diversos actores, incluido el presidente de la Federación, Luis de la Fuente, y el conflicto con Javier Tebas.

Los autores sostienen que los océanos han sido clave para el desarrollo del capitalismo global, facilitando rutas comerciales, explotación de recursos y estructuras laborales racializadas, al tiempo que la soberanía del mar ha sido objeto de constantes mecanismos de apropiación: banderas de conveniencia, zonas económicas exclusivas y privatización de recursos. Se analizan conceptos como la “ficción” del mar como espacio sin ley, que permite justificaciones legales y culturales para la privatización y el uso intensivo de los océanos. La conversación aborda temas como la soberanía marítima, la regulación internacional y los retos para hacer cumplir el derecho internacional frente a actores estatales y corporativos.

La propuesta incluía un impuesto aplicable a la acumulación de bienes inmuebles a partir de la tercera residencia y cambios para las socimi (Sociedades Anónimas Cotizadas de Inversión en el Mercado Inmobiliario).

Además, 187 personas perdieron la vida por ataques de elefantes el mismo año, el número más elevado en la historia reciente. La situación sigue empeorando, y los expertos consideran que se trata de una tragedia nacional.

Según Sánchez, el empresario le ha exigido en reiteradas ocasiones que eliminase la noticia sobre sus prácticas fraudulentas, llegando a proferir amenazas como 'te voy a hundir' o 'no me conoces y me vas a encontrar'. Estas amenazas habrían sido dirigidas a intimidar a Sánchez por la denuncia pública sobre los fraudes cometidos.

El periodista ha señalado que estos senadores no están representando a los electores, sino a los intereses económicos que financian sus campañas. Para Fesser, esta acción fue un golpe a la oportunidad de los demócratas de plantar cara a Donald Trump y defender el seguro médico de millones de estadounidenses. A pesar de la oposición interna, los demócratas votaron en su mayoría para evitar que 14 millones de personas se quedaran sin seguro médico, pero la decisión final de algunos senadores fue vista como una traición a los principios del partido.

Durante el sitio, los civiles de Sarajevo estaban atrapados y sometidos al fuego constante de los soldados serbobosnios. La investigación busca identificar a los responsables de estos crímenes, que podrían ser procesados por homicidio múltiple con agravantes de crueldad y motivos abyectos.

Contrariamente a la creencia popular de que los jefes agresivos y egoístas suelen llegar más alto, la investigación concluye que las personas con rasgos como la manipulación, la agresividad y el egoísmo no alcanzan posiciones de poder más fácilmente que quienes son generosos y agradables. Aunque la intimidación puede generar miedo y aparentemente aumentar el poder, estos rasgos también dificultan la creación de alianzas y relaciones laborales positivas, lo que neutraliza cualquier ventaja. El estudio, longitudinal y realizado con más de 600 estudiantes estadounidenses, muestra que la extraversión y la sociabilidad sí están asociadas a mejores oportunidades de ascenso.

Abraham cayó al suelo y, aunque intentó levantarse, fue inmovilizado hasta la llegada de la Guardia Civil. Poco después, sufrió una parada cardiorrespiratoria y murió.

Los resultados mostraron que aquellos que tomaron melatonina durante al menos un año presentaron un riesgo un 89% mayor de sufrir insuficiencia cardíaca en comparación con los que no usaron este suplemento. Este hallazgo plantea dudas sobre la seguridad del uso prolongado de la melatonina, especialmente considerando que no se han realizado ensayos clínicos que avalen su consumo a largo plazo.

El objetivo de esta medida es reducir el paro en las islas, que se encuentra en torno al 15%, y abordar la falta de mano de obra que sufren algunas empresas. La Consejería de Turismo y Empleo de Canarias pretende seguir el ejemplo de otras comunidades autónomas como Galicia y Asturias, que ya aplican sanciones por rechazar ofertas laborales, lo que puede implicar la pérdida temporal de la prestación por desempleo. Además, se están evaluando medidas con la Consejería de Sanidad para agilizar las altas laborales, permitiendo que sean los especialistas quienes den el alta sin necesidad de pasar por el médico de cabecera. Esta propuesta tiene como fin reducir el absentismo laboral en las islas, que según la CEOE de Tenerife, alcanza un coste de más de 1.300 millones de euros al año.

Esta medida, anunciada en un comunicado oficial, activa una fase superior del 'Plan Independencia 200', un mecanismo defensivo ordenado por Nicolás Maduro. El incremento de la alerta coincide con la llegada del portaaviones estadounidense 'Gerald Ford' a la región, cuyo objetivo declarado es combatir el narcotráfico y desmantelar organizaciones criminales transnacionales. Las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela se encuentran en máxima alerta y se dispone a desplegar todos los medios militares, incluyendo fuerzas terrestres, aéreas y navales.

A lo largo de los años, el expresidente no ha dudado en alardear de los acabados dorados que adornan el despacho presidencial, incluso asegurando que son de oro real. Sin embargo, la polémica surgió cuando se descubrió que algunos de estos adornos dorados se parecen demasiado a las molduras de plástico dorado de la marca Ekena Millwork, que se venden en Home Depot a un precio accesible. Esta controversia estalló cuando, durante una entrevista en Fox News, la presentadora Laura Ingraham cuestionó directamente si las decoraciones eran de la tienda de mejoras para el hogar. Trump negó la acusación, asegurando que sus adornos no provenían de Home Depot, a pesar de las similitudes evidentes. BuzzFeed contactó con Ekena Millwork, quienes confirmaron que su producto podría ser el mismo utilizado en la Casa Blanca.

Sin embargo, la Santa Sede no la aceptó debido a una denuncia por abusos sexuales presentada por una víctima, quien asegura que los hechos ocurrieron hace tres décadas, cuando Zornoza era rector en el Seminario de Getafe. Aunque aún no se ha abierto un proceso canónico contra él, el Vaticano ha comenzado una investigación interna. Expertos canonistas señalan la falta de medidas cautelares en un caso que ya está en manos del Tribunal de la Rota, único tribunal eclesiástico con jurisdicción en España. Aunque no se han tomado decisiones definitivas, se rumorea que el relevo de Zornoza podría ocurrir antes de que llegue el nuevo nuncio a España, previsto para diciembre. La Conferencia Episcopal ha expresado respeto por los procedimientos y ha afirmado que la investigación será exhaustiva.

Su predecessor, Joan Llinares, recibió alrededor de 65.000 euros brutos anuales. Este incremento está relacionado con cambios legislativos aprobados por el PP y Vox en 2024 que conectaron su salario al puesto de alto cargo en la Generalitat, estableciendo límites y condiciones para evitar pérdidas salariales al trasladarse desde otras administraciones. En concreto, la normativa impuso que ningún alto cargo guarde más del 15% del salario del presidente autonómico (con un tope de 92.000 euros) y que, para la agencia, las cantidades mínimas a percibir no fueran inferiores a las retribuciones previas. Estas medidas permitieron que el salario de Beut alcance casi 98.000 euros, dada su condición de delegado especial anterior en la Agencia Tributaria.

García Ortiz se encuentra en el banquillo acusado de filtrar un correo del abogado de Alberto González Amador, un empresario vinculado a la corrupción y a la evasión fiscal. Sin embargo, el escándalo no es que García Ortiz filtrara el correo, sino que el material ya circulaba entre los medios antes de llegar a la Fiscalía. Mientras el acusado de fraude, González Amador, se presenta como víctima de una conspiración, el asesor Miguel Ángel Rodríguez (MAR), encargado de propagar los rumores, es el verdadero instigador de la falsedad. La situación resalta un sistema judicial que, en lugar de perseguir la verdad, parece estar al servicio de una narrativa política que manipula los hechos en su beneficio.

Las autoridades indicaron que no hubo víctimas y que el cierre previo de la vía, debido a grietas y movimientos del terreno, permitió evitar pérdidas humanas. El colapso ocurrió poco después de su inauguración y ha generado preocupación sobre la seguridad de grandes obras en zonas propensas a movimientos geológicos, especialmente en regiones montañosas del suroeste chino. Equipos técnicos de Sichuan y del Ministerio de Transporte se encuentran investigando las causas, mientras se evalúa la estabilidad de estructuras cercanas y se recuperan escombros.

Aunque esta cifra se convirtió en un estándar de referencia, en realidad no representaba la capacidad real del disquete, sino una convención técnica y de marketing. Los disquetes de alta densidad podían almacenar datos en 80 pistas por cara, con dos caras grabables y 18 sectores por pista. Cada sector contenía 512 bytes, lo que daba un total de 1.474.560 bytes. Sin embargo, se utilizó el sistema binario y decimal para redondear esta cifra, resultando en los 1,44 MB. Este límite de almacenamiento obligó a los usuarios a comprimir o dividir archivos, lo que hizo que cada megabyte fuera valioso en aquella época. Aunque el formato fue reemplazado rápidamente por CDs y USBs, el disquete de 1,44 MB se mantuvo como un símbolo de la era digital temprana. Hoy en día, la comparación entre la capacidad de aquellos disquetes y los actuales gigabytes y terabytes pone de manifiesto el enorme a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-de-la-capacidad-de-1-44-mb-de-los-disquetes-de-3-5-pulgadas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-origen-de-la-capacidad-de-1-44-mb-de-los-disquetes-de-3-5-pulgadas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 06:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aviso G4 (Severo) en vigor para el 12 de noviembre debido a CME y tormenta solar]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) de NOAA mantiene un aviso de tormenta geomagnética de nivel G4 (Severo) para el 12 de noviembre. Este aviso surge a raíz de eyecciones de masa coronal (CME) que se han observado en los días previos y que persisten en dirección hacia la Tierra. El conjunto actual de Watches indica niveles modulares para el 11 y el 13 de noviembre, con el 12 de noviembre como el pico potencial. La CME más reciente, asociada a una llamarada solar de clase X5.1, alcanzó su punto máximo a las 10:04 UTC del 11 de noviembre, y está acompañada por una tormenta de radiación solar de nivel S2. Los pronósticos señalan que la mayoría de la ejecta se dirige hacia el norte y por delante de la órbita terrestre, lo que complica la predicción precisa del momento exacto de llegada y su intensidad.

Esta filtración ha expuesto la profunda dependencia de Rusia respecto a tecnología extranjera, así como las dificultades de su industria para mantenerse autónoma. El PAK DA, que se había diseñado para reemplazar a los veteranos Tu-95 y Tu-160, está plagado de retrasos y problemas de producción, además de depender de maquinaria extranjera para su construcción. La filtración incluye detalles de sistemas cruciales, como el sistema hidráulico utilizado en el compartimento de bombas del PAK DA, y confirma que el proyecto se enfrenta a serios obstáculos debido a las sanciones y la falta de piezas.

Mientras que una sonda convencional como la UOP tomaría entre 13 y 14 años para llegar a Urano, un estudio del MIT sugiere que la Starship de SpaceX podría reducir ese tiempo a solo 6,5 años. Esto se lograría mediante aerocaptura en la atmósfera de Urano, una maniobra arriesgada pero eficiente. La Starship, gracias a su capacidad de repostaje en órbita, podría alcanzar cualquier rincón del Sistema Solar con menores costos, aunque se deben resolver varios desafíos tecnológicos, como el manejo de propelentes durante largos periodos y la resistencia del escudo térmico durante la aerocaptura.

Sin embargo, el impacto real sobre el crecimiento económico no es tan claro. En un nuevo estudio, se reevaluaron los efectos de estos megaeventos en 147 países entre 1991 y 2023, analizando variables como el turismo, el empleo en el sector servicios y el PIB per cápita. Aunque en algunos casos hubo un leve aumento en el empleo y el turismo durante los eventos, los beneficios no fueron duraderos ni significativos. Los Juegos Olímpicos mostraron un leve aumento en el PIB per cápita, pero los Mundiales no mostraron impacto alguno en este aspecto. Además, los efectos variaron según el país y el evento. En general, los megaeventos deportivos generan algunos beneficios temporales, pero los costes son elevados y los efectos suelen ser limitados a corto plazo.
