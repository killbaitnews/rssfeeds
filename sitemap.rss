Interviewing more than 75 employees, inspectors noted that retaliation concerns led many to avoid online anonymous reporting, instead channeling concerns through union representatives. The report also highlighted a spike in anonymous safety complaints at St. Lucie in 2024, with 20 allegations—far higher than any other U.S. plant—raising alarms about a chilled work environment. Regulators had previously identified ongoing safety-cultural problems at both St. Lucie and the nearby Turkey Point plants, including past incidents of management undervaluing safety. Advocates warn that such culture can contribute to outages and safety risks, especially as the utility pursues a record-setting rate increase request. Florida Power & Light contends that its operations are safe and that measures have been taken to address issues,]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-nuclear-plants-facing-safety-culture-concerns-as-workers-hesitate-to-raise-issues</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-nuclear-plants-facing-safety-culture-concerns-as-workers-hesitate-to-raise-issues</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU faces funding gaps as ECB declines to guarantee Ukraine loans]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that the European Central Bank (ECB) has refused to guarantee loans to Ukraine, complicating Brussels' plan to establish a financing mechanism to sustain Ukraine during the war. It notes a proposed €140 billion ‘reparations loan’ for Ukraine, intended to be funded by nearly €200 billion of frozen Russian assets held by Euroclear, and to be repaid when Russia pays reparations (which is unlikely). The piece argues that without an asset seizure mechanism, member states may need to provide bilateral subsidies or seek a joint loan. It quotes EU leaders and officials urging progress, including Christine Lagarde and Kaja Kallas, who advocate confiscating frozen Russian assets to bolster EU leverage in negotiations with Moscow. The ECB reportedly warns that confiscating Russian funds could undermine confidence in the euro and pose risks to banks across the euro area. The article also mentions Luxembourg and Belgium as examples of legal resistance to asset seizure due to bil]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-faces-funding-gaps-as-ecb-declines-to-guarantee-ukraine-loans</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-faces-funding-gaps-as-ecb-declines-to-guarantee-ukraine-loans</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notable Artistic Representations of the Nativity Through Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article '24 Famous Paintings of the Nativity Scene' presents an overview of some of the most celebrated artistic depictions of the birth of Jesus Christ throughout art history. It explores works from the Renaissance to the modern era, showcasing how various painters across centuries and regions have interpreted this central Christian theme. Each artwork reflects not only religious reverence but also cultural and stylistic shifts in visual storytelling. The selection includes masterpieces by renowned artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, El Greco, Caravaggio, and Gerard van Honthorst. These works differ in composition, symbolism, and emotional tone—ranging from serene, intimate portrayals of Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus, to grand, ornate scenes filled with angels, shepherds, and magi. The article emphasizes how the Nativity has remained an enduring motif, offering insight into the spiritual and artistic values of different eras.

Using 2025 data from Numbeo, the study blends city centre and outer-area rental prices to compute an average monthly rent, then compares it to the average salary to determine affordability. The results show a wide gap in affordability across cities: in some cases, rent consumes a substantial portion of income, with Portugal highlighted as the least affordable (around 95% of average earnings needed for a one-bedroom). Conversely, Switzerland (Bern) emerges as relatively affordable, with rents around 24% of the average salary. The report notes regional disparities, with Eastern, Southeastern, and Southern European cities often requiring 50% or more of income for rent, and identifies Berlin, Vienna, Helsinki, Brussels, and Riga as relatively more manageable where approximately one-third of income goes to rent. The analysis emphasizes the challenge for individuals who]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-city-housing-affordability-how-much-of-the-average-salary-goes-to-rent-a-one-bedroom-apartment</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-city-housing-affordability-how-much-of-the-average-salary-goes-to-rent-a-one-bedroom-apartment</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[<A non-clickbait, descriptive title>]]></title><description><![CDATA[<A rewrite of the article between 200 and 500 words highlighting the main points.>]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-non-clickbait-descriptive-title</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-non-clickbait-descriptive-title</guid><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 05:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[25 Worst Villains of the Trump Admin: A ranked critique of top appointments in 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[A reader-supported piece published on December 26, 2025 provides a ranked list of what the author describes as the 25 “worst villains” from the Trump administration, focusing strictly on individuals who were appointed during Trump’s tenure. The compilation is arranged from #25 up to #1, with detailed descriptions for each figure. Notable entries include James Blair, nicknamed ‘The Enforcer’, accused of enforcing loyalty through threats and orchestrating gerrymandering; Doug Burgum for policies favoring fossil fuels and land openings on federal property; Doug Collins associated with significant VA staffing cuts and privatization push; Kevin Hassett criticized for blaming economic harms on others and promoting administration propaganda; Linda McMahon for large-scale layoffs at the Department of Education; Brooke Rollins for alignment with Big Ag and proposals to cut SNAP benefits; Tulsi Gabbard accused of anti-U.S. or Putin-friendly positions; Brendan Carr and Karoline Leavitt for media ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/25-worst-villains-of-the-trump-admin-a-ranked-critique-of-top-appointments-in-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/25-worst-villains-of-the-trump-admin-a-ranked-critique-of-top-appointments-in-2025</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China sets world speed record for maglev propulsion by reaching 700 km/h in two seconds]]></title><description><![CDATA[China has achieved a historic milestone in magnetic levitation (maglev) technology by accelerating a ton-scale test vehicle to 700 kilometers per hour in only two seconds on a 400-meter test track. The breakthrough was reported by China Media Group and involved a superconducting electric maglev vehicle developed by a research team from the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). After reaching the high speed, the vehicle performed a controlled, safe stop, marking the fastest speed ever recorded on a maglev platform of this kind. The accomplishment is described as the result of a decade of intensive R&D, overcoming challenges such as ultra-high-speed electromagnetic propulsion, electric suspension guidance, transient high-power energy storage and inversion, and high-field superconducting magnets. The report emphasizes maglev technology’s potential to lift and guide trains without wheels, enabling near-frictionless travel and new applications in vacuum-tube maglev systems, aero]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-sets-world-speed-record-for-maglev-propulsion-by-reaching-700-km-h-in-two-seconds</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-sets-world-speed-record-for-maglev-propulsion-by-reaching-700-km-h-in-two-seconds</guid><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivalry Between Saudi Arabia and UAE Intensifies as Yemen Crisis Expands Toward the Persian Gulf]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports a notable escalation in Middle East tensions, focusing on Saudi airstrikes against a Yemen-based faction supported by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Saudi-led coalition targeted elite units in Hadramaut, a province bordering Saudi Arabia, amid the Southern Transitional Council's (STC) offensive to seize Hadramaut and parts of Al Mahra. The STC, backed by the UAE, seeks greater autonomy or independence for southern Yemen, complicating Riyadh's influence and destabilizing the internationally recognized Yemeni government. The piece links this military dynamic to broader Gulf rivalries, suggesting a growing strategic rift between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over regional power, including Sudan, where UAE concerns about rapid-reinforcement forces and the role of paramilitary groups are noted. Saudi authorities condemned the STC’s advances as unilateral and detrimental to Yemeni interests.

The incident occurred as the boy and his mother were walking near the farmer’s property. The child sustained severe injuries, including broken legs, and was transported to hospital for surgery. The mother described hearing the farmer shout before the assault, and stated that he claimed he would repeat the act. Stoman was arrested and appeared in the Vredendal Magistrate’s Court on charges of attempted murder and reckless driving. Local residents have raised concerns about repeated incidents of farm-related crime, prompting calls for stricter penalties for perpetrators. The State indicated it would oppose bail, citing safety and ongoing investigations. The mother emphasized the ongoing recovery process for her son and the potential need for counseling.

After enlisting in the Marines at a young age, he served in multiple conflicts, earned a Purple Heart, and returned to civilian life as a port worker in New York. In a bar conversation, he accepted a dare to see if he could fly from New Jersey to New York City in under fifteen minutes. He seized a twinkling moment of audacity, carjacked a small Cessna 140 from Teterboro Airport, and piloted it to Manhattan while intoxicated, landing in the Saint Nicholas Avenue area near his friends’ bar. Authorities briefly detained him for aircraft theft, but the owner chose not to press charges; he paid a small municipal fine. Two years later, Fitzpatrick repeated the feat, landing near the same bar. This time, legal consequences were harsher: six months in prison for transporting stolen goods, though the owner again declined to pursue charges.

The findings, documented by Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation in collaboration with Panthera, recorded 29 detections of the species. This species is among the world's most endangered felines, typically inhabiting dense wetland ecosystems such as peat swamps and mangrove connections. The survey also documented a female flat-headed cat with her cub, an encouraging sign given that flat-headed cats often give birth to a single kitten. However, researchers caution that counting individuals is difficult due to the lack of distinctive markings on individuals. Habitat fragmentation and loss of peat swamp forests, driven by land conversion and agriculture, remain critical threats, as do disease pressures from domestic ani]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rediscovery-of-endangered-flat-headed-cat-in-thailand-signals-conservation-urgency</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[France trains soldiers in Ukraine to operate drones amid evolving warfare]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that French soldiers are traveling to Ukraine to learn drone piloting, citing Paris Match as the source. It notes that in Donbas, AI-controlled drones are increasingly used for reconnaissance and logistics disruption, signaling a shift in modern warfare and raising questions about human roles on the battlefield. An interviewee described receiving training in France in 2023 with the French Foreign Legion, and now trains visitors from the French army already in Ukraine. The piece emphasizes the sensitive political nature of French involvement, referencing Ukrainian Army Commander Oleksandr Syrskyi’s past mention of an agreement to deploy French instructors, while President Macron stated France would not send ground troops to a belligerent conflict. The French Foreign Ministry reportedly denied reports of French forces on Ukrainian soil, and Macron reportedly authorized European peacekeeping forces in Ukraine only after peace is achieved.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-trains-soldiers-in-ukraine-to-operate-drones-amid-evolving-warfare</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[1,400-Year-Old Souvenir Mold Reveals Scale of Byzantine Christian Pilgrimage Trade]]></title><description><![CDATA[Archaeologists excavating the Hyrcania site in the Judean Desert have uncovered a rare limestone two-part mold used to cast ampullae, small pilgrimage flasks, dating to the 6th–7th centuries CE. Decorated with an ornate cross and bearing a Greek inscription meaning “Lord’s blessing from the holy places,” these flasks likely contained sacred oils, water, or earth and were carried by travelers across the Mediterranean. The find indicates a thriving local industry supplying religious souvenirs to pilgrims, linking the Judean Desert monasteries with broader Byzantine networks. Hyrcania, east of Jerusalem, originated as a Hasmonean fortress, later rebuilt by Herod the Great, and revived in the 5th century as a Christian monastery associated with Saint Sabas. The desert setting’s isolation complemented spiritual aims while remaining near major pilgrimage routes. The mold was found with other artifacts such as gold coins, a ring, inscribed fragments, and a reliquary lid, illustrating daily mo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/1-400-year-old-souvenir-mold-reveals-scale-of-byzantine-christian-pilgrimage-trade</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Imperialism and the Domino Theory: limitations of interventionist logic]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reviews how the so-called domino theory shaped Western foreign policy during the 1960s, especially around Vietnam. It explains that the fear of a regional cascade—popularized by Eisenhower's analogy of a row of dominoes—was a simplification of Cold War geopolitics. The piece argues that this line of thinking served to justify extensive U.S. military involvement in Indochina and the creation of strategic blocs around the world. It further contends that revolutions are less the result of linear contagion and more the outcome of complex, interdependent political systems. In contemporary terms, what was once described as a geopolitical inevitability is reframed as a precarious, fragile balance among states that depend on one another. The article concludes that imperial powers employed not only military force but also ideological justifications to maintain influence, with the metaphor of dominoes eventually appearing as an oversimplified explanation for global intervention.

La obra, realizada en tinta china sobre papel kraft, se encuentra en una fachada de la céntrica plaza de San Martín y representa a Iniesta acompañado de tres buitres, un guiño simbólico a uno de sus versos más recordados. El mural reproduce una línea de la canción 'Extremaydura', en la que el compositor canta sobre su peculiar vínculo con la figura del buitre carroñero, simbolizando su espíritu libre y su visión transgresora del arte y la vida. Tras el fallecimiento de Robe Iniesta el pasado 10 de diciembre de 2025, múltiples artistas y admiradores de toda España han mostrado su reconocimiento al músico placentino, figura clave del rock urbano y poeta de referencia.

Con un tono mordaz y sarcástico, la autora presenta una entrega ficticia de 'galardones' a distintos personajes públicos que, según ella, han destacado por su misoginia, machismo o complicidad con el patriarcado. Entre los premiados figuran políticos del Partido Popular, VOX y PSOE, así como figuras mediáticas. Por ejemplo, se critica al consejero madrileño Jorge Rodrigo por un comentario sexista hacia una diputada, a José María Sánchez de VOX por tratar a las mujeres con menos respeto, y a Alfonso Ussía por sus declaraciones despectivas hacia las víctimas de acoso.

En el mensaje, que coincide con la Navidad de 2025, Fran expresa su dolor y desilusión por el trato que, según él, el PP de Feijóo y del presidente valenciano Carlos Mazón ha dispensado a las familias afectadas por la tragedia. Tras perder a su padre Joaquín durante aquella catástrofe meteorológica, Fran denuncia que las víctimas han sido ignoradas y maltratadas institucionalmente durante más de un año. A lo largo de siete minutos, Cantos reprocha a Feijóo su falta de empatía y honestidad, sugiriendo que la defensa del dirigente popular a Mazón podría responder a ocultar errores o estrategias políticas durante la gestión de la crisis.

El recopilatorio, elaborado por Ramón López, asesor del PSOE en el Congreso, reúne distintos vídeos y publicaciones en redes sociales que muestran fallos, lapsus y declaraciones desafortunadas de figuras relevantes de la oposición. Entre ellos destaca el ya conocido error del líder popular Alberto Núñez Feijóo con su confuso 'Anotop At', convertido en meme en las redes, o las dificultades del presidente de Vox, Santiago Abascal, expresándose en francés durante un acto público. 

El tono del artículo combina crítica política y humor, reflejando el estilo característico de la sección *Tremending* del medio, que suele recoger y comentar episodios mediáticos de la actualidad política española.

La autora denuncia que viajar hoy no es tanto un acto de descubrimiento o aprendizaje como una forma de 'extractivismo emocional', en la que los viajeros se apropian simbólicamente de las vivencias y del alma de las ciudades que visitan. El turismo se describe como una industria que vende emociones enlatadas y autenticidad prefabricada, transformando los espacios urbanos en escenarios diseñados para el consumo y la fotografía. Martín analiza cómo ciudades como Barcelona, Madrid o Málaga han sido profundamente alteradas por la presión turística, la gentrificación y la especulación inmobiliaria.

Según el Grupo de Refugios de Gaza, más de 42.000 tiendas de campaña y refugios improvisados resultaron dañados, lo que impactó a unas 235.000 personas que ya sufrían condiciones extremas tras dos años de bombardeos y bloqueo israelí. La Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados Palestinos (UNRWA) destacó que, aunque la tormenta Byron fue un fenómeno natural, sus consecuencias se agravaron por la destrucción provocada por el ser humano.

Sin embargo, desde su estreno ha sido objeto de numerosas críticas que apuntan precisamente en sentido contrario, al considerar que el formato está dominado por tertulianos vinculados a la derecha mediática. La escritora y periodista Luz Sánchez-Mellado ironizó en X (antes Twitter) sobre la supuesta pluralidad del programa al enumerar a sus habituales colaboradores: Mariló Montero, Álvaro Nieto, Esteban Urreztieta y Elisa Beni, comentando en tono sarcástico que todos eran “sanchistas perdidos”.

El creador de contenido viajó al país centroamericano para mostrar las cárceles de máxima seguridad donde Bukele mantiene a los pandilleros y, además, entrevistar al mandatario. Su iniciativa ha provocado una ola de reacciones negativas en redes sociales, especialmente en la plataforma X (antes Twitter), donde numerosos usuarios le acusan de legitimar políticas autoritarias y de blanquear la imagen de un líder señalado por vulneraciones a los derechos humanos. Diversos tuiteros han recordado también las polémicas anteriores del streamer relacionadas con la especulación inmobiliaria y sus declaraciones sobre impuestos. Las críticas se centran en que TheGrefg, conocido por evitar implicarse en temas políticos, parece ahora alinearse con discursos cercanos a la ultraderecha.

Según la investigación, los agresores pertenecen a la banda juvenil de los Trinitarios y atacaron por error a un joven que no tenía vinculación alguna con grupos violentos. La víctima se encontraba con amigos cuando fue sorprendida por el grupo, que buscaba a miembros de la banda rival Dominican Don’t Play para realizar una 'caída', término usado para describir incursiones violentas en territorio enemigo con el fin de afirmar dominio o responder a agresiones anteriores. El ataque, ejecutado con machetes, dejó al joven gravemente herido, aunque logró sobrevivir. La Policía detuvo al día siguiente a los autores —un mayor de edad y dos menores— y los puso a disposición de la Fiscalía de Menores, que ordenó el ingreso de los adolescentes en un centro.

La acción principal consiste en un videomapping de ocho minutos proyectado sobre la fachada de la Casa de Correos, sede del Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid, que combina escenas icónicas de la serie con efectos especiales. Esta proyección, activa desde el 20 de diciembre y hasta final de año, se ha ejecutado sin que la plataforma haya pagado tasas ni a la Comunidad ni al Ayuntamiento, a pesar de hacer uso comercial de un edificio público emblemático. Lo más destacado de la estrategia llega en Nochevieja, ya que el cartel luminoso de “Feliz 2026” bajo el reloj de la Puerta del Sol utiliza la tipografía característica de 'Stranger Things', lo que garantiza visibilidad durante las retransmisiones de las campanadas tanto en RTVE como en Atresmedia.

Estos mensajes, difundidos públicamente, han generado una fuerte reacción social e institucional, especialmente por proceder de un agente en activo que pertenece a un cuerpo que debe representar la defensa de los derechos y la profesionalidad pública. Diversas asociaciones feministas y colectivos vinculados a la comunicación han condenado los hechos, pidiendo la apertura inmediata de una investigación interna.

Llevan casi una década viviendo allí y se dedican a la recolección de chatarra, pero el Ayuntamiento ha dictado un decreto que impide el estacionamiento de caravanas en suelos clasificados como agrícolas. La alcaldesa, Gwënola Franco, argumenta que el terreno no puede transformarse en una zona residencial por contravenir el Plan Local de Urbanismo Intercomunitario (PLUI), y que la norma se aplica a todos los ciudadanos por igual. Además, el consistorio denunció un supuesto 'desastre ambiental' causado por residuos metálicos y de petróleo en el terreno, aunque reconoció que ahora se encuentra casi limpio.

En un escrito firmado por la teniente fiscal del Supremo, María Ángeles Sánchez Conde, se denuncia que los magistrados de la Sala de lo Penal ignoraron sin justificación pruebas clave que demostraban que la información cuestionada ya era pública antes de que García Ortiz la recibiera. La fiscal destaca que varios periodistas afirmaron tener el correo con la confesión del empresario antes de que el fiscal general lo obtuviera, lo que, en su opinión, desvirtúa la acusación de filtración.

En el clip, el remero José Luis Korta irrumpe en Ajuria Enea a través de la ventana y mantiene un diálogo con Pradales mientras este ensaya su discurso de Nochevieja. A lo largo del vídeo, se introducen elementos cómicos como un retrato de una gitana llamado Angustias que, según los creadores, guarda parecido con la presidenta de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. El objetivo de la parodia es desdramatizar la actividad política y presentar una versión más cercana y desenfadada de la toma de decisiones, citando medidas como la ley de Vivienda y la alianza financiera vasca.

A diferencia de los evangelios canónicos (Mateo, Marcos, Lucas y Juan), estos textos llenan lagunas biográficas con relatos que varían entre lo devocional, lo literario y, en algunos casos, lo fantástico. Expertos como Thiago Maerki y André Leonardo Chevitarese señalan que, aunque no son sagrados, estos escritos cumplen como literatura que busca completar preguntas sobre la vida de Jesús y su familia. En ellos, Jesús aparece como un niño capaz de milagros y, en ciertas narrativas, como alguien vengativo o incluso violento, lo que contrasta con la imagen típica de la infancia del Mesías. María es presentada en contextos de virginidad y límites doctrinales sobre su embarazo, mientras que José figura como un anciano viudo que asume un papel masculino tradicional para afirmar la virginidad de María.

El incidente se produjo mientras Diaby estaba con su pareja, la influencer Nahikari Núñez, disfrutando de una consumición.

El actor expresó su indignación y tristeza ante lo ocurrido, recordando que es vasco, habla euskera y trabaja por la representación de la diversidad racial en Euskadi. Aun así, afirmó que lo verdaderamente grave es la discriminación implícita en asumir que una persona negra no puede estar en un bar sin estar vendiendo algo.

La acción buscaba llamar la atención de la Generalitat de Catalunya sobre el grave problema de la sobrepoblación de fauna cinegética, en especial de jabalíes, que afecta a las explotaciones agrícolas y ganaderas. Según denunciaron los manifestantes, las autoridades llevan tiempo sin actuar frente a un aumento preocupante de animales salvajes que causan daños en cultivos y ponen en riesgo la salud animal por la propagación de enfermedades como la peste porcina africana (PPA).

En ese contexto, un inspector jefe de la Policía Nacional, adscrito a la unidad Antidroga (Udyco), declaró como imputado por haber consultado en bases policiales los antecedentes de Pablo Iglesias cuando era líder de la formación. El agente justificó su actuación alegando que formaba parte de una investigación sobre Miguel Urbán, cofundador de Podemos, acusado falsamente de participar en una supuesta operación de narcotráfico destinada a financiar al partido.

Durante el interrogatorio, el fiscal Vicente González Mota cuestionó la normalidad de esa práctica y planteó una comparación clave: si, en investigaciones similares como el caso Gürtel, se había consultado también la ficha policial del entonces presidente del Gobierno, Mariano Rajoy.

Diversos colectivos profesionales y ciudadanos denuncian que esta medida forma parte de una estrategia continuada de debilitamiento progresivo de la sanidad pública para justificar su externalización. Según estos grupos, la región padece recortes en personal y recursos, largas listas de espera y una saturación que afecta directamente a la calidad asistencial. 

El artículo destaca que Quirón y Ribera Salud no son simples proveedoras, sino grandes corporaciones con intereses económicos en la expansión del sector sanitario privado.

La investigación se centra en las actividades económicas de González Amador a través de sus empresas Maxwell Cremona y Masterman, que habrían obtenido beneficios millonarios mediante contratos de venta de material sanitario y supuestas irregularidades fiscales.

El texto analiza cómo su estilo personal y su discurso se han convertido en un fenómeno mediático que trasciende la política regional para convertirla en un símbolo dentro del panorama nacional. Desde la perspectiva del autor, Ayuso encarna una forma moderna de populismo conservador que apela más a las emociones y a la identidad que a los argumentos racionales o a la gestión institucional. Se comentan además las reacciones polarizadas que genera entre partidarios y detractores, que la ven, respectivamente, como una líder valiente o como una figura divisiva.

El gesto, aunque chocante, tiene una doble intención: por un lado, denunciar la dejadez de los dueños de mascotas que no recogen los excrementos y, por otro, expresar una crítica simbólica hacia el conflicto en Gaza, según interpretan algunos residentes. Las imágenes, que podrían confundirse con montajes de inteligencia artificial por lo inusual de la escena, se han extendido rápidamente entre los vecinos.

Estas alucinaciones, caracterizadas por la visión de diminutas personas moviéndose y actuando en el entorno real, han sido documentadas en diversas regiones del mundo, como Papúa Nueva Guinea, China y Filipinas. En China, el hongo es conocido localmente como 'Jian shou qing' y se considera un alimento apreciado, aunque cuando se consume poco cocinado puede desencadenar vívidas visiones descritas como 'xiao ren ren' o 'pequeños hombres'.

A pesar de su efecto, los análisis químicos y genómicos realizados hasta la fecha no han revelado la presencia de ningún compuesto psicoactivo conocido, lo que sugiere que el hongo podría contener una sustancia completamente nueva responsable de estos efectos.

El texto, característico del Día de los Santos Inocentes, describe cómo el nuevo diseño, denominado 'Tartán Operativo', sustituiría el clásico verde del uniforme por un estampado de cuadros en tonos verde bosque y gris marengo. Según la pieza, este patrón se basa en un estudio de 'psicología cromática inversa' que tendría como propósito confundir al delincuente mediante ilusiones ópticas. Además, se añade que los cuadros ayudarían a disimular manchas frecuentes, reduciendo los costes de limpieza. En tono humorístico, la noticia menciona un supuesto 'efecto hipnótico' y la posibilidad de incorporar una gaita reglamentaria para las unidades de Tráfico, en alusión a un toque escocés.

Ambientada en un valle cántabro, la novela refleja cómo el tiempo y el clima condicionan la vida de los personajes y sus viajes, especialmente desde la mirada del joven Daniel, el Mochuelo. Se exploran referencias a Molledo y su entorno, así como las vivencias del autor relacionadas con veranos más fríos en el pasado y la evolución climática observada a lo largo de las décadas. El texto también ofrece datos históricos sobre precipitaciones y temperatura en la región de Iguña, Cantabria, y contextualiza el clima oceánico (Köppen Cfb) de la zona. Además, se mencionan lluvias históricas que influyeron en la manuscripción original y en la ambientación de la novela, conectando la literatura con la meteorología y el cambio climático.

La norma regula el consumo y la promoción de alcohol, bebidas energéticas, tabaco, vapeadores y cannabis, y ha generado una fuerte polémica por su marcado carácter punitivo y la escasa concreción de las medidas preventivas.

La ley establece un régimen sancionador dividido en infracciones leves, graves y muy graves, con multas que van desde los 200 euros hasta más de 600.000. Entre las conductas sancionadas como graves figura la promoción del cannabis en medios accesibles a menores, la asociación de su consumo con supuestos efectos terapéuticos o estimulantes, y el regalo o venta de cualquier tipo de merchandising con símbolos identificativos de esta sustancia, independientemente de la edad del destinatario.

Abdullah al Fandi, un joven agricultor de 27 años, ha creado en las afueras de Trípoli un sistema que combina la cría de peces con el cultivo de hortalizas sin tierra, logrando producir lechuga, menta, albahaca y repollo mediante un circuito cerrado que reutiliza los desechos de los peces como fertilizante natural. Gracias a una subvención de 20.000 euros del programa de apoyo a startups financiado por la Unión Europea, su proyecto ‘HydroHarvest’ busca optimizar el uso del agua y fomentar una agricultura orgánica y sostenible. Expertos como Saleh Shaqan destacan que la acuaponía puede ser una herramienta clave para mitigar los efectos del cambio climático en un país donde el 95 % del territorio es desértico y las precipitaciones anuales apenas superan los 56 mililitros.

La falta de esta mano de obra, caracterizada por una alta exigencia física, se hace cada vez más visible en tareas que aún no pueden ser sustituidas por la tecnología o la automatización.

El origen del conflicto se encuentra en un talonario de participaciones que la Comisión de Fiestas no entregó a tiempo a la administración de lotería, lo que provocó que muchas papeletas vendidas no tuvieran respaldo real en décimos. Este fallo, reconocido por la propia Comisión, ha dividido al pueblo y generado fuertes desacuerdos entre los vecinos. Durante una larga reunión celebrada en el Hogar del Pensionista, se alcanzó un acuerdo verbal: la Comisión renunciaría a sus premios y los demás agraciados aceptarían una reducción en sus ganancias para compensar el desfase. Sin embargo, la falta de un documento firmado y la existencia de tres décimos ya cobrados por algunos miembros de la Comisión han incrementado la desconfianza.

Entrevistando a más de 75 empleados, los inspectores indicaron que las reacciones de la alta dirección ante los trabajadores que levantaban preocupaciones de seguridad podían percibirse como represalias, lo que llevó a que muchos informes anónimos no se presentaran y se canalizaran a través de representantes sindicales. Este ambiente de “receptividad a la producción” se suma a fallos mecánicos no corregidos durante años y a una tendencia de recortes de personal que, según analistas, debilita la cultura de seguridad. Paralelamente, la compañía enfrenta una de las mayores solicitudes de incremento de tarifas de la historia para cubrir inversiones en la red eléctrica, lo que añade presión pública y regulatoria.

En su análisis, Juliana destaca que los casos de corrupción que afectan al PSOE, junto a nuevas acusaciones por abusos sexuales contra algunos de sus dirigentes, están provocando un fuerte desgaste en la credibilidad del Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. A pesar de ello, el presidente parece decidido a resistir hasta el final de la legislatura, prevista para 2027.

Juliana subraya que la sociedad necesita conocer la magnitud real de estos escándalos y las posibles responsabilidades derivadas.

A raíz de los resultados, el partido ha pasado de presentar pactos con la extrema derecha como una excepción a tratarlos como una parte habitual del tablero político. Este giro implica abandonar exigencias previas como pedir abstención del PSOE para evitar apoyar a Vox y abrir la puerta a un entendimiento que no descarte la entrada de Vox en el Gobierno. Aunque Feijóo había prometido no gobernar con Vox a nivel nacional, la autoría de este cambio se atribuye a la necesidad de responder a un contexto en el que Vox crece y la izquierda ya no utiliza el miedo a la extrema derecha como motor electoral como antes.

Además, más de 171.000 personas han resultado heridas y miles siguen desaparecidas bajo los escombros, lo que sugiere que la cifra real de víctimas podría ser aún mayor. La ONU calcula que la reconstrucción de Gaza requerirá unos 70.000 millones de dólares, reflejando así la magnitud de la destrucción material y humana. Barrios enteros han quedado reducidos a ruinas y casi toda la población ha sido desplazada, enfrentando una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes. 

El alto el fuego instaurado el 10 de octubre no se ha traducido en una pausa efectiva de la violencia, dado que al menos 411 palestinos han muerto desde su entrada en vigor.

En lugar de intentar robar contraseñas directamente, los atacantes aprovechan flujos de autenticación legítimos mediante OAuth y utilizan enlaces, botones y códigos QR que llevan a páginas que simulan ser de Microsoft. El proceso típico comienza con un correo o código QR que redirige a una página controlada por el atacante, donde la víctima recibe un código de dispositivo usado como si fuera una verificación de seguridad. Al introducir ese código en una URL de Microsoft, la víctima concede permisos de acceso a su cuenta sin saberlo, permitiendo al atacante leer correos, acceder a documentos y moverse lateralmente dentro de una red. Proofpoint advierte que esta técnica representa una adaptación del phishing hacia flujos de autenticación confiables.

Tras alistarse en el ejército ruso en 1772, participa en las guerras ruso-otomanas y mantiene relaciones destacadas con figuras como John Paul Jones y Suvorov. Ribas desempeña un papel decisivo en la conquista de Crimea y en la construcción de la nueva base naval de Sebastopol, además de liderar la captura de Izmail en 1791, una victoria que se celebra en Rusia y que impulsa el impulso para crear Odessa.

Durante un episodio en el que participó el comediante Shane Gillis, Rogan leyó fragmentos del texto de las placas y mostró sorpresa al leer la del presidente Biden, que lo describe como “el peor presidente de la historia estadounidense” y enumera controversias como la retirada de Afganistán.

Según José Luis Ruiz Espejo, secretario de Servicios Sociales, la medida representa un bloqueo sistemático y una gestión deficiente que agrava la pobreza infantil en la región. El portavoz socialista critica que 23 millones estén bloqueados para 2025 y otros 23 millones para 2026, mientras que Europa ha flexibilizado la cofinanciación. Se destaca que el objetivo de las Tarjetas Monedero es cubrir necesidades básicas como alimentos y suministros para las personas más desfavorecidas, especialmente menores, y promover la inclusión social sin estigmatización.

Nacida en París en 1934, Bardot comenzó su carrera como modelo y rápidamente se convirtió en un fenómeno mundial tras su papel en 'Y Dios creó a la mujer' (1956), dirigido por Roger Vadim, su primer marido. Conocida por sus iniciales 'BB', marcó una época con su estilo y magnetismo, convirtiéndose en icono de la moda y referente de emancipación femenina. Durante los años 50 y 60 protagonizó películas célebres como 'La Vérité' y 'Le Mépris', colaborando con directores como Henri-Georges Clouzot y Jean-Luc Godard. A comienzos de los 70, Bardot se retiró del cine a los 39 años para dedicarse a su verdadera pasión: la defensa de los animales. En 1977 inició su lucha contra la caza de focas, fundando años después la Fundación Brigitte-Bardot, dedicada a la protección animal. Con el tiempo, su figura también estuvo marcada por polémicas declaraciones]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-brigitte-bardot-icono-del-cine-frances-y-defensora-de-los-animales-a-los-91-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-brigitte-bardot-icono-del-cine-frances-y-defensora-de-los-animales-a-los-91-anos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Principales figuras controvertidas del actual Gobierno de Trump según Ron Filipkowski]]></title><description><![CDATA[El periodista y analista político Ron Filipkowski ha publicado en Meidas+ una lista titulada “25 Worst Villains of the Trump Admin”, en la que clasifica a los veinticinco altos cargos más dañinos o controvertidos del actual Gobierno de Donald Trump.

Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, presidente de la Comisión de la UA, alertó de que tal reconocimiento podría crear un precedente peligroso para la estabilidad del continente. El Gobierno de Somalia calificó la medida de Israel como un acto ilegal y una agresión a su soberanía, advirtiendo que solo aumentará las tensiones políticas y de seguridad en la región. China también expresó su apoyo a la integridad territorial de Somalia mediante una conversación entre su embajador y el ministro somalí de Asuntos Exteriores, reafirmando su oposición al secesionismo.

El artículo describe posibles indicios y considera el contexto legal y político en el que se mueven estas decisiones, destacando la importancia de la independencia de las instituciones judiciales y la supervisión mediática en procesos de indulto.

La autora compara esta forma de violencia aplazada con situaciones en Europa, donde personas en prisión preventiva o acusadas de delitos no violentos sufren un desgaste prolongado a través de un sistema legal que administra la espera como castigo. La violencia no necesita ser espectacular para existir; puede manifestarse a través del abandono, la suspensión de derechos y la vulnerabilidad sostenida. Esta forma de violencia permite a los Estados y al orden internacional mantener la apariencia de normalidad y respeto a los derechos humanos mientras se ignoran las consecuencias reales de sus políticas.

Además, instó a que se publiquen todos los nombres implicados en los documentos y se haga rendir cuentas a los responsables. 

Epstein, implicado en una red de abuso y prostitución de menores, se suicidó en prisión en 2019 mientras esperaba juicio.

Portugal destaca por ser el país menos asequible, donde prácticamente un salario completo se destina a un apartamento de este tipo, mientras que en Berna, Suiza, el coste representa solo el 24% del salario medio, siendo la ciudad más favorable. Otras regiones como Europa del Este, Sudeste y del Sur presentan ratios altos de alquiler respecto al salario, superando el 50%, lo que sitúa a las personas solteras en una situación económica más desfavorable al no poder compartir gastos.

Sin embargo, tras más de una década, el proyecto se considera un fracaso generalizado. El principal objetivo de la concesión —reducir las pérdidas de agua del 55% al 30%— no se ha cumplido, y actualmente la cifra asciende al 56%. El Consorcio Insular de Aguas estudia la rescisión del contrato o su cesión a una nueva empresa, y la propia Canal Isabel II ha mostrado su disposición a abandonar la isla anticipadamente. 

El análisis técnico del Consorcio revela que Canal Gestión solo ha ejecutado 32,6 de los 54 millones de euros comprometidos en inversiones, un 40% menos de lo previsto.

Además, Mazón mintió en la comisión del Congreso al afirmar que nadie sabía de los ahogados hasta la madrugada siguiente.

El hallazgo supone un acontecimiento relevante para la conservación de la biodiversidad en el sudeste asiático y aporta nuevas esperanzas para la protección de especies amenazadas. Según los datos difundidos, la confirmación de la presencia de este felino se logró gracias a trabajos de campo recientes, que incluyeron el uso de cámaras trampa y la colaboración de expertos locales e internacionales en fauna salvaje.

El animal, descrito como muy esquivo y difícil de observar, habita zonas boscosas y poco accesibles, lo que ha contribuido a la escasez de avistamientos durante décadas. La falta de registros fiables había llevado a muchos científicos a temer su desaparición local, principalmente debido a la deforestación, la pérdida de hábitat y la presión humana sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

La película combina impresionantes avances en captura de movimiento y CGI con una narrativa que da voz a los indígenas y a la naturaleza, en contraposición a la perspectiva invasora y belicista de los humanos. Cameron utiliza la saga para criticar de forma contundente a nuestra especie y sus actitudes colonizadoras, estableciendo un paralelismo histórico con los pueblos indígenas y los errores del western clásico estadounidense. Además, reescribe los códigos del cine de aventuras y del western para ofrecer un enfoque interno ('emic'), desde la visión de los Na’vi, sus clanes y su mitología, mostrando respeto por el entorno y la cultura.

El arresto se produjo en una nave alejada del núcleo urbano, donde el prófugo se encontraba oculto. La operación fue posible gracias a la labor de la Sección de Localización de Fugitivos y a la colaboración ciudadana tras incluir su perfil en la lista de los diez delincuentes más buscados de España. Los hechos por los que Pavón fue condenado incluyen el hallazgo de dos cuerpos en un pozo: una de las víctimas falleció por un disparo de escopeta en el pecho y la otra a causa de múltiples lesiones con un objeto contundente. La detención se realizó tras detectar un vehículo con un ocupante con rasgos físicos similares a los del buscado, confirmando los agentes su identidad y procediendo a su arresto inmediato.

El buque transportaba unos cuatro millones de litros de combustible y fue detenido junto con sus 16 tripulantes, cuyas nacionalidades y el pabellón del barco no se han revelado. Este incidente se suma a una serie de detenciones similares ocurridas en los últimos años en la misma zona, una de las rutas más críticas para el transporte mundial de crudo, ya que por allí pasa aproximadamente una quinta parte del petróleo que se comercia globalmente. Irán sostiene que las incautaciones están relacionadas con su lucha contra el tráfico ilícito de combustible, pero muchos observadores lo interpretan como una herramienta de presión en el contexto de crecientes tensiones con Estados Unidos e Israel.

Estas piezas estaban decoradas con cruces y llevaban inscripciones en griego que decían “Bendición del Señor desde los lugares sagrados”, y servían para transportar aceite, agua o tierra de sitios considerados santos. El hallazgo refleja la importancia de la industria de souvenirs religiosos en la época bizantina y la extensión de los viajes de peregrinos desde Jerusalén hasta otros puntos del Mediterráneo. Hyrcania, originalmente una fortaleza fundada durante la dinastía asmonea y reconstruida por Herodes el Grande, se convirtió en el siglo V en un monasterio cristiano vinculado a San Sabas.

Estas declaraciones se produjeron durante su tradicional maratón televisivo de final de año, un evento de varias horas en el que respondió a preguntas de ciudadanos y periodistas rusos y extranjeros. En respuesta a una pregunta del corresponsal de la BBC, Putin negó que Rusia tenga planes de atacar a otros países europeos y calificó de infundadas esas advertencias, aunque reiteró que Moscú está preparada para defenderse si se siente amenazada.

Putin volvió a culpar a la OTAN de haber incumplido supuestas promesas realizadas tras el final de la Guerra Fría sobre no expandirse hacia el este, argumento que utiliza de forma recurrente para justificar la invasión de Ucrania iniciada en febrero de 2022.

El acuerdo entre IU y Sumar se produce tras días de intensas negociaciones y contactos con Chunta Aragonesista (CHA), que finalmente concurrirá también en solitario. La coalición IU-Sumar busca reforzar un proyecto político de izquierdas centrado en los derechos sociales y laborales, el acceso a la vivienda, los servicios públicos y la defensa del territorio. Tanto IU como Sumar destacan la importancia de la cooperación entre fuerzas progresistas para mejorar la vida de la ciudadanía, aunque aún no han concretado detalles sobre las listas o el programa electoral.

El incremento, que oscila entre 60 y 360 euros mensuales para la mayoría de la plantilla, y entre 240 y 360 euros para ingenieros de I+D, se enmarca en un contexto de intensa competencia en el sector automotriz chino, con numerosas marcas luchando por cuota de mercado y precios. El grupo atribuye la medida a la necesidad de mantener la innovación y evitar la fuga de talento hacia competidores, especialmente ante la presión de un mercado saturado donde los márgenes son estrechos y algunas compañías ya han cerrado. Aunque el incremento medio podría parecer modesto, el impacto financiero es significativo: calculado con un gasto anual adicional que alcanza miles de millones de euros, especialmente si se considera el tamaño de la plantilla.

Los detenidos serían alojados en siete almacenes de gran tamaño, con capacidad para entre 5.000 y 10.000 personas, y 16 almacenes más pequeños de hasta 1.500 personas. Estas instalaciones estarían situadas cerca de importantes centros logísticos en Virginia, Texas, Luisiana, Arizona, Georgia y Misuri. Actualmente, Estados Unidos ya posee el sistema de detención de inmigrantes más grande del mundo, y se estima que casi la mitad de los detenidos no tienen cargos criminales pendientes ni condenas previas.

La autora critica el empeño de algunos sectores, particularmente del Partido Popular, en demonizar esa frase, sugiriendo que se trata de un debate más cultural que religioso. García Aller recuerda que estas expresiones conviven en sociedades plurales y que no excluyen la libertad de expresión ni la convivencia. A lo largo de su reflexión, la periodista sitúa el tema en un contexto más amplio: la Navidad como periodo de celebración, ayuda a los necesitados y reflexión comunitaria. Señala que el cristianismo, y otros enfoques, deben coexistir sin que la lingüística de las festividades llegue a convertirse en una barrera para la inclusión. En días cercanos a la Navidad, se ofrecen ejemplos de actos solidarios, como el de Badalona, donde vecinos protestaron contra el alojamiento de personas en situación de calle, lo que la a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-navidad-y-la-libertad-de-expresion-frente-al-uso-de-expresiones-festivas-en-la-politica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-navidad-y-la-libertad-de-expresion-frente-al-uso-de-expresiones-festivas-en-la-politica</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 17:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uso de fondos públicos para el mantenimiento de inmuebles de la Iglesia Católica con superávit]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia denuncia la concesión de subvenciones públicas por parte de la Conselleria de Educación y Cultura y la Diputación de Valencia a la Iglesia Católica para la reparación de edificios parroquiales, sumando un total de 3 millones de euros entre 2024 y 2025. Estos fondos se destinan a trabajos de mantenimiento como reparación de fachadas, tejados, pintura y azulejos, a pesar de que las diócesis españolas reportaron un superávit de más de 133 millones de euros el año pasado. El artículo compara esta situación con un ejemplo hipotético de un particular que posee múltiples viviendas construidas con dinero público y que recibe financiación del Estado para repararlas a pesar de contar con fondos propios.

Su compañero, presente durante los hechos, no informó a sus superiores y permitió que el incidente no tuviera consecuencias inmediatas. Las cámaras de seguridad del puerto captaron toda la secuencia, incluyendo la interacción entre los agentes y el altercado con el personal del local. Como resultado, el agente agresor recibió una suspensión de siete días, mientras que el que encubrió los hechos fue sancionado con cinco días.

Añade que muchos creyentes, incluidos sus propios abuelos, empleaban ambas expresiones indistintamente.

Inicialmente, el Consejo de Gobierno reconoció una indemnización de 850.000 euros a cada afectada. Una de las víctimas recurrió, solicitando más de tres millones de euros por el daño moral sufrido durante los años sin convivir con su familia biológica y al conocer la equivocación. La Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo coincidió con la administración en la necesidad de indemnizar, pero elevó la cuantía a 975.000 euros por dos circunstancias adicionales: la fallecimiento de la madre biológica antes de que la joven conociera su verdadera filiación, impidiendo restablecer el ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tsj-de-la-rioja-eleva-a-975-000-euros-la-indemnizacion-por-dano-moral-a-una-joven-intercambiada-al-nacer</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tsj-de-la-rioja-eleva-a-975-000-euros-la-indemnizacion-por-dano-moral-a-una-joven-intercambiada-al-nacer</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflexión crítica sobre la asignación de prioridades divinas en los milagros]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo aborda de forma irónica y crítica la manera en que ciertos fenómenos milagrosos parecen priorizar trivialidades por encima de problemas graves, como la salud infantil.

Se cuestiona la coherencia de atribuir responsabilidad a los seres humanos cuando, si existiera un dios creador, éste sería el responsable de la desigualdad y las desgracias en el mundo. La entrada destaca la incongruencia de que milagros menores ocurran mientras persisten problemas graves como el cáncer infantil, y señala que la sociedad actual, con sus desigualdades, amplifica estas injusticias.

Este modelo es equivalente a un Audi A6 e-tron europeo en tamaño y prestaciones, pero con potencia similar a la del Audi e-tron GT, aunque con un coste comparable al de un Audi A3 en España. La diferencia de precios se explica por varios factores: se trata de una marca china, con plataforma y componentes de SAIC, producción local subvencionada por el gobierno, y mano de obra más económica. La estrategia del mercado chino, con fuerte competencia y control de la cadena de valor de vehículos eléctricos, permite ofrecer coches muy potentes a precios muy bajos. En contraste, en Europa, los modelos equivalentes de Audi superan ampliamente los 60.000 euros, incluso en versiones de acceso.
