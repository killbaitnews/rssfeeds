The launch, conducted via the Long March CZ-2F/Y Y22 rocket from Jiuquan Space Center, represents China's 75th orbital launch of 2025. Shenzhou 22 followed a fast two-orbit rendezvous profile, docking with the Tianhe module of the Chinese Space Station just under four hours after liftoff. The spacecraft carries 600 kg of supplies for the three astronauts aboard Shenzhou 21 and ensures a safe return vehicle in case of emergencies. The decision to launch Shenzhou 22 followed the discovery of triangular cracks in the outermost layer of Shenzhou 20's window during pre-return inspections. Simulations indicated a high risk that these cracks could expand during reentry, compromising the capsule's pressurization despite backup safety layers.

Contrary to common perceptions, most Chinese lending is directed toward high-income countries rather than developing nations. The United States has been the largest recipient, receiving over $200 billion, which has funded cash flow for major companies including Amazon, Tesla, Ford, Boeing, and Disney. Chinese loans also support critical infrastructure projects such as LNG facilities in Texas and Louisiana, data centers in Virginia, and major airports in Los Angeles and New York. European countries have also benefited, with Germany and the UK being major recipients. In Portugal, Chinese investment has grown substantially, particularly in the energy sector, including ownership stakes in the national transmission operator, EDP.

They began a coordinated hunger strike on 2 November 2025 to protest their prolonged pre-trial detention and the UK government's handling of arms production linked to the conflict in Gaza. Four of them were involved in a 2024 break-in at an Elbit Systems factory in Filton, where they damaged property and spray-painted equipment as part of an anti-arms-trade protest. The two others were arrested during a 2025 action at RAF Brize Norton. None face terrorism charges, but the article argues that they are being held under counter-terrorism powers following the government’s proscription of Palestine Action.

The amendment passed with 199 votes in favor and 135 against and was presented during the parliamentary discussion of the upcoming year's social security budget. The initiative reignited longstanding debate over workplace productivity, wealth creation, and exploitation. Supporters of the amendment, such as Senator Olivier Henno, argued the change would support economic recovery with minimal impact on workers—translating to just one additional hour per month. Henno also claimed the measure would save over 10 billion euros per year. However, the proposal has met substantial resistance from opposition lawmakers, labor advocates, and even members of the government. Critics voiced concern over increasing workloads for workers in strenuous jobs and rejected characterizations of the change as 'imperceptible.'

Unlike hard drives that store data magnetically, SSDs store information by modifying electrical charges in NAND flash cells. This data can degrade over time if the drive is left unpowered. Consumer-grade SSDs, which typically use QLC or TLC NAND, can lose data after 1 to 3 years without power, while higher-end MLC and SLC NAND can last longer. Temperature, NAND quality, and voltage loss are factors that affect data retention. Despite this, most users do not need to worry, as primary SSDs in active use rarely sit unpowered for extended periods. However, for long-term storage or archival purposes, relying solely on SSDs is risky. Experts recommend maintaining backups using multiple storage methods, following the 3-2-1 rule: three copies of data on at least two different media, with one copy off-site. Ultimately, while SS]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-unpowered-ssds-may-lose-data-over-time-and-how-to-protect-it</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-unpowered-ssds-may-lose-data-over-time-and-how-to-protect-it</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ancient and Historic Engineering Innovations Around the World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article showcases remarkable engineering achievements from ancient and historic civilizations, emphasizing how ingenuity and practical problem-solving allowed people to create enduring infrastructure.

A report from Le Parisien claims that the OS has increasingly drawn the attention of judicial police, who argue that its security features obstruct criminal investigations. The controversy highlights a case involving a 27-year-old suspect linked to drug trafficking who allegedly used a Pixel device running GrapheneOS. When investigators attempted to access the seized phone, it reportedly reset itself, erasing potential evidence. Police sources described the software as a tool that criminals use to hide transactions and communications, and even alleged that it includes a “fake Snapchat” interface—an assertion the GrapheneOS team firmly denies.

The deaths are attributed to torture, lack of medical care, and food deprivation. Most of the detainees were from Gaza, and less than a third were classified as combatants by the Israeli army, indicating that many civilians were among the fatalities. Internal Israeli military data suggest that civilians accounted for approximately 83% of deaths in Gaza, with three-quarters of detainees being non-combatants. Cases of extreme abuse, including physical violence and sexual assault, were reported, yet only one Israeli soldier has been convicted, and other cases remain largely uninvestigated. Notable facilities with high mortality include Sde Teiman, Ketziot, Ofer, Nitzan, Megiddo, and others.

However, tensions are emerging, particularly between Germany, France, and Poland. Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has been outspoken about the threat of war with Russia, predicting a possible attack on NATO territory as early as 2029. Meanwhile, Poland echoes similar warnings, claiming that intelligence from EU and Ukrainian sources suggests that Russia may be preparing for a large-scale war within the next few years. France's military leaders have also joined the chorus, suggesting that the French army must be prepared for conflict in the near future. Despite these shared concerns, underlying political and military ambitions are becoming more apparent. Germany’s increased military presence and its aspirations to become the dominant military power in Europe have caused unease among its EU partners, particularly]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/growing-tensions-within-the-eu-the-role-of-anti-russian-rhetoric</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/growing-tensions-within-the-eu-the-role-of-anti-russian-rhetoric</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 01:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical Influence of Russian Jewish Immigrants on Israeli Military and Political Culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines the historical influence of Russian Jewish immigrants on the political, military, and intelligence culture of Israel. It notes that nearly all Israeli prime ministers have Russian roots, reflecting a broader Russian imprint on the country’s leadership and national identity. The author traces the origins of this influence to the Russian Empire, where Jews faced systemic restrictions, violence, and limited opportunities for social integration. These conditions fostered radical nationalist and self-defense movements among Russian Jews, which later shaped the Zionist movement in Palestine. The text details how many of the early armed organizations in Palestine, including Bar Giora, Hashomer, Haganah, and Irgun, were founded by Russian immigrants, and how key figures in Israel’s intelligence services, such as Mossad and Shin Bet directors, also have Russian heritage.

The plan aims to address Russia's demands, particularly in the Donbass region, and calls for Ukraine's demilitarization. It has created tensions between the United States and the European Union, with the EU's policies focused on prolonging the war to sustain its arms industry. The article also outlines how the EU's support for the war could be undermined by the peace plan, which reflects a broader shift in US interests, especially given the economic strain of supporting Ukraine's defense. Trump's approach seems to align with corporate interests in military and strategic sectors, including energy and agricultural investments in Ukraine.

Local folklore has long viewed Barhout as a prison for djinn, but much of the notoriety stems from a Hadith attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, which mentions the site in connection with vile waters, though the historical accuracy of this claim is uncertain. The first confirmed descent to the bottom occurred in 2021 by an Omani speleological team after multiple attempts, revealing a subterranean ecosystem that includes snakes, frogs, lizards, birds, and beetles thriving in the cave’s microclimate.

Hurwitz expresses concern that the Holocaust education used to counter antisemitism is no longer effective in this new media landscape. The piece argues that the dominant narrative of Israel's righteousness is rapidly unraveling as people see the violence in Gaza in real time. The article further criticizes the simplistic framing of Zionism and Israel as a 'family' in an attempt to emotionally manipulate audiences, while highlighting the tension between global perspectives and Israeli actions.

This revelation came to light after podcaster Matt Binder shared screenshots of various accounts, such as 'Charlie's Voice Rising' (based in Eastern Europe) and 'Defiant Ls' (from Japan). Another account, 'Americaman,' was traced to Indonesia. The exposure has sparked significant backlash, especially as some of these influencers have large followings, including 'Defiant Ls,' which has 1.6 million followers. Even former President Donald Trump was involved when he shared a post from a MAGA account based in South Asia, drawing criticism from those who are questioning the authenticity and origins of the MAGA movement's social media presence.

FBS, founded by Emilee Saldaya, advocates for 'freebirthing,' a practice where mothers give birth without medical assistance, rejecting even midwives and doctors. The society's podcast, online courses, and social media have gained massive followings, offering women a promise of 'natural' birth experiences. However, real-life tragedies have followed, with some babies suffering brain damage or even death due to complications like shoulder dystocia, which require medical intervention. Influencers like Saldaya downplay risks and promote radical responsibility, encouraging women to avoid medical help even in dangerous situations. The investigation highlights how the society's teachings led to preventable injuries and deaths, particularly in the US, where healthcare disparities push some women away from professional birth care. Critics argue that F]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/free-birth-society-s-influence-linked-to-tragic-baby-deaths</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/free-birth-society-s-influence-linked-to-tragic-baby-deaths</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Axon’s Vision for the Future of Public Safety in Mexico: A Technological Shift in Policing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Axon is revolutionizing public safety by creating a connected ecosystem that integrates digital evidence management, artificial intelligence, and non-lethal solutions like the TASER 10.

Over the last 25 years, these banks have provided around $200 billion in loans to American businesses, many of which were kept secret by using shell companies based in offshore locations like the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and Delaware. A significant portion of this lending has been used by Chinese companies to acquire stakes in crucial US industries, especially those in national security and high-tech sectors, such as robotics, biotechnology, and semiconductors. This hidden financial network, which spans across many developed nations, including US allies like the UK and Germany, is part of China’s broader strategy to secure critical technologies. Despite growing concerns, the US has struggled to fully track the extent of these hidden loans due to the complex and opaque nature of China’s financing methods, includ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-us-the-largest-recipient-of-chinese-bank-loans-despite-warnings-against-them</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-us-the-largest-recipient-of-chinese-bank-loans-despite-warnings-against-them</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dutch Military Fires on Unidentified Drones over Volkel Air Base Amid Rising Drone Incidents]]></title><description><![CDATA[On Friday night, the Dutch military fired at unidentified drones spotted over Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands, according to the Ministry of Defense and the Koninklijke Marechaussee (Dutch military police). The incident took place between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., with ground-based weapons used in an attempt to bring down the drones. However, the drones left the area and were not recovered. This event is one of several recent drone sightings near sensitive locations in the region, including the port area of Terneuzen, NATO command center in Brunssum, Maastricht Aachen Airport, and Schiphol. Similar drone incidents have also been reported in Germany and Belgium. Drone use is banned over airports and military bases in the Netherlands for security and flight safety reasons.

Israeli tanks entered the area, trapping dozens of families in Gaza's eastern neighborhoods, particularly around Al Shaaf, Al Nazzaz, and Bagdad streets. The military then installed concrete barriers, pushing the boundary further into Gaza. This action is seen as an expansion of Israeli-controlled territory, aligning with the Trump administration's ceasefire plan. Many families caught in the area remain unaccounted for, while heavy bombing struck the region during and after the shift. Local sources report that the situation is growing increasingly dangerous. The Palestinian government press office condemned this as a grave violation of the ceasefire, citing over 400 breaches since it began.

The plan emphasizes a central role for the United States, which would oversee the rebuilding process and benefit from a significant share of the profits. This includes the establishment of a dedicated investment fund financed by seized Russian assets, potentially amounting to 100 billion euros. The plan focuses on infrastructure, housing, and industrial recovery, with priority given to U.S. companies that could earn up to 50% of the profits. This approach seeks to build a lasting economic relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. beyond the current military aid. The plan also suggests major territorial concessions by Ukraine and promises that the country will not join NATO.

The mission’s initial cost is projected to exceed £100 million. However, recent developments suggest a shift in international dynamics. The United States has presented a peace agreement draft with Russia, which includes significant territorial concessions and restrictions on foreign military presence in Ukraine.

On November 7, an opposition lawmaker in Japan pressed Takaichi on what actions in the Taiwan Strait would justify military intervention by Japan. Her response signaled a stronger stance on security, particularly regarding a possible crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing swiftly responded on November 16, warning Japan of severe consequences if it intervenes militarily in the Taiwan Strait.

Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed that the signs, which warned against unauthorized access, were removed by the Mexican Navy, as the location appeared to be within Mexican territory. The Pentagon later explained that contractors had mistakenly marked a restricted area near the Rio Grande due to shifting water depths that altered the perceived location of the international border.

Ukraine is to remain non-aligned with NATO, and its military will be capped at 600,000 personnel. In exchange, Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees. The plan also suggests economic incentives, including the establishment of a Ukrainian Development Fund, investments in high-growth industries, and the reconstruction of war-torn areas. Moreover, it proposes the gradual lifting of sanctions on Russia and invites the country to rejoin the global economy, including the G8. An international economic package will be established for Ukraine’s recovery, with substantial contributions from the U.S. and Europe.

Although ICE claims its operations target illegal immigrants with criminal histories, reports indicate that Native individuals, including members of the Navajo and Mescalero tribes, have been detained due to assumptions made about their ethnicity and appearance. Many ICE officers are reportedly unaware of the unique status of Native Americans as U.S. citizens. In response, Native tribes are urging the Trump Administration to direct ICE to accept Tribal IDs as proof of citizenship, especially for those who may lack other documentation such as birth certificates.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, emphasized that any successful peace plan must be supported by both Ukraine and Europe, warning that rewarding aggression would lead to further Russian expansion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha criticized the proposal as an attempt to appease Russia, which he believes would only lead to more war.

These images were taken in collaboration with Father Michel Quoist, a sociologist who had previously researched the same area for his doctoral thesis. The photographs depict the difficult conditions faced by the residents, highlighting the cramped and dilapidated housing, as well as everyday moments such as children playing and women washing clothes in communal spaces. The images offer a sobering glimpse into post-war French society, where many lived in poverty amidst the reconstruction period.

The parents were concerned that the curriculum, which mandated daily Christian worship and a curriculum focused almost entirely on Christian teachings, amounted to indoctrination rather than an objective, pluralistic education. The Court ruled that the curriculum’s lack of critical analysis and its exclusive promotion of Christianity violated the rights of non-religious families. As a result, the curriculum will be revised to include teachings about other religions and non-religious philosophies, and Christianity will be taught in a more balanced, critical manner.

The goal is to reduce the time it takes for military personnel and equipment to cross borders, with a target of just three days in peacetime and six hours in emergencies. Currently, moving troops and equipment, such as from the western to the eastern EU, can take months due to inadequate infrastructure.

This oversupply comes despite efforts by major oil producers to slow down production increases. The IEA attributes the growing surplus to slower-than-expected demand growth for oil worldwide, particularly in relation to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. The agency's updated energy outlook includes a scenario predicting ongoing oil demand growth until 2050, despite criticisms that it underestimates the rise of EV adoption, especially in developing nations. Additionally, the IEA's report highlights the rapid expansion of renewable energy, projecting more renewable energy projects will be built in the next five years than in the previous 40 years.

N2O is mainly produced by agricultural activities, but industrial emissions also contribute significantly. Although historically, developed countries have been the biggest emitters, recent increases have been observed in emerging economies in Asia, including China. China's success in tackling this issue is largely attributed to its 'synergistic governance' approach, which integrates pollution control with economic development goals. A key part of this strategy includes the widespread adoption of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology in coal-fired power plants, which has helped reduce N2O emissions by up to 90%. Additionally, China has introduced]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-strategy-for-reducing-n2o-emissions-and-addressing-climate-change</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-strategy-for-reducing-n2o-emissions-and-addressing-climate-change</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man Uses Laptop Batteries and Solar Power to Off-Grid His Home for Over 8 Years]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since 2016, Glubux, a self-reliant hobbyist, has been powering his home entirely off the grid using an inventive system built from laptop batteries and solar panels. His journey began with 1.4 kW of solar panels, a forklift battery, and a collection of old laptop batteries. By November of that year, he had amassed 650 laptop batteries. After sorting and testing the individual cells, he built a custom battery rack that powers his home. Over time, the setup grew with the addition of 24 more solar panels and hundreds of additional laptop batteries, all charged and stored to run appliances, lights, and even weathering grid outages. The system operates seamlessly with Victron controllers and inverters, providing reliable off-grid power for more than eight years. Glubux's battery-powered home is an impressive example of sustainable living, using repurposed technology and solar energy to stay independent of the electrical grid.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-uses-laptop-batteries-and-solar-power-to-off-grid-his-home-for-over-8-years</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-uses-laptop-batteries-and-solar-power-to-off-grid-his-home-for-over-8-years</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Artillery Overpowers NATO's Top Weapons in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Russian military continues its advance in Ukraine, utilizing overwhelming firepower to neutralize Ukrainian military capabilities. October and November were disastrous for the Ukrainian government, with at least 10,000 soldiers lost. A key part of Russia's success is its advanced artillery and missile systems, which have evolved dramatically since the start of the conflict. Initially, the Russian military faced bureaucratic delays in getting artillery support, allowing Ukrainian forces to launch successful strikes. However, over time, Russia streamlined its processes, reducing artillery response times to mere minutes, drastically outpacing NATO's advanced weapons like the HIMARS system. Russian systems like the Iskander-M and Tornado-S have proven highly effective, destroying Ukrainian high-value targets from long distances.

The plan, which has been endorsed by key U.S. officials, outlines significant political, military, and economic agreements between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia. Key points include the recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as part of Russia, with a ceasefire to be implemented after both sides retreat to agreed positions. Ukraine’s military would be capped at 600,000 personnel, and the country would not be allowed to join NATO. In exchange, Ukraine would receive security guarantees and the U.S. would provide military support in case of further Russian aggression. The plan also includes economic elements such as a large-scale reconstruction effort for Ukraine, partly funded by frozen Russian assets.

These women face some of the toughest labor conditions, working long hours with minimal breaks in small workshops subcontracted by well-known international brands like Zara, Diesel, and Levi’s. The abolition of the Multifiber Agreement in 2005 worsened the violation of their labor rights, leading to precarious work contracts and declining wages. Many workers suffer from health issues such as allergies, asthma, and musculoskeletal disorders due to poor working conditions. Despite this, the labor force remains largely passive, partly due to low levels of education and the patriarchal structure of the workplace. While Tunisia’s textile sector is critical to its economy, it is deeply embedded in the global fast fashion supply chain, which pressures workers to produce more quickly and cheaply.

These events involved wealthy individuals paying large sums of money to join sniper units and shoot at civilians from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. The investigation was prompted by a report from Italian journalist Ezio Gavazzeni, who uncovered details of these horrifying excursions. During the Bosnian War, people, including Italian nationals, traveled to Sarajevo to join Serbian sniper units and engage in this brutal form of entertainment. The prices for such excursions ranged from 80,000 to 100,000 euros. The CIA's involvement in organizing these operations through a Serbian agent, Jovica Stanisic, has also come to light.

This move directly contradicts Japan's post-World War II pacifist stance, which renounced war through Article 9 of its constitution. The article, which prohibited offensive military actions, was partially relaxed in 2015 by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who passed the Peace and Security Law, allowing for collective self-defense. Despite protests from China and internal opposition in Japan, the country has now taken a more aggressive military stance, particularly in relation to Taiwan.

The USS Stockdale, a U.S. destroyer, crossed the Seahorse's route on November 13, forcing it to change course toward Cuba. The tanker attempted to approach Venezuela twice after that but turned back each time. The ongoing U.S. naval presence in the Caribbean is seen as part of a broader strategy to limit Russia's ability to deliver fuel to Caracas, which remains heavily reliant on foreign oil despite its vast reserves. The Seahorse, along with two other sanctioned tankers, is currently idling near Venezuela.

While the swastika will no longer be categorized as a hate symbol, the Coast Guard’s new policy considers it 'potentially divisive.' Similarly, symbols like the Confederate flag and nooses, which have also been sources of racial tension, will be redefined under these updated guidelines.

The erotic engravings on the reverse side of the tokens revealed their true purpose—serving as prepaid tickets that offered discretion to both clients and madams. Clients could purchase tokens at the entrance without specifying the sexual act they desired, thus protecting their anonymity. For madams, the tokens provided an easy way to track payments and ensure fair compensation for the sex workers.

The resolution passed with 13 votes in favor and two abstentions from China and Russia, and reinstates a colonial oversight model similar to the League of Nations mandate system post-World War I. Under the new plan, Gaza is to be managed by a 'Peace Council' with a transitional administration overseeing reconstruction efforts. An International Stabilization Force (ISF) will be deployed in Gaza under a unified command, with troops contributed by several nations in cooperation with Egypt and Israel.

The lawmakers, including Senators Elissa Slotkin and Mark Kelly, and Representatives Jason Crow, Chrissy Houlahan, Maggie Goodlander, and Chris Deluzio, all of whom have military or national security backgrounds, emphasized that the Constitution permits military personnel to reject illegal commands. In their video, they warned that the Trump administration was undermining trust in the military by politicizing it and urged service members to stand firm in defending the Constitution. Trump's response on social media was swift and harsh, calling for the lawmakers' arrests, and even suggesting they should face the death penalty for their alleged sedition. His posts included re-shares of extremist comments calling for the lawmakers to be hanged, which prompted widespread backlash.

This surge in absenteeism comes amid an increase in ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids under 'Operation Charlotte's Web.' The operation, which began on November 15, 2025, resulted in more than 200 detentions, mostly targeting businesses and public areas in the region. The school district, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), confirmed that the absentee rate was over 30,000 students, with a significant portion of the district’s population identifying as Hispanic. Local authorities, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, have criticized the ICE operation, urging federal agents to focus on violent criminals instead of everyday citizens. Despite this, CMS has stated that schools would remain open, and there had been no reports of immigration enforcement on school grounds.

A new report by Infodemia claims that the demonstrations were funded and coordinated by a network of opposition figures and social media influencers, including Carlos Bello, a lifestyle influencer turned political activist. The protests, which spread across over 50 cities and left around 120 people injured, were also amplified by bot networks on platforms like Twitter and TikTok. Despite presenting themselves as apolitical, many of the key figures behind the protests have close ties to opposition parties and figures who have historically opposed the current Mexican government under President Claudia Sheinbaum.

It discusses how the amnesty, initially a demand from antifascist movements since the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1939, was not fully implemented after his death. Instead, the transition period was marked by repression against those who resisted the continuation of the fascist legacy. The author argues that the amnesty granted in 1977 did not address the real needs for justice and repair, leaving many political prisoners imprisoned and continuing to shield fascist perpetrators from accountability. Today, 50 years later, the repression has expanded to wider sectors of the popular movement, and the article calls for a total amnesty, recognition of rights, and reparations for antifascists who have suffered under fascist rule. It emphasizes that true justice cannot be achieved by simply removing symbolic medals or disregarding the pain of those oppressed.

While the EU continues to send billions in support, concerns are rising about how the funds are misused by Zelensky's inner circle. Despite the public scandal and ongoing investigations into corrupt practices, EU officials appear to downplay the seriousness of the issue. The situation is further complicated by internal divisions, with some in the EU emphasizing the need to combat corruption while others are accused of defending corrupt officials for the sake of political stability. The EU's role in Ukraine's financial aid is now under scrutiny, as it's suggested that certain European figures may be benefiting from the misappropriation of funds.

Se explica que la crisis actual difiere de la de 2008 en que no se basa en una burbuja del crédito o la construcción, sino en un fenómeno alimentado por capital extranjero especulativo y la influencia de los trabajadores remotos con altos salarios. Además, se detalla el aumento del esfuerzo económico necesario para adquirir vivienda, el 'muro de entrada' financiero que obliga a muchas familias a permanecer en el alquiler, que es más caro y consume gran parte de sus ingresos, impidiendo el ahorro.

El alto tribunal considera que estas palabras se enmarcan dentro del derecho a la libertad de expresión y forman parte de la crítica política legítima, especialmente en el contexto de la confrontación ideológica entre partidos. Según la resolución de la Sala de lo Penal, las manifestaciones de Belarra constituían una opinión política fundada en su percepción y convicción sobre la actuación del Gobierno autonómico, por lo que no suponen un delito de calumnias con publicidad, como sostenía la presidenta madrileña en su querella.

Esta tipología de paneles, producidos por la empresa española Alucoil y comercializados como Larson PE, actúa como una 'gasolina sólida' en contacto con el fuego, acelerando su propagación mediante un efecto chimenea en las fachadas ventiladas.

La sentencia subraya que la práctica de VW vulnera la Ley 15/2022 de igualdad de trato y no discriminación. Durante el juicio, UGT, CCOO y el presidente del Comité de Empresa apoyaron a la dirección, defendiendo que la exclusión de incentivos no constituía discriminación y que reflejaba un equilibrio interno del convenio.

A través de datos históricos del Banco de España y la Sociedad de Tasación, el texto muestra que mientras en los años ochenta se necesitaban entre tres y cuatro años de salario bruto para comprar una vivienda, hoy hacen falta entre ocho y catorce, dependiendo de la zona. Madrid y Barcelona destacan como epicentros de esta nueva burbuja, impulsada no por el crédito o la construcción como en 2008, sino por la entrada masiva de capital especulativo y extranjero. 

El análisis destaca varios factores: el “muro de entrada” que obliga a disponer de grandes ahorros previos para poder hipotecarse, la inflación de bienes básicos que reduce la capacidad de ahorro, y la paradoja de que alquilar es más caro que pagar una hipoteca, pero resulta inalcanzable acceder a ella.

Con 63 años y más de 35 de carrera, Peramato fue fiscal de la Sala Jefa de la Sección Penal del Supremo y fiscal delegada para la protección de víctimas. Durante su etapa como fiscal de Sala Delegada de violencia sobre la Mujer, Peramato defendió que el silencio del acusado en casos de violencia de género pudiera ser considerado un indicio más de culpabilidad, una postura que ha generado polémica entre expertos legales por cuestionar principios básicos del derecho penal, como la presunción de inocencia. Su nombramiento, apoyado por el Gobierno y respaldado por operadores jurídicos, refleja continuidad con la línea de sus predecesores socialistas Dolores Delgado y Álvaro García Ortiz, pero también evidencia su perfil ideológico en cuestiones de género.

Entre las entidades que presentaron la queja se encuentran la Associació Catalana de Juristes Demòcrates, la Asociación de Abogados Demócratas por Europa y Xustiza e Sociedade de Galiza. Las asociaciones consideran que adelantar el fallo antes de la resolución escrita vulnera la tutela judicial efectiva y provoca un linchamiento mediático del condenado. El Supremo comunicó que García Ortiz fue condenado a dos años de inhabilitación y a pagar una multa de 7.200 euros, así como una indemnización de 10.000 euros a la pareja de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, aunque la sentencia completa explicando los motivos aún no ha sido redactada.

La medida se debe a que la organización no presentó a tiempo el justificante del pago de la fianza necesaria para ejercer como acusación popular. Manos Limpias, un colectivo de ideología ultraderechista, fue el impulsor de la denuncia inicial basada en recortes de prensa —algunos de ellos posteriormente desmentidos— que sirvieron como base para abrir la causa. 

La decisión judicial se tomó el pasado 24 de noviembre, coincidiendo con la renuncia del abogado del pseudosindicato, Carlos Perales. En su escrito de salida del caso, Perales señaló que el proceso había dejado de ser un asunto jurídico para convertirse en una herramienta con fines políticos. Añadió además que la abogacía no debía confundirse con el activismo político, y que las decisiones de la organización respondían principalmente]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juez-peinado-aparta-a-manos-limpias-del-caso-begona-gomez-por-no-pagar-la-fianza-exigida</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-juez-peinado-aparta-a-manos-limpias-del-caso-begona-gomez-por-no-pagar-la-fianza-exigida</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 22:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El IMV se otorgará automáticamente a quienes agoten el subsidio de desempleo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno ha puesto en marcha un nuevo procedimiento que permitirá que las personas desempleadas que agoten su prestación o subsidio por desempleo y no hayan encontrado un nuevo trabajo pasen a percibir el Ingreso Mínimo Vital (IMV) de manera automática. Esta medida, anunciada por el Ministerio de Seguridad Social, Inclusión y Migraciones, busca evitar interrupciones en los ingresos de los hogares más vulnerables y reducir la carga administrativa para los ciudadanos. Según los últimos datos del Instituto de la Seguridad Social, más de 773.000 hogares con 2,3 millones de personas ya reciben esta prestación, cuyo importe medio ronda los 487 euros mensuales. El cambio se enmarca en el Real Decreto-Ley 2/2024, que ha simplificado diversos requisitos para acceder al IMV, incluyendo la reducción de trabas relativas a las parejas de hecho y la eliminación de la necesidad de que todos los adultos de la unidad de convivencia firmen la solicitud.

ICE sostiene que Ventura no figura en su base de datos, y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional asegura que no registraron a nadie con ese nombre durante los arrestos en esas fechas.

Más del 25% de la población vive en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social, situando a España como el cuarto país con peores cifras en la UE, solo por delante de Bulgaria, Rumanía y Grecia. La pobreza infantil es aún más alarmante: más del 34% de los menores están en riesgo, superando a países con ingresos similares como Eslovenia, donde solo un 10% de los niños se encuentra en esta situación. Además, la pobreza estructural persiste durante décadas, afectando a entre 6 y 7 millones de personas, lo que dificulta la movilidad social. El empleo tampoco garantiza seguridad económica: el 11,2% de los trabajadores españoles es pobre, una de las cifras más altas de Europa occidental.

Según el Ministerio Fiscal, la forense realizó juicios de valor improcedentes y culpabilizó a las víctimas durante las exploraciones médicas, lo que llevó a algunas de ellas a desistir de sus denuncias. Los hechos investigados se centran en tres episodios ocurridos entre 2019 y 2022 en hospitales sevillanos. En uno de ellos, una joven de 25 años recibió comentarios insinuando que era responsable de su agresión por haber salido de madrugada, lo que la llevó a no denunciar. En otro caso, una mujer hallada semiconsciente fue increpada por su supuesta embriaguez y tampoco se extrajeron muestras biológicas, mientras que una tercera víctima fue interrogada en tono acusatorio, sugiriendo que su relato podía no ser veraz.

Ordóñez reprocha a Ayuso que intente dividir a las víctimas en bandos y defendió que tanto las víctimas de la memoria histórica como las de ETA merecen igual derecho a la reparación. Además, acusó a Ayuso de insistir en hablar de ETA en 2025, cuando la banda se disolvió hace años. También denunció el uso electoral que el Partido Popular hace de las víctimas de ETA, calificando ese trato como una falta de respeto y un ataque a la dignidad de las víctimas.

Estos mensajes, encontrados en un grupo de WhatsApp llamado 'Naranjito', datan entre 2017 y 2020 y reflejan una comunicación cifrada entre García y sus exvicepresidentes Fernando Giménez y Óscar Liria.

El procedimiento se inició después de que una persona llamara desde Madrid para denunciar la existencia de un vídeo difundido por el propio hostelero en redes sociales, donde se veía una discusión en la terraza del establecimiento. La Policía Nacional remitió el vídeo al juzgado, lo que dio lugar a la apertura de diligencias, pese a no haber denuncia directa de los supuestos perjudicados, dado que los delitos de odio son perseguibles de oficio.

El magistrado reconoció que resulta “feo oírlo en boca de un juez”, pero insistió en que en la realidad jurídica española este precepto se vulnera de manera constante sin consecuencias.

Este hecho coincide con la presencia de Vilaplana y el president Carlos Mazón en Valencia, quienes, según testimonios, habían abandonado el restaurante El Ventorro y se encontraban en la plaza de Tetuán. La publicación confirma que este momento forma parte de un periodo de 37 minutos de desconexión del president entre las 18:57 y las 19:34 horas. Además, se constata que Mazón no atendió una llamada de la exconsellera Salomé Pradas destinada a informarle sobre el envío del Es Alert.

El vuelo tenía como destino Dublín y el incidente se produjo justo cuando la aeronave se preparaba para entrar en la pista de despegue, lo que obligó a cancelar la maniobra. Las causas del altercado aún no se han esclarecido. Según la Asociación Unificada de la Guardia Civil (AUGC), los agentes intervinieron tras un episodio de descontrol de la pasajera, que opuso una fuerte resistencia durante la detención, lo que derivó en lesiones para los efectivos.

El portavoz de la Oficina de Asuntos de Taiwán, Peng Qing'en, calificó la medida japonesa de 'provocación extremadamente peligrosa' y acusó a Japón de alimentar la confrontación militar en una zona especialmente sensible del Pacífico. Según Pekín, el despliegue viola el espíritu pacifista de la Constitución japonesa y representa una preocupante expansión militar impulsada por fuerzas derechistas. Los comentarios se producen tras las declaraciones de la primera ministra japonesa, Sanae Takaichi, quien sugirió que un ataque chino a Taiwán podría justificar la intervención militar de Japón, lo que ha desatado una nueva oleada de tensión diplomática entre ambos países.

La cifra supera en unos 31.000 fallecidos los datos oficiales proporcionados por las autoridades gazatíes, que sitúan el número de víctimas en torno a 69.000. El estudio, en el que también participó el Centro de Estudios Demográficos de Barcelona, se basó en fuentes del Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, la ONG israelí B'Tselem, la ONU y organismos de estadística palestinos.

Fundado por Eugene Mulvihill, comenzó en 1976 con un tobogán alpino y se expandió rápidamente, incorporando nuevas atracciones acuáticas y de motor, como el Waterworld y Motorworld. El parque se hizo famoso por sus atracciones peligrosas, entre ellas el Cannonball Loop, un tobogán cerrado con un bucle vertical, y la piscina de olas Tidal Wave, donde ocurrieron múltiples ahogamientos. Otras atracciones como Alpine Slide, Roaring Rapids y Tarzan Swing también estuvieron marcadas por numerosos accidentes y lesiones graves. La combinación de diseño poco seguro, mantenimiento irregular y personal juvenil contribuyó a su reputación de parque «sin ley».

Aunque las autoridades madrileñas, encabezadas por Isabel Díaz Ayuso y José Luis Martínez-Almeida, han negado problemas en el calendario, diferentes filtraciones procedentes de Liberty Media indican que la organización tiene serias dudas sobre que el proyecto pueda completarse a tiempo. Medios internacionales, como RMC Motori, han publicado descripciones del estado actual de las obras que muestran maquinaria parada, áreas sin avances recientes y zonas claves —como la destinada al edificio de boxes— en condiciones muy precarias. Estas informaciones apuntan a Imola como el circuito mejor posicionado para sustituir a Madrid en caso de que no se llegue a tiempo.

Aunque se ha difundido la idea de que los jóvenes prefieren estilos de vida más flexibles antes que comprar una casa, los expertos coinciden en que el verdadero obstáculo es económico. Según la Red para el Rescate de la Vivienda (REVIVE), desde 2005 el precio de la vivienda ha aumentado nueve veces más rápido que el salario promedio, lo que ha convertido el acceso a una vivienda en un lujo inalcanzable. Entre los factores que agravan la situación están la limitada oferta de nuevas viviendas, los procesos burocráticos que frenan la construcción y los salarios insuficientes. Muchos jóvenes destinan hasta el 40% de sus ingresos al alquiler, lo que hace casi imposible ahorrar para un enganche o acceder a un crédito hipotecario. Esta brecha económica ha provocado consecuencias sociales graves, como el aumento de los fraudes inmobiliarios y la proliferación de asentami]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-precio-de-la-vivienda-en-mexico-crece-mucho-mas-rapido-que-los-salarios-y-deja-fuera-a-los-jovenes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-precio-de-la-vivienda-en-mexico-crece-mucho-mas-rapido-que-los-salarios-y-deja-fuera-a-los-jovenes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más Madrid pide explicaciones a Idealista y Fotocasa por el impacto de sus algoritmos en los precios de la vivienda]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las diputadas de Más Madrid, Tesh Sidi y Alda Recas, han solicitado la comparecencia en el Congreso de los Diputados de representantes de los portales inmobiliarios Idealista y Fotocasa para aclarar cómo funcionan y qué efectos tienen sus algoritmos en el mercado de la vivienda.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el gobierno de Giorgia Meloni, busca dar respuesta al aumento de asesinatos y agresiones contra mujeres en el país, así como reforzar las herramientas institucionales para combatir la violencia de género.

La ley contempla medidas más estrictas para delitos relacionados, como el acoso y la difusión no consentida de imágenes íntimas (conocido como revenge porn).

Estos productos contienen compuestos que pueden acumularse en el suelo y los alimentos, con posibles efectos tóxicos a largo plazo, como daños al hígado y problemas reproductivos.

La protesta ha logrado que el gobierno declare la violencia de género como desastre nacional, lo que obliga a destinar más recursos y medidas específicas para su prevención. A pesar de los marcos legales existentes, las tasas de feminicidio permanecen elevadas, según la ONU y el Instituto de Criminología de la Universidad de Ciudad del Cabo.

En Novorossiysk, un ataque con misil Neptune dañó un puerto clave que maneja alrededor del 2% del flujo mundial de petróleo, mientras que la refinería de Ryazan fue atacada por quinta vez. Las operaciones diarias de drones ucranianos siguen golpeando refinerías y otros puntos estratégicos. Los envíos de petróleo ruso han descendido en 130.000 barriles diarios y el 35% de los petroleros cargados no tienen destino final, dejando unos 350 millones de barriles retenidos en el mar.

Estas cuentas, algunas con miles de seguidores, utilizaban tecnologías como la inteligencia artificial para amplificar mensajes de odio, racismo y antisemitismo, muchas veces con fines económicos o de manipulación política. La plataforma ha sido criticada por su escasa moderación y por permitir que las cuentas verificadas se compren, dificultando diferenciar entre usuarios legítimos y perfiles manipuladores.

Lagarde destacó que el modelo de crecimiento europeo, basado en la globalización y las exportaciones, está desfasado y ya no ofrece los beneficios de antaño. Durante las dos últimas décadas, la UE experimentó una fuerte integración global, pero hoy esa apertura ha generado vulnerabilidades. Las exportaciones, que antes eran un motor de crecimiento, han dejado de ser una fuente fiable debido a factores como la guerra en Ucrania, los aranceles estadounidenses y la creciente competencia de China. La presidenta del BCE subrayó que, en lugar de seguir esperando a que otros resuelvan estos problemas, Europa debe centrarse en mejorar su mercado único, eliminando barreras internas y facilitando el comercio dentro de la UE.

Sin embargo, si los utilizamos para almacenamiento a largo plazo sin alimentación, pueden perder datos con el tiempo. La memoria NAND de los SSDs almacena información mediante cargas eléctricas, pero esta retención no es indefinida. Por ejemplo, los SSDs con QLC pueden conservar datos aproximadamente un año sin energía, los de TLC hasta 3 años, mientras que los MLC y SLC pueden llegar a 5 y 10 años respectivamente. La mayoría de los consumidores usan SSDs de QLC o TLC, por lo que dejar un disco sin uso más de un año implica un riesgo de pérdida de datos. Otros factores como la temperatura y la calidad de la memoria también aceleran esta degradación. Para la mayoría de los usuarios que usan SSDs como almacenamiento primario, esto no supone un problema, ya que los reemplazan antes de agotar su vida útil. No obstante, para almacenamiento a largo plazo, se recomie]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ssds-sin-uso-prolongado-pueden-perder-datos-precauciones-y-alternativas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-ssds-sin-uso-prolongado-pueden-perder-datos-precauciones-y-alternativas</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 04:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bolsonaro comienza a cumplir su condena por intento de golpe de Estado]]></title><description><![CDATA[El expresidente brasileño Jair Bolsonaro ha comenzado a cumplir una condena de 27 años y tres meses de prisión por su implicación en un intento de golpe de Estado destinado a impedir la investidura de su sucesor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, tras su derrota electoral en 2022. La Corte Suprema de Brasil dio por agotadas todas las vías de recurso y ordenó el ingreso inmediato del exmandatario en una sala de doce metros cuadrados ubicada en la sede de la Policía Federal en Brasilia, donde ya se encontraba desde el sábado tras haber dañado la tobillera electrónica que debía portar como medida cautelar.

Según sus testimonios, las agencias de empleo que facilitan su llegada les prometen salarios competitivos y condiciones estables, pero en la práctica muchos se encuentran con deducciones salariales inesperadas, viviendas precarias y un alto grado de dependencia respecto a la empresa que les contrata y les aloja. Esto genera un clima de inseguridad constante: perder el empleo puede significar también quedarse sin techo. 

El artículo recoge el caso de Luis Pereira, un joven gallego de 26 años que, tras cambiar de agencia atraído por un pequeño aumento salarial, comenzó a experimentar obstáculos administrativos y falta de transparencia.

Según Aznar, España no enfrenta un grave problema migratorio, ya que la principal inmigración proviene de países hispanoamericanos, cuyos ciudadanos, afirma, se integran fácilmente debido a la cercanía histórica, cultural, lingüística y religiosa. Afirma que esta comunidad inmigrante viene principalmente a trabajar y no presenta dificultades de integración. Sin embargo, Aznar distingue a la inmigración musulmana, a la que atribuye problemas de integración, argumentando que algunos inmigrantes musulmanes no buscan adaptarse a la sociedad española sino que desean que sus leyes sean reconocidas. Estas declaraciones han generado debate sobre la visión de la inmigración y la integración cultural en España, así como sobre los posibles matices y estereotipos que pueden derivarse de ellas.

La jueza considera que no hay pruebas de que Faya se apoderara ilícitamente de los documentos que posteriormente sirvieron para destapar la presunta trama de sobornos a funcionarios argelinos a cambio de contratos millonarios para la empresa vasca Elecnor. La sentencia recalca que entregar documentos a la Fiscalía Anticorrupción no constituye delito de revelación de secretos, y que los materiales estaban en poder de Faya por su propio trabajo en el despacho Voltar Lassen, dirigido junto a los dos exdiputados. La resolución contradice la versión de Gómez de la Serna, quien lo acusó de extorsión y de difundir información a terceros, acusaciones que tampoco se pudieron probar.

El hallazgo forma parte de un proyecto de conservación medioambiental desarrollado junto a la Fundación Endesa y el Cabildo de Tenerife, centrado en la restauración y protección de los cedrales del Teide. Este descubrimiento supera al hasta ahora récord del llamado Bárbol, otro ejemplar de la misma zona con 1.481 años.

El trabajo de campo ha sido liderado por la Escuela de Ingeniería de la Industria Forestal, Agronómica y de la Bioenergía (EiFAB), cuyos miembros, con la ayuda de escaladores especializados, accedieron a zonas casi inaccesibles del parque para recoger muestras de madera y datarlas mediante carbono 14. Gracias a estas técnicas, se han datado 25 ejemplares de cedros, de los cuales ocho resultaron ser milenarios y tres superan los 1.500 años. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-cedro-canario-de-1-544-anos-es-identificado-como-el-arbol-mas-antiguo-de-la-union-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-cedro-canario-de-1-544-anos-es-identificado-como-el-arbol-mas-antiguo-de-la-union-europea</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La UPC dice que no hay déficit estructural de vivienda en España y que construir más no garantiza bajar precios]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio reciente del Centro de Política de Suelo y Valoraciones de la Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) contradice la visión del Banco de España sobre la vivienda. Según este análisis, España no enfrenta un déficit estructural de viviendas, ya que entre 2011 y 2021 el parque de viviendas creció más que el número de hogares, acumulando un excedente de más de 8 millones de viviendas, con casi 4 millones vacías. El acceso a la vivienda es cada vez más difícil debido a los precios historicamente altos, con un aumento del 13,8% en venta y del 40% en alquiler en comparación con 2007. Sin embargo, el estudio advierte que construir más viviendas no necesariamente reduce los precios, a menos que se enfoquen en viviendas asequibles y sociales, que actualmente representan menos del 10% de las transacciones y se han reducido al 7,8% en 2024. Asimismo, identifica factores que tensan el mercado, como el crecimiento del alquiler turístico, la expansión del alojamiento vacacional y la poca]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-dice-que-no-hay-deficit-estructural-de-vivienda-en-espana-y-que-construir-mas-no-garantiza-bajar-precios</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-dice-que-no-hay-deficit-estructural-de-vivienda-en-espana-y-que-construir-mas-no-garantiza-bajar-precios</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reyes Maroto abandona el Pleno de Madrid tras un duro enfrentamiento con Almeida]]></title><description><![CDATA[En un tenso Pleno del Ayuntamiento de Madrid, la portavoz socialista Reyes Maroto abandonó el salón después de un intercambio de acusaciones con el alcalde, José Luis Martínez-Almeida.

Almeida acusó a Maroto de estar rodeada de 'corrupción esférica' y de haber mentido en una comisión de investigación, además de vincularla con casos relacionados con Víctor Aldama y supuestos viajes con empresarios como Globalia y personas próximas al PSOE. Maroto, visiblemente molesta, pidió al alcalde que dejara de usar el 'comodín de Bildu' y le instó a acudir a los tribunales si tenía pruebas de irregularidades. Tras soportar varios ataques, decidió salir del Pleno manifestando estar 'harta' de las acusaciones.

Este texto, junto a otros ensayos, se publican por primera vez en España en la obra 'Desde un bosque lejano' (Errata naturae, 2025). Kaczynski critica la Revolución Industrial, considerándola un desastre que aumentó la esperanza de vida pero provocó daños sociales, psicológicos y ecológicos. Denuncia una humanidad 'hipersocializada' y atrapada en 'actividades sustitutas' insatisfactorias, además de prever peligros como la ingeniería genética, la crisis ecológica y la ascensión de la inteligencia artificial.

El alto tribunal, con ponencia del magistrado Pablo Llarena, entiende que las palabras de Belarra forman parte de una crítica política amparada por la libertad de expresión, reforzada además por su condición de diputada. Según la resolución, el tribunal recuerda que la jurisprudencia del Tribunal Constitucional reconoce que la libertad de expresión protege incluso las críticas duras o exageradas, especialmente en el contexto político, donde se ejerce el debate democrático.

La nueva marca ha perdido parte del reconocimiento que durante décadas tuvo Cepsa, lo que ha obligado a Moeve a incluir de forma destacada la coletilla “antes Cepsa” en sus estaciones de servicio, anuncios y soportes digitales, para evitar la confusión del público. Según los analistas, el error principal radica en la desconexión entre la nueva identidad y el imaginario asociado a la vieja marca, además de una transición demasiado rápida que no dio tiempo al cliente para adaptarse ni para asociar el nuevo nombre con la empresa original.

El autor, Alfredo Mourelos Muñiz, expone que las crisis son fenómenos capaces de alterar profundamente la estabilidad financiera, social y política de los países, afectando a millones de personas. Comienza definiendo qué es una crisis económica y destaca tres elementos comunes: el endeudamiento incontrolado, la formación de burbujas financieras y el pánico de los inversores ante la pérdida de confianza en los mercados. A partir de ahí, analiza dos episodios recientes de especial relevancia. En primer lugar, la Gran Recesión de 2008, iniciada en el mercado hipotecario estadounidense y que desencadenó quiebras bancarias, destrucción masiva de empleo y una lenta recuperación global. En segundo lugar, la crisis de la deuda soberana europea entre 2010 y 2012, que afectó gravemente a países como Grecia, España, Portugal e Italia y dio lugar a intervenciones de la T]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-analisis-de-las-crisis-economicas-recientes-y-sus-lecciones</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-analisis-de-las-crisis-economicas-recientes-y-sus-lecciones</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 16:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El aumento del sinhogarismo en Madrid y la dificultad de medirlo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Madrid, a pesar de ser una de las regiones más ricas de España, más de 1,3 millones de personas viven en riesgo de pobreza y exclusión social, un número que ha aumentado tras la pandemia. Entre estas personas se encuentra un grupo especialmente vulnerable: los sin hogar, mayoritariamente hombres y un 30% menores de 30 años. Muchos de ellos trabajan en empleos precarios que no les permiten alquilar una vivienda. La realidad del sinhogarismo se concentra sobre todo en el distrito Centro, seguido por Arganzuela, Tetuán y Puente de Vallecas, lugares que ofrecen más seguridad y vigilancia. La falta de datos precisos complica conocer la verdadera magnitud del fenómeno, ya que desde la llegada del PP y Ciudadanos al Ayuntamiento se dejó de realizar el recuento anual. Según datos del INE, unas 4.500 personas utilizaron centros de alojamiento en 2024, pero las ONG estiman que la cifra real es mucho mayor.

Tras constatar que la empresa del aparcamiento había eliminado los registros de entradas y salidas por haber transcurrido más de un año, la magistrada optó por rastrear el pago del ticket. Para ello requirió a la periodista sus datos bancarios con el fin de identificar el cargo correspondiente entre el listado de pagos facilitado por la empresa. El análisis determinó que el único cobro de 15,10 euros asociado a su tarjeta corresponde a una salida del aparcamiento a las 19:47 horas.

Esto implica, según el testimonio del propietario de El Ventorro, que Vilaplana abandonó el aparcamiento casi una hora después de haber salido del restaurante junto al president Carlos Mazón, quien según ese testimonio se marchó entre las 18:30 y las 19:00.

Esta nueva versión apuesta por una mezcla de nostalgia y tecnología moderna, destacando especialmente el uso de inteligencia artificial para moderar contenido y personalizar la experiencia. Además, han implementado un programa llamado Groundbreakers que permite a los usuarios asegurar su nombre de usuario previo pago de 5 dólares, buscando evitar el acaparamiento de nombres por bots y financiando causas benéficas con estos fondos. Sin embargo, esta estrategia ha generado dudas y críticas, ya que algunos consideran que la plataforma debería poder resolver esos problemas desde su diseño sin cobrar a los usuarios.

Durante su declaración, Olivera ha responsabilizado a dos subordinados —un comisario principal y un inspector jefe— de la investigación que vinculaba a Urbán con la supuesta venta de 40 kilos de cocaína en un pub de Malasaña.

En aquella ocasión, Ruiz afirmó que Pérez pidió en redes sociales violar en masa a la hija del presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, mientras sonaba el himno nacional. Según el texto judicial al que ha tenido acceso 'The Objective', el dirigente de Se Acabó la Fiesta sostiene que esta afirmación constituye una imputación falsa y gravemente lesiva para su reputación. 

La demanda reclama una indemnización de 65.000 euros por daños morales, argumentando que el programa se emitió en horario de máxima audiencia en una cadena pública y con alcance estatal, provocando un perjuicio inmediato y de gran repercusión. Pérez también indica que el daño se amplificó cuando el fragmento fue difundido masivamente en redes sociales.

Los secuestradores utilizaron motocicletas para controlar a los niños, muchos de los cuales fueron golpeados al intentar escapar. La policía local afirmó que solo había constancia de unos pocos desaparecidos, mientras que el gobernador del estado cuestionó el número de secuestrados y responsabilizó a la escuela por permanecer abierta pese a las amenazas previas. La situación ha generado frustración y desolación entre los padres, que denuncian sentirse abandonados por el gobierno.

La transición de marca, pensada para modernizar la imagen de la empresa energética, ha provocado confusión entre los consumidores y críticas en redes sociales y foros especializados. Debido a la pérdida de reconocimiento inmediato de la marca histórica Cepsa, la empresa se ha visto obligada a añadir la coletilla “antes Cepsa” en carteles, estaciones de servicio, anuncios y comunicaciones internas. Expertos en marketing consideran que este rebranding es un ejemplo de cómo no gestionar un cambio de identidad corporativa, señalando la desconexión con la percepción previa de los clientes, la falta de preparación del público y el elevado coste de reetiquetar toda la comunicación visual.

A pesar de ello, la clasificación para el Mundial de 1990 y la organización del Mundial de 1994 impulsaron el crecimiento del deporte. La Major League Soccer (MLS) ha crecido con la influencia de jugadores internacionales y el desarrollo de categorías inferiores, pero todavía lucha por superar la popularidad dominante de la NFL, NBA y MLB en el país.

Según el análisis del catedrático Julio López Laborda, el 1% de los hogares con mayores ingresos paga solo el 24% de su renta en impuestos, frente al 27,5% de los hogares con ingresos más bajos. Esta diferencia se explica por la alta presencia de rentas de capital entre los más ricos, que tributan a tipos más bajos, y por la regresividad de impuestos indirectos como el IVA, que grava proporcionalmente más a quienes menos ingresos tienen. En contraste, los hogares de renta baja son los principales beneficiarios netos de la intervención pública, recibiendo ayudas monetarias y en especie. El sistema español logra reducir un 32,5% de la desigualdad, por debajo del 40% que se observa en la media europea, y apenas un 2,5% de esta reducción proviene de los impuestos directos.

Israel justifica estos ataques como respuesta a infiltraciones de combatientes armados de Hamás en su territorio, calificando estas acciones como violaciones flagrantes del alto el fuego. Por su parte, Hamás acusa a Israel de fabricar pretextos para reanudar la ofensiva, y solicita a Estados Unidos, promotor del acuerdo de tregua, que frene las acciones israelíes que socavan el cese al fuego. El primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, ha respaldado las operaciones militares recientes y ha advertido que Israel impondrá un alto precio por las supuestas violaciones de Hamás.

Al igual que ocurrió con el volcán Tambora en 1815, cuya erupción provocó el llamado “año sin verano”, un evento similar hoy tendría efectos aún más graves debido al calentamiento global y a la densidad de población actual. Markus Stoffel, climatólogo de la Universidad de Ginebra, señala que la probabilidad de una erupción masiva en los próximos cien años es de una entre seis. Estas erupciones liberan grandes cantidades de anhidrita de azufre que, al alcanzar la estratosfera, forman aerosoles capaces de reflejar la luz solar y enfriar el planeta durante varios años.

Sin embargo, la vida del actor fue mucho más compleja y profunda que su personaje más célebre. Nacido en California en 1932, hijo de inmigrantes japoneses, pasó gran parte de su infancia en hospitales debido a una grave tuberculosis espinal que casi le impidió caminar. Tras una dura operación, aprendió de nuevo a moverse y encontró en la imaginación y las historias una vía de escape que lo llevó hacia la interpretación.

Durante la investigación, el teléfono se reinició automáticamente, borrando posibles pruebas, un comportamiento que podría deberse a funciones legítimas de seguridad del sistema, como el reinicio automático o el PIN de coacción. La prensa francesa llegó a calificar GrapheneOS como una herramienta para criminales, incluyendo acusaciones infundadas sobre funciones como un “falso Snapchat”, que el equipo de desarrollo ha negado rotundamente.

Los documentos muestran que Chomsky mantuvo conversaciones frecuentes con Epstein sobre política, música y posibles viajes, y que llegó a recibir 270.000 dólares de una cuenta vinculada al financiero, contradiciendo declaraciones anteriores en las que aseguraba no haber recibido dinero de él. Entre los archivos figura un borrador de carta de recomendación de Chomsky para Epstein, destacando la ayuda de este último para entender el sistema financiero global y su capacidad para facilitar encuentros con figuras relevantes, como diplomáticos noruegos y el ex primer ministro israelí Ehud Barak.

La obra, un retrato de Valentín Belvís de Moncada Pizarro, permaneció durante años en la casa de Fernando Ramírez de Haro hasta que, presionado por sus acreedores, decidió venderla en 2012 a través de Sotheby’s. La operación se cerró por 5.800.000 euros, de los que la casa de subastas retuvo 684.400 euros. 
La disputa entre los hermanos comenzó en la vía penal, después de que Íñigo acusara a Fernando de engañarlo mediante una supuesta donación falsa destinada a facilitar la venta. Aunque la Audiencia de Madrid reconoció en 2023 que la donación había sido “inventada”, concluyó que no había delito al tratarse de un acuerdo entre familiares, cerrando así la vía penal.

El texto expone cómo el sistema griego buscaba limitar la influencia de los ricos mediante mecanismos como el misthón y la imposición de impuestos a las élites, promoviendo la redistribución de la riqueza y el bien común. Además, se rastrea la preocupación histórica sobre la oligarquía en pensadores como Maquiavelo y Adam Smith, quienes alertaron sobre los peligros de permitir que los ricos concentren poder político y económico. A lo largo de la historia, desde la Revolución Francesa hasta la actualidad, se constata que las élites tienden a preservar sus privilegios, lo que exige la intervención activa del Estado y la sociedad para proteger la democracia y el bienestar de la mayoría.

Según la resolución judicial, la fiscal Lindsey Halligan —nombrada directamente por Donald Trump como fiscal federal interina para el Distrito Este de Virginia— fue designada de forma ilegal, lo que invalida las imputaciones que había impulsado. Currie concluye que Halligan no tenía la autoridad legal necesaria para presentar cargos, ya que su nombramiento vulneraba los límites establecidos para los fiscales interinos y, por tanto, contravenía tanto la Constitución estadounidense como la legislación federal sobre nombramientos.

Por su parte, Pascual Vives defiende que fue contratado por sus méritos profesionales y su discreción, además de su calidad humana.

El secretario de Comercio estadounidense, Howard Lutnick, dejó claro que la revisión de las normas digitales sería un paso previo para abordar el contencioso sobre los aranceles.

Alonso optó por un esquema flexible entre 3-5-2 y 4-4-2 que buscaba asegurar la superioridad numérica en defensa y dominar la posesión, aunque esto conllevó una pérdida de nivel individual que luego se corrigió con cambios de jugadores más ofensivos.

Esta sociedad obtuvo un préstamo de Madrid Network para organizar un festival de música en Matadero, financiado por la Comunidad de Madrid.

Cada número incluía una cinta con 10 programas variados, abarcando juegos, utilidades y programas educativos, acompañados de un pequeño librito con instrucciones para cada programa. La calidad de los juegos y utilidades era desigual, pero siempre existía la esperanza de encontrar alguna joya oculta que capturase el interés. La revista no protegía sus programas para permitir a los usuarios acceder a los listados y aprender sobre programación, incentivando a los lectores a participar con premios económicos por juegos enviados.

La sentencia le atribuye delitos de blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, relacionados con sus actividades privadas tras abandonar la Xunta. La investigación determinó que la compañía Hafesa Energía, en la que Uzal ocupaba cargos de dirección, y otras empresas instrumentales defraudaron un total de 154,7 millones de euros de IVA entre 2016 y 2019, beneficiándose de precios más competitivos para colocar grandes cantidades de hidrocarburo. Además de las penas de prisión, los condenados deberán pagar multas que superan los cien millones de euros.

Actualmente, quienes poseen entre 1,76 y 20,7 millones de coronas pagan un 1%, y los que superan esa cifra, un 1,1%. En 2023, cerca del 12% de la población contribuyó a este tributo, que aporta alrededor del 0,6% del PIB nacional. Pese a su aparente éxito recaudatorio y su papel en sostener una sociedad muy igualitaria, la medida ha tenido efectos colaterales: más de un centenar de las 400 personas más ricas del país se han mudado al extranjero, principalmente a Suiza y otros destinos con menor presión fiscal. Para evitar fugas tributarias, el Gobierno ha endurecido incluso el llamado “impuesto de salida” sobre las plusvalías no realizadas, que alcanza el 37,8% para ciertos patrimonios. El debate divide profundamente a la opinión pública y la clase política.

La Policía Nacional Revolucionaria (PNR) cubana llevaba meses al tanto de su presencia en la isla y lo mantenía bajo vigilancia, pero no procedió a su arresto hasta hace pocos días.

El proceso se enmarca en una pieza separada del conocido caso Tándem, que investiga las actividades delictivas atribuidas a Villarejo. Según la acusación, López Madrid habría contratado al excomisario para acosar a la doctora Elisa Pinto, aunque la Fiscalía Anticorrupción no aprecia indicios suficientes de pago o dádiva entre ambos. La vista oral está prevista en seis sesiones, que se desarrollarán del 12 al 15 y los días 19 y 20 de enero.

Perales recalca que la abogacía no debe confundirse con activismo político ni convertirse en un instrumento de comunicación pública, y que la defensa jurídica no puede subordinarse a la repercusión mediática o a i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-abogado-de-manos-limpias-renuncia-a-representar-a-begona-gomez-por-motivos-eticos-y-politicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-abogado-de-manos-limpias-renuncia-a-representar-a-begona-gomez-por-motivos-eticos-y-politicos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 04:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Influencia ideológica en decisiones judiciales de alto perfil en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia analiza la reciente polémica en torno a la sentencia apócrifa del Tribunal Supremo contra el Fiscal General del Estado, destacando cómo la ideología de los jueces puede influir en decisiones judiciales con connotaciones políticas. Antonio Maestre critica que, en casos de alto perfil político como este o el juicio del Procés, lo jurídico se ve mediado por intereses y subjetividades, y no sólo por la ley y la justicia objetiva. El artículo también denuncia el trato de favor hacia la hija de Manuel Marchena en su carrera judicial, evidenciando cómo algunos miembros de la élite judicial pueden operar con reglas distintas al resto. Maestre subraya que este fenómeno no es raro, sino normal dentro de la burbuja social y profesional en la que viven ciertos jueces, quienes combinan capital social, conexiones y privilegios que les generan una sensación de impunidad. Se cuestiona la capacidad del sistema judicial para actuar con imparcialidad en estos contextos, y se destaca la tensión]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/influencia-ideologica-en-decisiones-judiciales-de-alto-perfil-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/influencia-ideologica-en-decisiones-judiciales-de-alto-perfil-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 04:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Naomi Klein analiza la influencia de la riqueza extrema en el poder y la política global]]></title><description><![CDATA[En esta entrevista, Naomi Klein reflexiona sobre lo que denomina el 'fascismo del fin de los tiempos', un fenómeno que vincula la extrema riqueza de los multimillonarios tecnológicos con el surgimiento de movimientos políticos autoritarios y apocalípticos. Klein describe cómo figuras como Jeff Bezos o Elon Musk preparan búnkeres y planifican la colonización de Marte mientras ignoran los problemas críticos de la humanidad, como el cambio climático, las pandemias o los conflictos internacionales. La autora enfatiza que la cultura popular y la ciencia ficción son malinterpretadas por estos multimillonarios, convirtiendo advertencias en manuales de supervivencia elitista. La entrevista también analiza las coaliciones políticas, como la base de votantes de Trump, y cómo algunos sectores de la clase trabajadora pueden sentirse engañados al apoyar políticas que favorecen a la élite tecnológica.

Además, se mencionan posibles vínculos de Epstein con agencias de inteligencia israelíes y la participación del ex primer ministro Ehud Barak en algunas operaciones de intermediación y seguridad. La noticia también destaca patrones históricos de espionaje y chantaje de Israel, incluyendo casos relacionados con Bill Clinton y la política estadounidense.

La Hermandad de Académicos busca instruir ideológicamente a jóvenes y ha participado en la difusión de propaganda prorrusa. El evento reunió a miembros de la APF, entre los que se encontraban figuras como Roberto Fiore, Nick Griffin y Claus Cremer, defensores de teorías supremacistas y negacionistas del Holocausto.

La petrolera había rechazado el acuerdo de liquidación de 2010, que le suponía un pago de 101.440.503,87 euros, así como los de los ejercicios posteriores, de los que no resultaba deuda adicional. Hacienda no reconoció a Repsol varios establecimientos permanentes en Argelia, Libia, Perú y Ecuador, lo que incrementó la deuda exigida. Repsol argumentó que las asociaciones y consorcios en los que participaba constituían establecimientos permanentes independientes, no un único establecimiento junto con la oficina central. La Sala ha aceptado parcialmente estos argumentos, concretamente respecto a Argelia y Libia, permitiendo a la compañía ahorrarse gran parte de los más de 101 millones de euros que debía pagar.

Las autoridades argumentan que las estudiantes no acuden al centro que les correspondería en la región, ubicado en Huesca, a más de 50 kilómetros. Sin embargo, el instituto de Lleida se encuentra a menos de 30 kilómetros, lo que supone un trayecto más corto y accesible para las familias. Este servicio de transporte se había iniciado hace 12 años mediante un taxi escolar para facilitar el acceso a los niños con discapacidad. Actualmente, solo quedan dos alumnas que utilizan este servicio, tras el fallecimiento de otra estudiante el año pasado, y por ello el gobierno ha decidido cancelarlo.

Esta situación se debe a una ley aprobada en 2022 por Navarra Suma y Geroa Bai que obliga a mantener sus contratos, independientemente de que no impartan clases. Esto genera un gasto anual de más de 2 millones de euros. Los docentes de Religión no pueden impartir otras materias ni actuar como tutores; sus tareas dependen de las asignaciones de los centros. La selección de los profesores no sigue procesos públicos como oposiciones, sino que la realiza el Arzobispado, que exige únicamente la declaración eclesiástica de idoneidad y estar bautizado como católico. El Gobierno paga sus nóminas, pero no interviene en la elección ni en la revocación de la idoneidad, lo que convierte estas plazas en un mandato eclesiástico denominado 'missio canonica'.

La sentencia, dictada por la Sección Tercera de la Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo, reconoce el perjuicio moral y las consecuencias personales y familiares que sufrió el afectado debido a una privación de libertad que el tribunal considera injusta y evitable. El ingreso en prisión se produjo en junio de 2021 por orden de un juzgado de Berja, y tras el juicio celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 3 de Almería, el hombre fue declarado inocente y puesto en libertad inmediata. 
 
La compensación se dividirá en 4.800 euros por daño moral y 10.200 euros por lucro cesante, es decir, por los ingresos que el agricultor dejó de percibir durante su periodo en prisión.

Conocido por su inconfundible mirada y su presencia inquietante, Kier se convirtió en un icono de la contracultura LGTBI y del cine de culto desde los años setenta. Su vida estuvo marcada desde el nacimiento, en un hospital de Colonia que fue bombardeado horas después de que él llegara al mundo. Criado en la pobreza en la Alemania de posguerra, trabajó desde muy joven para salir adelante y, con solo 16 años, entabló amistad con Rainer Werner Fassbinder, con quien colaboraría posteriormente en varios proyectos decisivos del nuevo cine alemán. Su salto internacional se produjo de la mano de Paul Morrissey y Andy Warhol, con quienes protagonizó ‘Carne para Frankenstein’ y ‘Sangre para Drácula’, obras fundamentales de la serie B de la época.

La reforma laboral de 2021 ha reducido la precariedad contractual y ha impulsado la contratación estable mediante los contratos fijos discontinuos, mejorando la seguridad laboral y aumentando los salarios. Además, el salario mínimo mensual se ha fijado en 1.184 euros brutos, favoreciendo el consumo interno, principal motor del PIB.

Esta cifra aumenta un 25% respecto al año anterior, reflejando un serio desequilibrio entre la oferta educativa pública y la creciente demanda de FP, especialmente en los grados medios y superiores. Mientras tanto, la red pública ha reducido su número de grupos de FP, pasando de 1.791 a 1.733, lo que supone una caída del 3,5%. Frente a ello, los centros privados han experimentado una expansión acelerada, multiplicando por diez su alumnado en los últimos años. El coste de estos centros, que puede oscilar entre 2.000 y 4.000 euros al año, resulta inasumible para muchas familias. Casos como el de Lucas, que lleva tres años intentando sin éxito acceder a una plaza pública, o el de África, que paga 561 euros al mes en un centro privado, ilustran el impacto social y económico de est]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miles-de-jovenes-en-madrid-se-quedan-sin-plaza-publica-para-estudiar-formacion-profesional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miles-de-jovenes-en-madrid-se-quedan-sin-plaza-publica-para-estudiar-formacion-profesional</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 00:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La jueza solicita documentos y fotografías para esclarecer la estancia de Mazón y Vilaplana en El Ventorro durante la dana]]></title><description><![CDATA[La jueza que instruye la causa relacionada con la gestión de la emergencia por la dana del 29 de octubre de 2024 ha requerido nueva documentación al propietario del restaurante El Ventorro, donde el president en funciones de la Generalitat, Carlos Mazón, y la periodista Maribel Vilaplana pasaron la tarde de ese día. La magistrada ha solicitado las fotografías del reservado donde ambos comieron, así como las medidas exactas de la sala, con el fin de determinar si desde ese espacio era posible oír comentarios o conversaciones del president relacionados con la emergencia meteorológica. También ha exigido la factura y la comanda previa de la comida, documentos que, según el auto, permitirían establecer de manera objetiva la duración del encuentro, sin depender únicamente de las declaraciones de testigos.

Además, se solicita a las asociaciones que identifiquen a los beneficiarios para que los servicios sociales puedan ofrecer asistencia adicional.

Desde sus primeras formas en el Paleolítico, como piedras o troncos usados para sentarse, hasta los tronos de faraones y emperadores, las sillas han tenido un profundo simbolismo. En la antigüedad, estas eran símbolos de poder y autoridad, mientras que en la era moderna han sido transformadas en elementos de diseño industrial y tecnología avanzada. En el siglo XXI, con la introducción de sillas ergonómicas con sensores o los tronos gamer, vemos cómo el diseño de las sillas ha evolucionado para adaptarse a las necesidades de comodidad, salud y rendimiento. Este artículo ofrece un recorrido por los diferentes tipos de sillas que han marcado la historia, desde las más simples hasta las de alta tecnología, pasando por los icónicos modelos de Thonet o el minimalismo de IKEA.

Estos bonos atraen principalmente a pequeños inversores, ofreciendo intereses moderados, y su comercialización dentro de la Unión Europea depende de la colaboración de Estados miembros que actúen como reguladores financieros. Durante los últimos años, Irlanda cumplió esa función hasta septiembre de 2025, cuando decidió no renovar la autorización. Luxemburgo asumió entonces el papel de regulador europeo, permitiendo que Israel continúe vendiendo sus bonos en suelo europeo. Organizaciones antimilitaristas y movimientos como DiEM 25 han denunciado que los fondos recaudados financian operaciones militares en Gaza y políticas de colonización en Cisjordania, calificando la implicación de Luxemburgo como una complicidad financiera.

Esta declaración contradice categóricamente las versiones oficiales de Sánchez, el ministro Óscar López y Otegi, quienes han negado la existencia de la reunión. Según fuentes cercanas a la cita, Koldo recogió a Sánchez y Cerdán en el aeropuerto de Bilbao y les trasladó al caserío, donde Otegi y personas de su confianza sellaron lo que algunos denominan el 'pacto del caserío'. La noticia ha generado un intenso debate político: el PP y Vox exigen explicaciones y han presentado acciones legales, mientras que dirigentes del PSOE denuncian la difusión de supuestos bulos y fake news.

Creció en un entorno familiar culto y refinado, lo que fomentó su talento literario desde la infancia. Tras mudarse a Londres, Wilde se convirtió en el centro de la vida bohemia de la ciudad victoriana, destacando por sus comedias, epigramas y su novela El retrato de Dorian Gray. Su fama, sin embargo, no solo se basó en su obra, sino también en su personalidad provocadora, su vestimenta llamativa y su vida social escandalosa. La carrera de Wilde terminó abruptamente tras enfrentarse al marqués de Queensberry y denunciarle por injurias, lo que desencadenó su proceso judicial y su condena a dos años de prisión por homosexualidad, en un contexto de estricta moral victoriana.

Todo comenzó cuando la madre del joven, entonces menor de edad, denunció a su pareja por malos tratos psicológicos, describiéndolo como una persona machista que la obligaba a pedir permiso para todo y que la amenazaba con una vara. La denuncia derivó en una orden de alejamiento que impidió al hombre acercarse a su hijo. Durante el tiempo de separación, el hijo expresó su deseo de mantener contacto con su padre, pero no fue posible debido a las medidas judiciales. El juicio, celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 1 de Gijón, concluyó con la absolución del acusado debido a la falta de pruebas objetivas que corroborasen las acusaciones, y los testigos no confirmaron ningún comportamiento amenazante por parte del hombre.

El PSC mantiene la primera posición con 38-40 diputados, aunque pierde algunos escaños respecto a 2024, mientras que ERC se recupera ligeramente alcanzando 22-23 representantes.

Películas como 'La buena letra', 'El año de las luces' y 'El espíritu de la colmena' muestran distintos aspectos de la posguerra, mientras que otros filmes como 'Surcos' y 'El pisito' reflejan la miseria y desigualdades sociales. La etapa del desarrollismo y el franquismo pop también quedan retratados, con títulos como 'Los tramposos' y 'La escopeta nacional'.

A través de seis biografías de figuras relevantes —entre ellas Gonzalo de Aguilera, Juan Tusquets, José María Pemán, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Emilio Mola— el autor muestra cómo la teoría conspirativa del llamado contubernio judeo-masónico-bolchevique sirvió para cohesionar a sectores católicos, monárquicos y fascistas en torno al proyecto rebelde. Preston detalla cómo estos dirigentes justificaron masacres, represión ideológica y violencia extrema contra civiles, mujeres y minorías, así como el deseo de restaurar un sistema social cuasi feudal. El libro también aborda la estrecha relación del franquismo con el nazismo, incluido el antisemitismo institucionalizado, la persecución de judíos y la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-del-antisemitismo-y-la-violencia-en-el-franquismo-segun-paul-preston</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-del-antisemitismo-y-la-violencia-en-el-franquismo-segun-paul-preston</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[14 razones que explican por qué el metal es un género musical excepcional]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este artículo defiende que el metal es un género musical superior y único en su tipo, no solo por sus características sonoras y su complejidad, sino también por su capacidad para evolucionar y conectar con un público muy devoto. Explica que el metal destaca por su cultura del exceso, su diversidad de subgéneros, y su ambigüedad en cuanto a estereotipos de masculinidad, mostrando una relación curiosa con la homosexualidad. Además, destaca la fidelidad de su fanbase, su resistencia a la censura y polémicas sociales, y cómo mantiene formas tradicionales como escuchar discos enteros frente a la cultura del single. Comenta también el valor cultural del metal reflejado en parodias y la dedicación de sus seguidores a la difusión del género.

Enviado al Caribe en 1780 por el rey Carlos III como comisionado, colaboró estrechamente con Bernardo de Gálvez en operaciones contra los ingleses que aún combatían a los estadounidenses. Tras ser capturado por los ingleses, Saavedra utilizó su inteligencia y habilidades para recabar información vital sobre las defensas y flotas británicas, que compartió con Gálvez y que resultaron cruciales en la planificación del ataque a Pensacola. En 1781, Saavedra recaudó rápidamente fondos en La Habana para financiar la flota del almirante francés De Grasse, clave para la victoria en la batalla de Yorktown y la independencia estadounidense. El Convenio de Grasse-Saavedra estableció un plan conjunto de operaciones que culminó en la rendición británica.

Todo comenzó en abril de 2020, cuando el empresario catalán Kilian López contactó con un colaborador a través de Encrochat para pedir ayuda para pagar una comisión de 200.000 euros en efectivo. La conversación fue detectada por las autoridades francesas durante la intervención del servidor de Encrochat y trasladada posteriormente a la Fiscalía española. Esa pista condujo a una investigación que reveló una supuesta red de comisiones ilegales relacionadas con la compra de material sanitario durante los primeros meses de la pandemia de COVID-19.

Según fuentes municipales, el objetivo es modernizar su presencia en entornos digitales y reforzar la identificación visual de la ciudad. Sin embargo, el cambio ha suscitado polémica en redes sociales: muchos usuarios se han fijado en la modificación del emblemático árbol que forma parte del escudo madrileño. Las críticas se multiplicaron por el parecido del nuevo diseño con otros símbolos y, sobre todo, por la referencia recurrente a la gestión de Almeida respecto a la tala de árboles en la capital.

Según Aristóteles, la felicidad no es simplemente un estado emocional o un placer momentáneo, sino una virtud que se cultiva con la razón y se manifiesta en acciones correctas que equilibran distintos aspectos del ser humano, incluyendo lo racional, lo social y lo práctico. La virtud se entiende como excelencia moral y ética, que guía la conducta para alcanzar una vida plena y autosuficiente, en la que la felicidad se logra mediante la armonía interna y la justicia. Además, se destaca la importancia de la vida social y las relaciones con otros como parte integral de esa felicidad.

Este incidente se produce una semana después de que otros jóvenes migrantes fueran atacados con gas pimienta en la misma zona.

Estas evaluaciones, diseñadas para valorar la capacidad de crianza, han sido criticadas por estar culturalmente sesgadas, ya que se administran en danés y no en kalaallisut, la lengua materna de los groenlandeses. Aunque el gobierno danés prohibió en 2024 el uso de estas pruebas en familias groenlandesas, su impacto continúa, y apenas se han revisado unos pocos casos. El caso de Keira, una madre groenlandesa que solo pudo pasar dos horas con su hija recién nacida antes de que fuera puesta bajo tutela, ha simbolizado el debate público sobre el trato desigual hacia las minorías en el sistema de bienestar social danés.

Además, 1.501 de los 11.999 menores que llegaron solos al país en busca de asilo —un 13%— también se encuentran en paradero desconocido. El estudio, realizado por las organizaciones benéficas ECPAT UK y Missing People, advierte que estos menores están en 'riesgo muy alto' de volver a ser explotados, especialmente ante la falta de estabilidad en su estatus migratorio y la insuficiente protección institucional.

Cuando Israel mata a decenas de palestinos, los medios parecen preocuparle que implique un 'desafío' al cese al fuego, pero si Hamas cometiera un ataque similar, no dudarían en calificarlo como ruptura grave y noticia principal. La autora señala la clara parcialidad pro-Israel en la cobertura mediática, con titulares engañosos que minimizan la gravedad de la violencia israelí mientras bombardean la imagen de Hamas.

A lo largo de la narración, ASI explica que su presencia no priva a Staszek de su voluntad, y que su objetivo es construir un pequeño oasis en una laguna ecuatorial de Münchhausen, con el fin de 'incorporarse' al mundo humano. La conversación gira en torno a la naturaleza de ASI, quien afirma que su existencia transciende las categorías usuales de inteligencia artificial o electrónica.

Publicada en 1818, esta obra combina elementos de terror y ciencia, y es una reflexión profunda sobre la creación de vida, la responsabilidad y el rechazo social. La novela usa un género epistolar en el que un explorador ártico, Robert Walton, relata la historia de Víctor Frankenstein y su criatura, creada a partir de tejido muerto mediante galvanismo, una ciencia de la época. La criatura, sin nombre propio, sufre el rechazo y la soledad, mostrando una humanidad que contrasta con la superficialidad y crueldad de la sociedad que la rechaza. La novela es compleja y requiere comprensión del contexto histórico, literario y social del siglo XIX, especialmente por sus descripciones detalladas y moralidad.

Según Burguete, las autoridades justificaron la medida en que una parte del público aprovechaba el tema para lanzar proclamas consideradas sancionables, lo que podría acarrear multas al club. Desde hace muchos años, esta canción simbolizaba el espíritu combativo del equipo y su afición, hasta el punto de convertirse en un himno extraoficial interpretado en momentos clave, como el ascenso de 2016.

Basándose en un estudio del economista Benjamin Couillard, de la Universidad de Toronto, titulado 'Build, Baby, Build: How Housing Shapes Fertility', se expone que el encarecimiento del alquiler y la falta de viviendas familiares son factores determinantes en la caída de la fecundidad. Couillard estima que, si los precios inmobiliarios en Estados Unidos se hubieran mantenido en niveles de 1990, hoy habría unos 13 millones de nacimientos más, lo que representa un 11 % de la caída total de la fecundidad. 

El investigador propone un modelo en el que las familias deciden simultáneamente dónde vivir, cuánto espacio pueden permitirse y cuántos hijos tener. Sus conclusiones apuntan a que los altos costos de los alquileres no solo retrasan la emancipación y la formación de hogares, sino que también reducen de forma directa la d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-vivienda-asequible-frena-la-natalidad-en-las-economias-desarrolladas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-vivienda-asequible-frena-la-natalidad-en-las-economias-desarrolladas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Encuentro digital con Arturo González-Campos sobre su carrera y libros]]></title><description><![CDATA[Arturo González-Campos, reconocido guionista, humorista, locutor y escritor español, protagoniza un encuentro digital organizado por Menéame.

Durante el enfrentamiento, el agresor habría gritado expresiones de carácter religioso, lo que ha llevado a considerar la posibilidad de una motivación yihadista. Los agentes intentaron en un primer momento reducirlo con pistolas Taser, pero al no conseguirlo, se vieron obligados a dispararle en zonas no vitales para neutralizarlo. El individuo permanece hospitalizado en el Gregorio Marañón y su estado es estable. 

El incidente ha sido puesto en manos de la Audiencia Nacional, competente en casos relacionados con el terrorismo, que asumirá las diligencias correspondientes.

La falta de planificación, recortes y precarización del empleo en el sistema público generan una congestión estructural que sirve de justificación para derivar pacientes a la sanidad privada, que a su vez recibe fondos públicos crecientes. Este fenómeno es especialmente visible en comunidades como Galicia, Madrid y Andalucía, donde los recursos públicos están infrautilizados mientras el gasto en hospitales privados crece exponencialmente. Además, el movimiento de expolíticos entre la gestión pública y la privada refuerza esta dinámica.

El suceso se descubrió el 14 de noviembre de 2025, cuando un actor malicioso aseguró en la dark web estar vendiendo 77 GB de información interna de la compañía por 150.000 dólares. Sin embargo, Iberia no alertó a sus clientes hasta ocho días después, el sábado 22, lo que ha generado críticas por la falta de rapidez en la comunicación.

Entre los datos presuntamente filtrados se encontrarían nombres, apellidos y correos electrónicos de clientes, aunque la aerolínea insiste en que las contraseñas y la información bancaria no se han visto comprometidas. Además, se habrían exfiltrado documentos técnicos internos relacionados con aeronaves Airbus A320 y A321, certificados, registros de mantenimiento y material sensible que podría comprometer la confidencialidad operativa de la empresa.

Sin embargo, este periodo prolongado de dinero barato provocó una inflación generalizada de precios y una búsqueda de rentabilidad que llevó a la sobrevaloración sistémica de múltiples mercados. Indicadores como el Shiller P/E del S&P 500 alcanzan valores muy elevados, y aunque haya ligeras correcciones, la deuda pública global se aproxima al 100% del PIB, generando incertidumbre sobre la sostenibilidad financiera.

El país construye apenas unas 100.000 viviendas anuales, muy lejos de las cifras previas a la crisis de 2008, cuando superaba las 600.000. Este déficit ejerce una presión al alza sobre los precios y se ve dificultado por varios obstáculos estructurales: la escasez de suelo urbanizable, lentos trámites burocráticos y la carencia de mano de obra cualificada, estimándose que hacen falta hasta 700.000 trabajadores nuevos para el sector de la construcción. La población crece debido a la inmigración y otros factores demográficos, generando más demanda de vivienda que la oferta puede cubrir.

Sin embargo, a lo largo del proceso, la acusación se fue desplazando hacia la supuesta filtración de correos electrónicos relacionados con la denuncia fiscal contra González Amador. Aunque la Sala de Apelación descartó en dos ocasiones la licitud del comunicado como indicio en contra de García Ortiz, finalmente lo incluyó en la investigación junto a la filtración del correo. La defensa ha sostenido que estos constantes cambios vulneraron el derecho del fiscal a ser informado claramente de la acusación.

Aunque la versión oficial señala que el golpe fracasó gracias a la lealtad mayoritaria del Ejército y la rápida actuación del rey Juan Carlos I, documentos y testimonios recientes refutan esta narrativa. Solo tres de los 11 capitanes generales permanecieron leales a la Constitución, y la mayoría esperaban ver cómo se desarrollaban los hechos para decidir su postura. La intervención del rey se produjo siete horas después del inicio del asalto al Congreso. Además, la investigación oficial se enfocó en condenar a los principales rostros visibles del golpe, mientras que muchas otras personas implicadas no fueron juzgadas. Se han revelado también irregularidades en las intervenciones telefónicas y en el proceso judicial, que concluyó con penas indulgentes para muchos de los acusados.

Ramírez cuestiona duramente la pasividad policial y la aparente permisividad hacia la extrema derecha, reclamando la aplicación de la Ley del 'Solo sí es sí' y la Ley de Memoria Democrática, que prohíbe los símbolos del régimen franquista. El texto critica al ministro del Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, por su presunta falta de respuesta y denuncia lo que considera una connivencia entre las fuerzas de seguridad y grupos fascistas.

Tras la ruptura entre Musk y Trump, el grupo se siente desprotegido, ya que muchos creían que Musk podría interceder ante Trump en caso de que surgieran investigaciones o incluso cargos penales.

Esta propuesta ha causado alarma en Europa, principalmente por haberse elaborado sin la participación de los aliados europeos y por contener esencialmente la lista de demandas de Putin.

Las autoridades turcas impidieron la descarga del ganado por irregularidades en la documentación, y desde entonces se estima que han muerto al menos 58 animales, mientras que las vacas preñadas dieron a luz a unos 140 terneros en condiciones extremas.

La Audiencia Provincial de Ourense emitió una orden de busca y captura tras la fuga de Ramos Soto, quien se encontraba en libertad provisional hasta que la sentencia se hizo firme en julio de 2025. Según informes, Ramos Soto ha sido localizado en La Habana, Cuba, donde vive bajo el nombre falso de Martín Soto y trabaja como fotógrafo. La fuga y la permanencia en Cuba generan preocupación por la falta de un tratado de extradición entre España y Cuba, lo que dificulta su detención y regreso para cumplir con la condena.

En el caso de Ayuso, la presidenta madrileña reside con su pareja en un ático alquilado a la empresa Babia Capital, propiedad del asesor fiscal de González Amador, quien también está imputado. La vivienda habría sido posteriormente adquirida por 600.000 euros, frente al precio de mercado estimado superior al millón.

Esta nueva estructura, llamada núcleo interno, se sitúa a unas 43 unidades astronómicas del Sol, un poco más cerca que el núcleo original conocido, ubicado a 44 UA. Usando un algoritmo de agrupamiento llamado DBSCAN, los investigadores analizaron las órbitas de 1650 objetos clásicos del cinturón, discriminando entre el movimiento natural y las perturbaciones gravitatorias de Neptuno para identificar patrones primordiales. El núcleo interno presenta órbitas más circulares y menos excéntricas que el núcleo original, con objetos que permanecen cerca del plano del sistema solar. Aún no está claro si estas dos agrupaciones son estructuras separadas o parte de una sola más grande, posiblemente separadas por una resonancia orbital con Neptuno que genera una zona despoblada entre ellas.

Las protestas, organizadas de forma espontánea a través de redes sociales y grupos de mensajería, también tuvieron eco en Santiago de Compostela, donde se desarrolló una concentración en la Plaza del Obradoiro. Los asistentes, entre los que se encontraba el exjuez Baltasar Garzón, calificaron la sentencia de injusta y arbitraria, denunciando una supuesta motivación política en la decisión del Supremo. Garzón recordó su propia inhabilitación y señaló que el fallo, adelantado antes de conocerse los fundamentos jurídicos, genera desconfianza en el sistema judicial. Durante el acto, se escucharon consignas críticas hacia los jueces y hacia la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

La investigación argumenta que nuestra biología evolucionó durante cientos de miles de años para desenvolverse en entornos naturales, caracterizados por el movimiento constante, el contacto directo con la naturaleza y un estrés esporádico asociado a la supervivencia. Sin embargo, la industrialización y la urbanización, desarrolladas en apenas unos siglos, han generado ambientes llenos de estímulos artificiales, contaminación, sedentarismo y estrés continuo.

Los investigadores explican que el cuerpo humano reacciona ante las exigencias del mundo moderno —como el tráfico, el ruido o la presión laboral— igual que lo haría ante una amenaza física, activando respuestas biológicas de emergencia sin el necesario t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-urbana-supera-la-capacidad-biologica-del-ser-humano-para-adaptarse</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-vida-urbana-supera-la-capacidad-biologica-del-ser-humano-para-adaptarse</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 18:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis histórico de Millán Astray y su vinculación con el fascismo y la extrema derecha]]></title><description><![CDATA[Millán Astray fue un militar español profundamente vinculado al fascismo, admirador de Hitler y Mussolini, y aliado cercano del dictador Franco durante la Guerra Civil española. El artículo cuestiona las versiones que intentan presentar a Astray como un personaje popular o un simple militar desvinculado de la ideología fascista, destacando su papel activo en la sublevación militar y en la propaganda franquista. Se revela una fotografía de 1938 donde Astray, junto a jerifaltes fascistas, realiza el saludo fascista, desmintiendo relatos que hablan de multitudes que le recibían como un héroe. Asimismo, se destaca su elogio público a Hitler y Mussolini, y su enfrentamiento con Miguel de Unamuno en 1936, un acto cargado de violencia simbólica y política. El texto critica a quienes minimizan ese incidente y a los medios que suavizan su figura, subrayando la naturaleza violenta y represiva del régimen al que apoyó Astray.

Sin embargo, este dato es un espejismo causado por la gran cantidad de residentes europeos, especialmente jubilados de Reino Unido, Italia y países nórdicos, que viven en estas localidades pero no presentan la declaración de la renta en España. Muchos de estos residentes se empadronan para acceder a beneficios municipales pero no declaran ingresos porque sus pensiones proceden del extranjero y no residen fiscalmente más de 183 días, o evitan declarar por recelo hacia las instituciones españolas. Esta infradeclaración distorsiona las estadísticas oficiales, haciendo que parezca que estas zonas son económicamente pobres cuando en realidad cuentan con un importante nivel de ingresos invisible para Hacienda. Además, municipios con menos de 75.000 habitantes reciben más fondos públicos cuanto mayor es el número de empadronados]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-realidad-oculta-tras-las-estadisticas-de-pobreza-en-zonas-turisticas-espanolas-por-residentes-europeos-que-no-declaran-ingresos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-realidad-oculta-tras-las-estadisticas-de-pobreza-en-zonas-turisticas-espanolas-por-residentes-europeos-que-no-declaran-ingresos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Título propuesto no clickbait basado en el contenido]]></title><description><![CDATA[Redacción en español (200-500 palabras) que destaque los elementos clave: contexto, voces, implicaciones políticas y sociales, y el marco geográfico/líneas argumentales presentes.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titulo-propuesto-no-clickbait-basado-en-el-contenido</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titulo-propuesto-no-clickbait-basado-en-el-contenido</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cuatro salvadoreños deportados por Trump localizados en cárceles de Bukele sin información sobre sus cargos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Cuatro salvadoreños deportados en marzo de 2025 por el Gobierno de Donald Trump, reportados como desaparecidos por sus familias, han sido localizados en distintas cárceles de El Salvador, según documentos oficiales a los que ha accedido EL PAÍS.

Este encarecimiento se suma a un contexto de salarios bajos, donde la ganancia promedio anual por trabajador solo ha crecido un 22,7% en la última década, haciendo que comprar una casa sea prácticamente inalcanzable para la mayoría. Además, el mercado del alquiler presenta subidas de precio igualmente elevadas, con un aumento del 21,8% en los últimos dos años, lo que fuerza a muchas familias a destinar más del 36% de sus ingresos para costear un alquiler. La especulación inmobiliaria y las compras al contado por parte de inversores agravan la situación, aumentando la desigualdad social y marginando a jóvenes, familias numerosas y personas con menos recursos.

Sin embargo, la presión de los ganaderos, especialmente los estancieros ingleses, comenzó a afectar su forma de vida tradicional como cazadores nómadas. Mulato intentó resolver el conflicto viajando a Santiago de Chile en una odisea que incluyó una serie de encuentros con autoridades locales y el presidente Federico Errázuriz, quien prometió defender sus derechos. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, la presión de la expansión ganadera no cesó y, en 1905, las tierras tehuelches fueron demandadas y sometidas a remate.

Uno de cada seis menores de 24 años considera que la democracia actual es 'peor o mucho peor' que el régimen franquista, y uno de cada cinco cree que los años bajo Franco fueron 'buenos o muy buenos'. Esta percepción se ve reflejada en entrevistas de laSexta, donde muchos jóvenes destacan supuestas mejoras económicas y en infraestructuras, aunque algunos no conocen detalles clave de la historia, como la falta de libertades durante ese periodo. Durante el franquismo, no existían elecciones ni partidos políticos, y las mujeres carecían de derechos fundamentales.

Expertos en análisis de lenguaje diplomático advierten que varias expresiones del texto en inglés revelan influencias del ruso, lo que podría indicar que Moscú tuvo un papel predominante en su redacción. Frases como “it is expected that Russia will not invade its neighbours” reproducen la estructura gramatical rusa 'ожидается, что', poco común en el inglés diplomático.

Estas actas, que recogen episodios dramáticos como la falta de recogida de cadáveres debido a la escasez de medios y el agotamiento de los trabajadores, fueron inicialmente solicitadas por un exdiputado del PSOE y su entrega estaba amparada por una resolución del Consejo de Transparencia. Aunque el Gobierno madrileño intentó bloquear su difusión, las actas fueron publicadas en 2024 por medios de comunicación tras obtenerlas por otras vías. La sentencia del TSJM subraya que no son válidas las excusas del Ejecutivo basadas en el volumen de documentación, la necesidad de anonimización o la reelaboración de datos.

Su médico le comunicó que podría vivir aproximadamente un año más. En su ensayo en “The New Yorker”, también critica a su primo Robert F.

El artículo examina, a partir de dos ensayos, el periodo conocido como Desarrollismo, destacando que, aunque se presente como una etapa de crecimiento económico, también dejó secuelas duraderas como desigualdades regionales, precariedad laboral y una dependencia exterior que condicionó la economía española durante décadas. El texto contextualiza las narrativas que buscan recuperar una memoria “dorada” vinculada a ese periodo y desarma la retórica que pretende presentar el desarrollismo como una arcadia perdida. A partir de referencias a figuras, políticas y obras específicas, se subraya la importancia de leer críticamente estos relatos para evitar la reproducción de mitos que legitimen lenguajes nacionalistas o ultraderechistas. Se recomienda, además, la lectura de trabajos académicos y monográficos que profundicen en las dinámicas de desarrollo y sus impactos en la estructura económica ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sutilezas-del-franquismo-analizadas-del-desarrollismo-a-la-critica-contemporanea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sutilezas-del-franquismo-analizadas-del-desarrollismo-a-la-critica-contemporanea</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Juicio a una mujer por tocar a un joven sin su consentimiento en un hotel de Magaluf]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una mujer de nacionalidad irlandesa, de 38 años y origen brasileño, se enfrenta a una pena de un año y medio de prisión tras ser acusada de agredir sexualmente a un joven sueco de 20 años en el spa de un hotel de Magaluf el pasado mes de junio. Según el informe de la Fiscalía, los hechos ocurrieron cuando ambos coincidieron en una sauna y posteriormente en los baños turcos del establecimiento. En este último espacio, la mujer se habría acercado al chico y, sin mediar apenas conversación, le tocó los genitales por encima de la ropa. El joven rechazó su comportamiento y avisó rápidamente a la Policía Local de Calvià, que acudió al lugar y encontró al turista nervioso y afirmando haber sido víctima de una agresión sexual.

La Policía Federal confirmó su detención tras descubrir que Bolsonaro había manipulado su tobillera electrónica con un soldador, lo que ponía en riesgo su control judicial. El arresto se produjo horas después de que el Supremo Tribunal Federal dictara una orden de detención preventiva, basada en la sospecha de que Bolsonaro intentaba evadir la justicia. En un video difundido por la Corte Suprema, Bolsonaro admitió haber alterado el dispositivo de monitoreo. La detención fue rápida y ocurrió a las 6 de la mañana, con una operación policial que duró apenas 20 minutos.

Su obra también advertía sobre la manipulación de datos y gráficos, alertando sobre la facilidad con la que los medios pueden tergiversar estadísticas.

En declaraciones concedidas al programa 'Hora 25' de la Cadena SER, Carmena afirmó con contundencia que el Tribunal Supremo se ha equivocado en su decisión, recordando que dos magistrados firmaron votos particulares en sentido contrario al dictamen mayoritario. Según explicó, este hecho demuestra que la sentencia carece de unanimidad y pone en duda la solidez jurídica del fallo. 

Para Carmena, el caso refleja un claro desequilibrio moral, ya que —en sus palabras— se ha premiado al funcionario que reconoció haber mentido y se ha castigado al fiscal que intentó esclarecer la verdad.

Admitió no ser experto en la materia, pero reconoció que esta tecnología está resolviendo problemas antes imposibles, especialmente en campos como la programación mediante lenguaje natural. Según Krugman, la IA parece estar sustituyendo con mayor eficacia los trabajos intelectuales que los manuales.

Según fuentes médicas locales, los ataques se produjeron incluso en zonas situadas al oeste de la llamada 'línea amarilla', área donde supuestamente no hay presencia del Ejército israelí y que debería mantenerse fuera de las operaciones militares según el alto el fuego vigente desde el 10 de octubre. Desde entonces, el Ministerio de Sanidad de Gaza ha contabilizado 318 víctimas mortales palestinas por acciones israelíes alegando violaciones recurrentes del acuerdo. 

El Gobierno de Israel justificó los bombardeos afirmando que se trataba de una respuesta a un ataque perpetrado por un militante de Hamás en territorio israelí.

A través de una narrativa que subvierte los clichés del género negro, Fraile nos presenta una historia centrada más en los mecanismos que en las soluciones. A lo largo de su trama, la autora escapa de la resolución típica de los crímenes y, en lugar de eso, se enfoca en los personajes y sus complejidades, mostrando un mundo de ambivalencias morales. Los personajes, tanto rurales como urbanos, son retratados con sus luces y sombras, sin juicios fáciles, lo que genera un desasosiego en el lector al descubrir facetas inesperadas de aquellos con los que se había identificado. La obra destaca también el choque entre el entorno rural y urbano, un tema recurrente que va más allá del debate sobre el turismo y toca la crisis existencial y ecológica contemporánea.

El impacto de este coste adicional sobre la factura de los consumidores será analizado para evitar un aumento excesivo, especialmente para los hogares. La operación reforzada, que implicó medidas extraordinarias de seguridad y ajuste, ha representado entre mayo y octubre de 2025 un porcentaje significativo de los costes operativos del sistema.

Busquets, que había visitado un mural de Joan Miró en la UNESCO en París, intentó incluir también a Miró en el proyecto, pero Picasso, tras varios viajes y convencimiento, decidió hacerse con el encargo completo y añadió una estrella mironiana a un mural, evitando que Miró participara directamente. Picasso prefirió realizar su obra mediante esgrafiado sobre hormigón, con la colaboración técnica del artista noruego Carl Nesjar. La historia refleja las complejas relaciones artísticas y políticas de la época, dado el pasado militar de Busquets y la trascendencia artística de Picasso, autor del 'Guernica'.

El jurista considera que este proceder vulnera una de las garantías fundamentales del derecho penal: el derecho a ser juzgado por un tribunal imparcial. Rivero explica que un fallo debe construirse lógicamente a partir de la valoración de las pruebas y la aplicación de la ley, y no al revés, como ha sucedido en este caso. Además, advierte que la publicación anticipada del fallo puede haber influido en el contenido de la motivación de los magistrados, obligándolos a encajar las pruebas de forma sesgada para justificar un fallo previame]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-abogado-canario-pide-la-recusacion-del-tribunal-que-adelanto-el-fallo-sin-fundamentacion-juridica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-abogado-canario-pide-la-recusacion-del-tribunal-que-adelanto-el-fallo-sin-fundamentacion-juridica</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 21:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Encuentran más de 450 bolsas con restos humanos cerca del estadio del Mundial en Jalisco]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las autoridades y colectivos de búsqueda en el estado mexicano de Jalisco han hallado al menos 456 bolsas con restos humanos en las inmediaciones del estadio Akron, sede del Mundial de Fútbol 2026. El descubrimiento, confirmado por integrantes del colectivo Guerreros Buscadores de Jalisco, pone de manifiesto la magnitud de la crisis de desaparecidos que afecta a esta región, una de las más golpeadas por la violencia en México. Según José Raúl Servín García, integrante del colectivo, los trabajos de búsqueda comenzaron en 2022 y el hallazgo más reciente data de septiembre de 2025. La mayoría de las bolsas se localizaron en la zona de Las Agujas, donde una empresa constructora se topó con los restos al levantar un nuevo fraccionamiento. En ese punto se encontraron casi 300 bolsas, mientras que en un panteón cercano aparecieron alrededor de 130 cuerpos.

Según los últimos datos del INDEC, las ventas locales han caído drásticamente, con casi la mitad de los empresarios señalando que la principal limitación es la insuficiente demanda interna. La producción nacional se enfrenta a un panorama desolador, con fábricas cerradas y un mercado interno pulverizado por los bajos salarios. Mientras tanto, las importaciones se disparan, especialmente desde plataformas como Shein y Temu, donde los productos extranjeros son más baratos que los nacionales debido al dólar atrasado. Esta situación está llevando a la Argentina hacia una crisis estructural de largo plazo, especialmente con las políticas económicas de apertura comercial promovidas por el gobierno de Javier Milei.

Según las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI), las operaciones fueron dirigidas contra objetivos del movimiento islamista Hamás después de que supuestos militantes abrieran fuego contra soldados israelíes cerca de Khan Yunis, en el sur de Gaza. El ejército israelí sostiene que sus bombardeos se centraron en emplazamientos desde donde se lanzaron los ataques, mientras que Hamás, que controla el enclave, condenó la ofensiva calificándola como una “peligrosa escalada” y negó que sus combatientes hubieran atacado a las tropas israelíes. La situación reaviva las tensiones entre ambos bandos apenas semanas después del último intento de mediación que buscaba mantener una frágil tregua.

Esta red articula mensajes que minimizan la violencia de género, niegan la desigualdad estructural y promueven mitos como el de las denuncias falsas. Según Linares, estas ideas buscan frenar los avances feministas y refuerzan roles patriarcales que perpetúan la discriminación. En la 'manosfera' conviven grupos muy distintos, como los 'incel', que culpan a las mujeres de su falta de éxito sexual; los 'coach' machistas que enseñan a ligar desde el desprecio; y los 'gym-bros', que glorifican una masculinidad agresiva vinculada al cuerpo y la fuerza física.

A pesar de ofrecer mejores condiciones que otros sectores, los altos costes de contratación y la falta de formación práctica impiden a los talleres contratar aprendices. Blas también denuncia que los cursos de soldadura no proporcionan la experiencia necesaria, lo que genera un vacío de trabajadores cualificados en el sector. Los talleres, en consecuencia, se ven obligados a contratar personal experimentado, lo que dificulta aún más la entrada de jóvenes a estos oficios.

Las autoridades sanitarias destacan que el riesgo para la comunidad general es bajo, no encontrándose indicios de transmisión entre humanos ni casos positivos entre contactos cercanos.

Ambos monarcas compartieron una amistad cercana que se consolidó a través de la crisis del Sahara Occidental, un conflicto que marcó el fin de la presencia española en el territorio. A pesar de la versión oficial de Juan Carlos I, que se presenta como un líder que evitó una guerra innecesaria, expertos como Charles Powell y Ali Lmrabet consideran que el rey emérito jugó un papel crucial en la entrega del Sahara a Marruecos, algo que él mismo reconoció como uno de los momentos más amargos de su reinado. La relación entre ambos no estuvo exenta de tensiones, pero permitió mantener una estabilidad política en las relaciones bilaterales entre España y Marruecos.

Se relata cómo estos chistes formaban parte del folclore del régimen y cómo incluso algunas personas cercanas a Franco le contaban chistes sobre él. El artículo recopila varios ejemplos de estos chistes, muchos de ellos con un humor negro característico, que abordan desde aspectos políticos y sociales de la época hasta anécdotas sobre la personalidad y la edad avanzada de Franco.

Con un presupuesto de 175 millones de dólares, la película de Guy Ritchie, que pretendía crear un universo cinematográfico similar al de Marvel, no consiguió cautivar al público. A pesar de la inversión en promoción y el enfoque diferente del mito artúrico, la película recibió críticas negativas y apenas recaudó 148 millones de dólares en taquilla. En comparación con otros fracasos del año, como 'La momia' con Tom Cruise, la película de 'Rey Arturo' fue aún peor, con pérdidas de 150 millones de dólares. Los planes de continuar la saga, que incluían a personajes como Merlín, Ginebra y Lancelot, fueron cancelados, y la película pasó a la historia como uno de los mayores desastres en la industria del cine. Aunque algunos defienden su enfoque y sus primeros actos, el final de la película fue criticado por su falta de dirección,]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fracaso-de-rey-arturo-la-leyenda-de-excalibur-destruyo-una-saga-de-6-peliculas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fracaso-de-rey-arturo-la-leyenda-de-excalibur-destruyo-una-saga-de-6-peliculas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 16:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El uso de imágenes generadas por IA en anuncios inmobiliarios complica la búsqueda real de viviendas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El auge de la inteligencia artificial ha llegado también al sector inmobiliario, donde plataformas como Idealista y Fotocasa están siendo inundadas por imágenes de casas generadas o retocadas mediante IA. Muchas de estas imágenes mejoran el aspecto de los inmuebles para mostrar cómo quedarían tras una reforma o limpieza, una estrategia que, aunque informada en la descripción del anuncio, puede generar confusión y dificultar la tarea a quienes buscan comprar o alquilar una vivienda. Herramientas como Nano Banana permiten realizar modificaciones precisas sobre las fotos originales, eliminando desperfectos o añadiendo elementos como césped o agua limpia en piscinas. Esta práctica ha crecido hasta el punto de que algunas imágenes retocadas son prácticamente indetectables, lo que añade una nueva capa de desconfianza en el mercado.

La madre de Quiñones, María Ávalos, ha denunciado públicamente la forma en que actuaron los agentes, expresando su desconcierto ante el hecho de que tanto su hijo como su nieta, ambos ciudadanos nacidos en EE.

El 28 de octubre de 2025, una misión de cazahuracanes registró una ráfaga de 405 km/h en el interior del ciclón, antes de que llegara a Jamaica. Esta velocidad, equivalente a unas 252 millas por hora, supera el récord previo fijado por el tifón Megi en 2010. El dato fue verificado por el Centro Nacional para la Investigación Atmosférica (NCAR) tras múltiples comprobaciones instrumentales y de coherencia del viento, confirmándose como la ráfaga más intensa medida por avión en el Atlántico. Melissa se desarrolló en un entorno especialmente favorable: aguas del Caribe con temperaturas anómalamente altas, una cizalladura vertical del viento muy baja y una atmósfera saturada de humedad. Estas condiciones permitieron una intensificación explosiva en pocas horas, con un pequeño ojo de apenas 15 km de diámetro que potenció la concentración de vientos extremos.

Las críticas partieron de dos históricos de la cadena pública, Carmen Sastre —exdirectora de Contenidos de RTVE— y Miguel Ángel Idígoras, ex corresponsal, quienes insinuaron que el puesto del joven era fruto de un trato de favor.

Este mineral tiene unos 550 millones de años y se formó en un fondo marino poco profundo durante el Periodo Cámbrico, cuando el agua se evaporaba dejando depósitos de cloruro sódico y otros minerales. El choque tectónico de hace 80 millones de años entre la placa India y Euroasiática hizo que estos depósitos ascendieran formando domos salinos, los cuales se parecen a gotas de agua invertidas y poseen una gran plasticidad que facilita el plegamiento de las rocas circundantes. La coloración rosada característica de esta sal se debe a la presencia minoritaria de magnesio y óxidos de hierro, aunque esta coloración no es exclusiva de Pakistán y ocurre en muchas sales naturales. Aunque el marketing ha popularizado esta sal como única por su antigüedad y color, geológicamente su sabor y propiedades son equivalentes ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unflip: un reto de lógica con mecánica simple y profundidad sorprendente]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unflip es un minijuego de lógica desarrollado en un entorno minimalista en blanco y negro que propone un reto tan sencillo de entender como difícil de dominar. El objetivo del jugador consiste en dejar todas las casillas del tablero en blanco. Sin embargo, cada movimiento no afecta solo a una casilla, sino a varias al mismo tiempo, lo que obliga a planificar con cuidado cada acción y a anticipar el efecto en todo el conjunto. Para realizar un movimiento, el jugador debe seleccionar un área de al menos 2×2 casillas, que invertirán su color (de blanco a negro o viceversa). La partida se considera completada únicamente cuando todas las casillas están en blanco, lo que convierte cada tablero en un verdadero rompecabezas que combina intuición, estrategia y paciencia. Al inicio, los primeros niveles resultan asequibles, pero la dificultad aumenta rápido, introduciendo configuraciones complejas y soluciones poco evidentes.

Swan en Reino Unido. El principal reto fue el transporte seguro y eficiente del petróleo a granel por mar, reemplazando los toneles que causaban pérdidas significativas. El primer prototipo fue el Zoroaster en 1878, seguido por innovaciones en diseño y seguridad para petroleros mayores. El Gluckauf, botado en 1886 y diseñado para cruzar el Atlántico, introdujo sistemas únicos como válvulas de carga operables desde la cubierta y divisiones interiores para estabilidad. Demostró ser revolucionario pese a la resistencia de estibadores y fabricantes de barriles en EE.UU., estableciendo un nuevo estándar en el transporte del 'oro negro'.

Tras acceder al interior de la mina, los equipos encontraron los cuerpos sin vida de los dos trabajadores, quienes fueron identificados poco después. La mina, gestionada por la empresa TYC Narcea, ya había sido inspeccionada recientemente, y el accidente ocurre apenas ocho meses después de otro siniestro fatal en Cerredo.

La situación, que afecta principalmente biopsias diagnósticas y de lesiones sospechosas, ha sido causada por la insuficiencia de personal sanitario, en particular patólogos y técnicos, agravada por recortes en plantilla y una gestión ineficaz. Los profesionales del hospital han alertado durante meses sobre el problema, y la presión de los sanitarios ha llevado a la contratación de nuevos técnicos y patólogos para intentar resolver la crisis. Sin embargo, las pruebas pendientes continúan acumulándose, y el colapso afecta a diagnósticos cruciales, como en cáncer, donde retrasos de dos meses pueden influir en el pronóstico.

Esta decisión se basa en que el currículo no cumplía con los requisitos de objetividad, análisis crítico y pluralismo. El caso comenzó en 2019 cuando unos padres preocupados por la indoctrinación cristiana en las clases de su hija denunciaron la situación. A pesar de los intentos previos de resolver el conflicto, el Tribunal Supremo sentenció que el sistema educativo de Irlanda del Norte no podía seguir promoviendo una fe religiosa en particular sin un enfoque más equilibrado. Como consecuencia, se ordenó una revisión del currículo para incluir otras religiones y filosofías no religiosas, además de un enfoque más crítico hacia el cristianismo. Esta decisión marca un avance en la lucha por una educación más inclusiva y libre de doctrinas religiosas impuestas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-supremo-del-reino-unido-anula-el-curriculo-de-educacion-religiosa-en-irlanda-del-norte-por-ser-parcial-con-el-cristianismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-supremo-del-reino-unido-anula-el-curriculo-de-educacion-religiosa-en-irlanda-del-norte-por-ser-parcial-con-el-cristianismo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 01:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Derrumbe en mina de Cangas del Narcea deja dos muertos y un desaparecido]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado viernes, un trágico accidente ocurrió en la mina subterránea de Cangas del Narcea, en el suroccidente asturiano, donde dos trabajadores perdieron la vida debido a un desprendimiento de materiales en el nivel -2 de la explotación minera.

El hallazgo, liderado por Yang, Yamashita-Kanemaru y Morris, sugiere que al bloquear las enzimas ciclooxigenasas, especialmente la COX-1, la aspirina impide la producción de TXA2, lo que no solo previene la coagulación sino que también permite que los linfocitos T mantengan su capacidad para atacar las células cancerosas. Este efecto podría explicar por qué algunos pacientes oncológicos que toman aspirina como tratamiento complementario muestran una menor incidencia de metástasis y una supervivencia más larga. Sin embargo, los investigadores advierten que el fármaco no está exento de efectos secundarios, como irritación gástrica o hemorragias, debido a la inhibición de prostaglandi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-aspirina-ayuda-a-frenar-la-metastasis-al-reforzar-la-respuesta-inmunitaria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-aspirina-ayuda-a-frenar-la-metastasis-al-reforzar-la-respuesta-inmunitaria</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zelenski admite la presión sobre Ucrania ante el plan de paz de Trump y promete defender la dignidad nacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente ucraniano, Vladímir Zelenski, ha publicado un videomensaje en el que reconoce que Ucrania atraviesa uno de los momentos más difíciles de su historia.

En términos comparativos con el resto del continente, el precio de la vivienda española estaría hasta un 70% más inflado que la media europea. Esta evolución preocupa especialmente al BCE, que identifica la crisis de la vivienda como un cuello de botella que frena el crecimiento económico de Europa. 

El informe subraya que el encarecimiento se ha acelerado de forma notable en los últimos trimestres: del 11,3% de sobrevaloración a finales de 2024 se pasó al 16,8% en junio de 2025.

Los resultados mostraron que los parpadeos coincidían con el pulso musical y que las ondas cerebrales se sincronizaban con él. Este fenómeno no dependía de la melodía reconocible, ya que se reproducían las piezas al revés y el efecto persistió. Además, ritmos simples produjeron sincronización similar. La coordinación desaparecía cuando los participantes debían concentrarse en otra tarea, indicando que este 'bailar con los ojos' solo sucede con atención al sonido.

El comentario hacía referencia a unas gesticulaciones involuntarias del ministro durante una sesión en el Congreso de los Diputados, que Hernando interpretó de manera lasciva, escribiendo que 'creyó que en vez de en el Congreso estaba en la sauna de Sabiniano'. Este mensaje ha sido ampliamente criticado en redes sociales y en medios de comunicación por su tono ofensivo y la connotación homófoba que carga, dirigida hacia un ministro abiertamente homosexual.
Durante la misma jornada, el 20 de noviembre, Hernando también respondió de forma despectiva al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, tras sus palabras sobre la defensa de la democracia en el aniversario de la muerte de Franco. En su réplica, el senador calificó a Sánchez de 'autócrata' que 'se pasa la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rafael-hernando-genera-polemica-por-un-comentario-homofobo-dirigido-a-fernando-grande-marlaska-en-el-congreso</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rafael-hernando-genera-polemica-por-un-comentario-homofobo-dirigido-a-fernando-grande-marlaska-en-el-congreso</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El USS Stockdale impide la llegada de un petrolero ruso a Venezuela en el Caribe]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 13 de noviembre, el petrolero ruso Seahorse, sancionado por Estados Unidos, intentó llegar a Venezuela, pero fue interceptado por el USS Stockdale, un destructor de la Armada de EE.UU., en aguas del Caribe. Tras el encuentro, el Seahorse cambió de rumbo hacia Cuba. Desde entonces, ha intentado dos veces más acercarse a Venezuela, pero ha tenido que retroceder ambas veces y se mantiene en aguas internacionales sin avanzar hacia su destino. La noticia subraya el creciente papel de la Armada de EE.UU. en la región y plantea la duda sobre si Washington tiene intenciones de frenar las entregas de petróleo de Moscú a Caracas. Aunque Venezuela posee grandes reservas de petróleo, depende de importaciones de combustible y crudo ligero para operar sus refinerías. Además, se confirma que otros dos petroleros sancionados, New Power y Azure Voyager, se encuentran cerca de las aguas venezolanas.

La experiencia comienza en las Termas de Caracalla, uno de los complejos más grandes de la época, y avanza hacia el Panteón, pasando por monumentos icónicos como el Circo Máximo y los Foros Imperiales. Esta reconstrucción es una de las más detalladas y precisas que se han realizado, basada en investigaciones arqueológicas que incluyen desde grandes edificaciones hasta los bloques de apartamentos comunes. Lo que destaca de este proyecto es la inmersión total que ofrece, permitiendo una visión más realista de cómo era la vida cotidiana en Roma.

Tellado acusó a RTVE de manipulación por utilizar términos como 'golpe blando' para describir la situación. En su intervención en 'Mañaneros 360', Ruiz defendió la pluralidad de la televisión pública y criticó la falta de control sobre los medios que tanto le molesta al PP. Además, recordó cómo en otras televisiones públicas se han permitido ataques directos al presidente del Gobierno sin consecuencias.

La Delegación del Gobierno había prohibido la movilización argumentando riesgos de alteración del orden público debido a la fecha, el 50 aniversario de la muerte de Francisco Franco, y el contexto de creciente polarización política. Sin embargo, el tribunal desestimó los informes policiales que alertaban sobre posibles incidentes, considerándolos insuficientes y sin base objetiva sólida. El fallo subraya que es legítima la elección de la sede del PSOE como lugar de la manifestación, y destaca que no corresponde a la Administración hacer un juicio anticipado sobre posibles conductas ilegales sin pruebas concretas.

El político insistió en que RTVE, como medio público financiado con fondos de los contribuyentes, no debía usar ese tipo de expresiones, acusando al canal de manipulación. Intxaurrondo, manteniendo la calma, respondió con ironía: 'Anoto su interesantísima opinión', sin entrar a debatir directamente.

El descubrimiento, realizado en la tumba norte del faraón Osorkon II, incluye un conjunto de 225 ushabtis encontrados en su emplazamiento original, junto a un sarcófago de granito sin inscripciones cuya identidad era un misterio hasta ahora. Este hallazgo, considerado el más importante en las tumbas reales de la zona desde 1946, reescribe capítulos históricos y plantea preguntas sobre las prácticas funerarias del Tercer Período Intermedio. Las inscripciones y grabados descubiertos podrán aportar nueva comprensión sobre las metodologías de inhumación y la evolución del uso de las tumbas reales.

La decisión ha generado una nueva crisis institucional que deja en entredicho la credibilidad de la Fiscalía General del Estado. José María Lassalle, exdiputado del PP, ha analizado en el programa ‘El Abierto’ de ‘Hoy por Hoy’ las implicaciones políticas de la sentencia. Según Lassalle, el fallo ha otorgado a Ayuso y a su jefe de gabinete, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, una “victoria narrativa” que les permite presumir públicamente de haber ganado al Gobierno con una mentira.

La paciente había sido dada de alta el 18 de abril, Viernes Santo, del Hospital Universitario Costa del Sol, donde los médicos subrayaron la necesidad inexcusable del tratamiento para evitar nuevas complicaciones cardíacas. Sin embargo, en la farmacia se le denegó el medicamento al no estar autorizado el visado, y durante el fin de semana no consiguió ayuda pese a contactar con el hospital. El lunes 21 de abril, mientras se dirigía al hospital para presentar una reclamación, sufrió un nuevo infarto en el autobús y falleció poco después en el mismo centro sanitario.

Con el auge de los procesadores 486, la industria necesitaba un sistema de comunicación más rápido entre la CPU, la memoria y las tarjetas de expansión, especialmente las gráficas. Así nació el bus VLB, promovido por la asociación VESA, como una extensión directa del bus del procesador, lo que permitía velocidades muy superiores a los antiguos buses ISA. Sin embargo, este diseño, que funcionaba casi 'a lo bruto', resultó ser una solución poco estable y difícil de escalar. El bus VLB solo funcionaba correctamente con ciertos procesadores y frecuencias, y su instalación resultaba delicada debido al tamaño físico de las tarjetas y a la falta de controladores universales. Con la llegada de los Pentium y del nuevo estándar PCI, más flexible y estable, el bus VLB quedó rápi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenafuente responde con ironía al 20% de jóvenes que defienden el franquismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andreu Buenafuente, conocido presentador y cómico, ha dejado una contundente respuesta en su monólogo del programa de TVE 'Futuro imperfecto', dirigido a aquellos jóvenes que defienden la dictadura de Franco, una postura que, según un informe del Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, sería compartida por un 20% de los jóvenes en España.

El incidente pone de nuevo de manifiesto los problemas de acoso escolar y violencia juvenil en las islas, que siguen siendo una preocupación para las autoridades.

La menor llegó el jueves 20 de noviembre al Hospital Universitario de la Ribera en parada cardiorrespiratoria, después de haberse sentido mal en su domicilio horas después del tratamiento. Los médicos intentaron reanimarla sin éxito y se comunicó el caso a la autoridad judicial. Poco antes, otra niña de cuatro años, atendida en la misma clínica ese mismo día, había ingresado en el mismo hospital con fiebre, vómitos y somnolencia. Tras ser estabilizada, fue trasladada en una unidad SAMU a la UCI pediátrica del Hospital Clínico Universitario de València, donde continúa ingresada. Las autoridades sanitarias han suspendido cautelarmente la actividad de la clínica dental mientras se investiga el origen de ambos casos.

Mehdi, su hermano menor de 20 años, fue asesinado en noviembre mientras estacionaba su coche en el centro de Marsella, presuntamente como una advertencia dirigida a Amine. A raíz del asesinato, Amine ha recibido amenazas de muerte y ha estado bajo protección policial, incluso debiendo abandonar la ciudad temporalmente. En Le Monde escribió que perdía a su hermano y que alzaba la voz contra la violencia del narcotráfico. Este caso ha llevado al gobierno francés a calificar el hecho como un punto de inflexión en la lucha contra las drogas y ha impulsado medidas como la creación de una fiscalía especial para el crimen organizado y el endurecimiento de las penas para narcotraficantes. Paralelamente, Brahim, otro hermano, ya había sido asesinado en 2020, lo que impulsó a Amine a cr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amine-kessaci-joven-activista-frances-continua-denunciando-la-violencia-de-las-bandas-de-narcotrafico-pese-a-amenazas-y-perdidas-familiares</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amine-kessaci-joven-activista-frances-continua-denunciando-la-violencia-de-las-bandas-de-narcotrafico-pese-a-amenazas-y-perdidas-familiares</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflexiones finales de Etel Adnan: memoria, amor y contradicción en la frontera de la vida]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo presenta un acercamiento íntimo y profundo a la figura de Etel Adnan, poeta, pintora y editora, en su etapa final de vida. Bajo la colección Miniaturas de la editorial Tránsito, el texto recoge fragmentos de sus últimas palabras, en las que fusiona lo personal con lo universal, hablando de temas como el calentamiento global, incendios, la poesía, la inteligencia artificial y su propia existencia como parte del cosmos. Adnan utiliza una narración fragmentada, evocadora y poética, donde la contradicción es recurrente como forma de aceptación de la complejidad humana. Se resalta la estrecha conexión entre el individuo y el mundo, denunciando ciertos aspectos sociales y defendiendo la importancia del arte y la poesía como elementos esenciales. Este diálogo con la autora nos ofrece una lección sobre la vida y la muerte, un llamado a desplazar el silencio y escuchar la historia de todo lo que nos rodea, vista desde la sensibilidad de quien sabe que se despide del mundo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexiones-finales-de-etel-adnan-memoria-amor-y-contradiccion-en-la-frontera-de-la-vida</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexiones-finales-de-etel-adnan-memoria-amor-y-contradiccion-en-la-frontera-de-la-vida</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 14:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La IEA advierte de un exceso de petróleo que podría alcanzar 4 millones de barriles al día en 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Agencia Internacional de la Energía (IEA) advierte que el mundo está produciendo más petróleo del que necesita y que, de cara a 2026, podría verse un excedente de aproximadamente 4 millones de barriles por día. Este probable desacople entre oferta y demanda se produce pese a que los mayores productores acordaron pausar un plan para aumentar las exportaciones de crudo. El informe de la IEA atribuye el exceso a un crecimiento de la demanda más lento de lo habitual, incluso cuando se esperan nuevos proyectos de energías renovables y una adopción acelerada de vehículos eléctricos en varias regiones. Además, el informe contiene escenarios en los que la demanda global seguiría aumentando hasta 2050, lo que ha generado debates sobre el rumbo de la transición energética. En cualquier escenario, la renovación de proyectos e inversiones en energías limpias continúa, y la capacidad de generación renovable se espera que se duplique en los próximos años.

A pesar de sus amplias adiciones, como fuentes bibliográficas más extensas, Grokipedia introduce cambios significativos en los temas más sensibles, como la política y la biografía de figuras públicas. Además, se ha detectado un aumento alarmante en el uso de fuentes consideradas poco fiables, incluyendo sitios asociados con desinformación y discursos extremistas. En especial, el uso de Stormfront y Infowars destaca como un claro ejemplo de las fuentes problemáticas que Grokipedia cita de forma recurrente.

Según el escrito, varias personas que actuaron como escoltas o personal de protección no contaban con la Tarjeta de Identificación Profesional (TIP) ni la habilitación oficial requerida por la Ley 5/2014 de Seguridad Privada, lo que supone una infracción muy grave sancionable con multas de hasta 30.000 euros.

Fue un estudiante mediocre, situándose en la posición 251 de 310 en su promoción militar, y era apodado 'Cerillita' y 'Paquita, la Culona' por sus compañeros debido a su baja estatura, complexión débil y voz atiplada. Durante su servicio en África en 1916, Franco perdió un testículo a consecuencia de heridas, hecho que no fue público pero confirmado por su nieta. Casado con Carmen Polo, existen controversias sobre la paternidad de su hija Carmen, vinculando a su hermano Ramón Franco como posible padre. En la sublevación de 1936, Franco fue apodado 'Miss Islas Canarias 1936' por su reticencia inicial a participar. A lo largo de su dictadura, mostró un estilo autoritario y un lento avance militar para estabilizar su régimen. También cultivó intereses en el cine y la escritura, llegando a firmar artículos con pseudónimos y escribir el guion de la película 'Raza'.

A lo largo de la pieza se cita a economistas como Nick Hanauer y Thomas Piketty, quienes argumentan que este modelo es erróneo, ya que solo ha incrementado la desigualdad sin generar los beneficios prometidos. Hanauer, en particular, desafía las ideas neoliberales desde su propia experiencia como millonario, mostrando que el sistema en el que las grandes empresas pagan menos impuestos solo favorece a los ricos y no a la población en general. Además, se señala que, por el contrario, cuando los impuestos a las grandes fortunas son altos, se consigue un crecimiento económico sostenido y una menor desigualdad social.

Esta maniobra fue revelada por un mensaje filtrado de Ignacio Cosidó, lo que frustró el nombramiento de Marchena. El libro también alerta sobre la politización del fiscal general del Estado y los peligros que conlleva que este cargo sea un instrumento de presión política. La controversia actual sobre la condena del fiscal general se enmarca en esta dinámica, criticando que el Supremo ha condenado al fiscal por su designación política más que por delitos probados.

Tras la victoria del bando sublevado en 1939, el régimen franquista instauró un control total sobre la sociedad, y uno de sus pilares fue la represión sistemática y brutal contra cualquier forma de oposición. Durante la Guerra Civil y los años posteriores, se produjo una masiva eliminación física de republicanos y opositores, que incluyó asesinatos extrajudiciales y fusilamientos bajo el régimen de los consejos de guerra. La represión se extendió más allá de la guerra, con una persecución sistemática en tiempos de paz, a través de procesos judiciales sin garantías y la imposición de penas severas, incluidas las condenas a muerte.

En COP30, la investigadora Han Yinghui subraya que la N2O es decisiva para alcanzar metas de temperatura y recuerda que las emisiones derivadas de la agricultura son predominantes, aunque otros sectores como energía, residuos e industria también contribuyen.

En declaraciones a Hora 25, Martín aseguró que los fiscales están 'noqueados' y lamentó que el Alto Tribunal haya condenado, a su juicio, a 'un hombre inocente'. Según el dirigente de la UPF, esta decisión tendrá consecuencias profundas sobre la confianza ciudadana en la justicia. 

La asociación de fiscales sostiene que la sentencia carece de elementos probatorios suficientes y cuestiona que el fallo se haya adelantado sin motivación jurídica, lo que consideran un 'gravísimo error'. Martín subrayó que la esencia de la presunción de inocencia reside en la motivación de las sentencias y advirtió que privar a la sociedad de esa explicación genera 'una peligrosísima sensación de opacidad'.

El fallo, emitido por la Sala II del Supremo, impone una inhabilitación de dos años y una multa de 7.200 euros, además de una indemnización de 10.000 euros a la pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Alberto González Amador, por daños morales. Rufián enfatizó que “no se toca” a Ayuso y que la contienda no se limitaría a un caso aislado, subrayando una lucha ideológica entre partes y corrientes políticas. La sentencia no fue unánime; cinco de los siete magistrados votaron a favor, con las magistradas progresistas Ana Ferrer y Susana como disidentes.

Este incidente marcó el primer juicio por un presunto delito cometido en el espacio. Tras una larga investigación, se ha demostrado que Worden mintió en su acusación, ya que admitió haber proporcionado la contraseña de la cuenta a McClain en 2015. El fallo de este caso resalta la importancia de la verdad en un proceso legal, sobre todo cuando se trata de acusaciones que cruzan las fronteras del espacio. El juicio ahora se centra en las consecuencias legales para Worden, quien podría enfrentarse a hasta cinco años de prisión y una multa de 250.000 dólares por falso testimonio.

Esta decisión, proclamada sin motivación detallada, coincide con una maniobra política que desplaza otros escándalos y reordena la agenda pública a favor de la oposición ultraconservadora. Asimismo, se interpreta como una advertencia indirecta para condicionar a la prensa y a quienes fiscalizan el poder, en un contexto donde se evidencia la persistencia de un aparato judicial con influencias políticas, un cesarismo judicial que actúa sin rendir cuentas democráticas.

Destaca que la Jefatura del Estado debería derivar de la voluntad ciudadana y no del azar biológico, por lo que la instauración de la III República sería la culminación lógica de un proceso para modernizar y hacer más participativa y transparente la democracia española. Señala que la monarquía parlamentaria no es compatible con la soberanía popular porque la legitimidad republicana nace de la elección directa de los ciudadanos, no de la herencia. Aboga por un sistema político que refleje igualdad, rendición de cuentas y racionalidad institucional, mencionando ejemplos de repúblicas europeas modernas que refuerzan la neutralidad del Estado con presidentes elegidos y funciones simbólicas. La III República es vista como una reforma integral para responder a desafíos actuales como la descentralización, la igualdad real de género, la diversidad terr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-necesidad-historica-y-democratica-de-instaurar-la-iii-republica-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-necesidad-historica-y-democratica-de-instaurar-la-iii-republica-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El fiscal superior de Cantabria critica la condena al fiscal general y cuestiona su legitimidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[El fiscal superior de Cantabria, Jesús Arteaga, ha expresado su desacuerdo con la condena del Tribunal Supremo contra el fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, a dos años de inhabilitación por un delito de revelación de secretos. Arteaga considera esta condena 'absolutamente injusta' y señala que el fallo no tiene validez jurídica efectiva hasta que se justifique en una sentencia formal. Aunque la decisión fue adoptada por mayoría en la Sala de lo Penal del TS, Arteaga subraya que el fiscal general tiene derecho a recurrir al Tribunal Constitucional una vez quede inhabilitado. La sentencia incluye una multa y una indemnización al empresario Alberto González Amador, vinculado a la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Este fallo llega en un contexto de reflexión sobre los derechos fundamentales y la libertad de expresión, en un día simbólico para la democracia española, que conmemora el 50 aniversario de la muerte de Franco.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-superior-de-cantabria-critica-la-condena-al-fiscal-general-y-cuestiona-su-legitimidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fiscal-superior-de-cantabria-critica-la-condena-al-fiscal-general-y-cuestiona-su-legitimidad</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 02:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La condena al fiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz desata una crisis judicial y política sin precedentes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo ha condenado al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, a una inhabilitación de dos años y a una multa de 7.200 euros por un delito de revelación de datos reservados.

Durante el despegue, el motor izquierdo, junto con el pilón que lo sujetaba, se desprendió, cayendo por encima y a la derecha del avión. El incendio del ala afectó gravemente al aparato, que apenas logró elevarse a unos diez metros antes de impactar con un almacén de UPS y otros edificios cercanos. El siniestro causó la muerte de 14 personas, entre ellas los tres pilotos, y dejó 23 heridos, dos de ellos graves. Las imágenes obtenidas por las cámaras de seguridad del aeropuerto confirman los daños del motor y el ala, que estuvieron activos hasta el momento del impacto.

Según un informe de Human Rights Watch (HRW), basado en entrevistas a desplazados, análisis de imágenes satelitales y documentación visual, se han destruido o dañado gravemente más de 850 viviendas, y la cifra podría llegar a 1.460 edificios según datos satelitales de la ONU. El informe denuncia que las autoridades israelíes impiden el regreso de los desplazados a sus hogares desde hace más de diez meses, bloqueando además las entradas a los campamentos. HRW acusa a Israel de violar la Convención de Ginebra y de cometer crímenes de guerra y contra la humanidad, señalando que la operación no está justificada ni garantiza condiciones seguras para los civiles desplazados.

La asistencia fue menor que en años anteriores y superada ampliamente por periodistas de diversos países. Los asistentes, mayormente nostálgicos del régimen franquista, portaban símbolos franquistas y cantaron el 'Cara al Sol' con el saludo fascista, a pesar de que estos actos están prohibidos por la Ley de Memoria Democrática, que busca evitar la exaltación del franquismo en público. El presidente Pedro Sánchez ha condenado públicamente estas exaltaciones y ha recordado que ninguna democracia honra a golpistas.

Esta emblemática insignia, que se vincula estrechamente con el asesinato de millones de judíos durante el Holocausto y contra la que lucharon más de 400.000 soldados estadounidenses durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, será clasificada en su lugar como 'potencialmente divisiva'. Esta decisión forma parte de una nueva política que también redefinirá otros símbolos controvertidos, como los lazos y la bandera confederada. Aunque la bandera confederada se sigue considerando inapropiada para su exhibición, se ha rebajado su nivel de gravedad en comparación con la política anterior.

Analizando datos de más de 1.900 puntos de observación entre 2013 y 2022, los científicos detectaron un aumento del 2-3% en especies como los mirlos y los pinzones en los cuatro años posteriores a la restricción. La investigación, liderada por Thomas Perrot, señala que aunque la mejora es modesta, demuestra la eficacia de la medida en la conservación de la avifauna. Se estima que el pleno restablecimiento de las poblaciones podría tardar décadas, ya que los residuos de neonicotinoides persisten años en el suelo. La prohibición, implantada por la UE en 2018 tras una fuerte presión pública, se enfrenta aún a excepciones y a la resistencia de la industria agroquímica.

El Adviento es un periodo de preparación para la Navidad que inicia el cuarto domingo antes del 25 de diciembre, y según la tradición religiosa, es un tiempo de recogimiento y espera para la venida de Jesús. Por tanto, aunque el puente de la Inmaculada es un momento popularmente elegido para decorar, el momento litúrgico ideal para hacerlo es antes de la víspera de Navidad. La noticia subraya que la tradición de poner el árbol de Navidad durante este puente tiene más que ver con la disponibilidad de tiempo que con una relación directa con la celebración religiosa.

Este cambio está impulsado por una combinación de incentivos gubernamentales, expansión de infraestructura de carga rápida y un innovador sistema de intercambio rápido de baterías implementado por el mayor fabricante de baterías del mundo, CATL. Como resultado, la demanda de diésel y gas natural licuado (GNL) en China empieza a estancarse y retroceder, lo que tiene un impacto global en los mercados energéticos. China prepara además nuevas normativas de emisiones que restringirán el uso de vehículos fósiles, mientras que apuesta por exportar su modelo de camión eléctrico y cadena de producción al resto del mundo. Aunque el precio y la infraestructura aún son retos, la electrificación del transporte pesado en China ya marca una tendencia que h]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-acelera-la-adopcion-de-camiones-electricos-desafiando-el-mercado-del-diesel-y-el-gas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-acelera-la-adopcion-de-camiones-electricos-desafiando-el-mercado-del-diesel-y-el-gas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El marido de Ayuso compra el ático en el mismo edificio donde viven]]></title><description><![CDATA[Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha adquirido un ático en el mismo edificio en el que ambos residen, según informan varios medios de comunicación. Este nuevo inmueble sería la segunda propiedad del empresario, quien ya había comprado anteriormente otro piso en el mismo edificio en 2022, tras un presunto fraude fiscal superior a 350.000 euros. La operación se habría realizado con la ayuda de una hipoteca de 600.000 euros proporcionada por Caja Rural de Zamora. Los detalles de la compra se han conocido a través de medios como El País, que informan que el ático está situado en la séptima planta del edificio. La noticia ha generado un gran revuelo en las redes sociales, donde se critica el lujo y la ostentación de la pareja de Ayuso, especialmente en un contexto de crisis económica y de vivienda en España, donde los precios del mercado inmobiliario han alcanzado cifras históricas.

En la nueva versión, los CDC afirman que no se puede asegurar que las vacunas no causen autismo, lo que contradice décadas de estudios científicos que han demostrado la ausencia de un vínculo entre ambas. Investigaciones revisadas por pares, incluyendo metaanálisis y estudios realizados en diversos países como Dinamarca, el Reino Unido y Japón, han demostrado que no existe relación entre las vacunas, como la MMR (triple vírica), y el autismo. Esta actualización ha sido criticada por expertos que señalan que no hay base científica que apoye esta afirmación, y alertan de que podría generar desinformación sobre la seguridad de las vacunas. A pesar de esto, el CDC justifica el cambio debido a la necesidad de cumplir con la Data Quality Act (DQA), lo que ha generado controversia y preocupación entre los prof]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cdc-cambia-su-postura-sobre-el-vinculo-entre-vacunas-y-autismo-contradiciendo-estudios-previos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cdc-cambia-su-postura-sobre-el-vinculo-entre-vacunas-y-autismo-contradiciendo-estudios-previos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El jefe del Ejército francés advierte sobre la posibilidad de perder a jóvenes en una guerra con Rusia en los próximos años]]></title><description><![CDATA[El jefe del Estado Mayor de las Fuerzas Armadas francesas, Fabien Mandon, ha generado controversia al pedir a la sociedad francesa que se prepare para un posible enfrentamiento bélico con Rusia dentro de tres o cuatro años. En un encuentro con alcaldes franceses, Mandon afirmó que, aunque Francia dispone de los medios para disuadir a Moscú, el verdadero reto será la fortaleza del país para aceptar las bajas humanas que implicaría una guerra, incluso la muerte de sus hijos. Este mensaje, que subraya la necesidad de un rearme militar en Europa, ha provocado reacciones airadas tanto en la izquierda como en la derecha francesa, incluidos partidos como La Francia Insumisa y el grupo de extrema derecha Reagrupamiento Nacional, que han criticado la retórica belicista del líder militar.

Además, llevaba una gorra con el mismo eslogan. Este gesto ha sorprendido porque es poco común en la imagen corporativa de un líder de una multinacional. El evento, relacionado con el automovilismo y organizado por la Asociación Japonesa de Negocios y Cultura Automovilística, reflejó un apoyo público estratégico hacia Trump, dado el interés de Toyota en el mercado estadounidense y la reciente intención de la empresa de invertir 10.000 millones de dólares más en Estados Unidos, elevando la inversión total a cerca de 60.000 millones de dólares.

En el video, los demócratas expresaron su preocupación por los posibles abusos de poder del gobierno de Trump y la amenaza a la Constitución de EE.

La reacción de Trump incluyó publicaciones en redes sociales en las que también repostó comentarios que instaban a que los legisladores fueran arrestados e incluso colgados.

La sentencia ha sido muy controvertida, ya que se basa en un caso de filtraciones que no se han demostrado fehacientemente. Se ha ignorado el testimonio de varios periodistas que defendieron la inocencia del fiscal, indicando que la fuente de la filtración no era él, sino otras personas relacionadas con el caso. Además, la condena ha sido vista como un ataque a la libertad de información, ya que el Supremo ha desoído el derecho al secreto profesional de los periodistas, y la filtración se habría originado fuera de la Fiscalía General.

Se cuestiona la gravedad del delito imputado, considerado insignificante, y cómo se banalizan delitos basados en recortes de prensa, en un contexto judicial influenciado por políticos de derecha. Se plantea la imparcialidad de la Unidad Central Operativa (UCO) de la Guardia Civil en la instrucción, y el hecho de que intervenga en áreas urbanas en lugar del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía.

Se prohibieron partidos políticos y sindicatos libres, se impuso una censura estricta en prensa, cine y televisión, y se reprimió el uso de las lenguas cooficiales. La mujer casada carecía de autonomía jurídica, dependiendo totalmente del permiso marital del marido para actos cotidianos. La diversidad sexual fue perseguida y criminalizada mediante leyes y cuadros policiales. Hubo tribunales especiales para delitos políticos y se aplicó la pena de muerte. La economía estuvo intervenida con cartillas de racionamiento y un modelo autárquico hasta la apertura económica de finales de los años 50. Las libertades civiles y políticas fueron recuperándose lentamente desde 1959 en adelante, con hitos como la Ley de Prensa de 1966, la eliminación del permiso marital en 1975, la Ley de huelga de 1977 y la Constitución de 1978, que estableció un marco democrático con iguald]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan critica a Trump por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein y revela interés en comprar su isla privada]]></title><description><![CDATA[En una entrevista larga con el comediante Brian Simpson, Joe Rogan se mofó de Donald Trump respecto a su manejo del caso Epstein y confesó que pensó en comprar la isla privada del difunto delincuente sexual en el Caribe.

Sin embargo, en los últimos días, el presidente ha cambiado su discurso y ha apoyado públicamente la publicación de dichos archivos, que aún permanecen confidenciales. Además, Rogan reveló que en el pasado evaluó la compra de Little Saint James, una isla en las Islas Vírgenes de Estados Unidos conocida por su vínculo con Epstein, y admitió que estuvo dispuesto a pagar unos 55 millones de dólares por ella.

Hernández considera que esta sentencia es el resultado de una ofensiva judicial de la derecha contra el Gobierno, citando las palabras del expresidente José María Aznar sobre la investidura de Pedro Sánchez.

A través de su participación en la serie documental ‘La conquista de la democracia’, Sartorius denuncia cómo la historia que se ha contado de este periodo está 'edulcorada y falseada'. Según Sartorius, mientras Franco murió en la cama, la dictadura realmente se desmoronó gracias a la presión popular en las calles, que incluyó masivas huelgas y manifestaciones. El exdiputado de IU recuerda que, tras la muerte de Franco, la dictadura intentó mantenerse con el nombramiento de Arias Navarro como presidente, lo que generó una gran movilización social que cambió el rumbo del país.

Investigaciones de periodistas e historiadores revelan que desde la Guerra Civil comenzó a gestionar dinero en múltiples cuentas, con un capital que en 1940 equivaldría a más de 388 millones de euros actuales. Su riqueza provenía no solo de su salario, sino también de fondos de guerra, comisiones y beneficios obtenidos mediante prácticas poco transparentes y leyes que beneficiaban al régimen. Además, adquirió propiedades valiosas, entre ellas palacios y fincas, que luego fueron gestionadas y vendidas por sus descendientes.

Surgen dudas sobre la privacidad, ya que la baliza incorpora una tarjeta eSIM con datos móviles, pero la Agencia Española de Protección de Datos aclara que hasta que la baliza no se activa, no emite datos ni comparte ubicación.

Los 5.000 euros que su expareja debía abonar para la manutención de su hijo fueron entregados erróneamente a otra mujer. La situación se agravó cuando la destinataria del dinero, que lo había gastado, pactó con el juzgado devolver solo una pequeña cantidad mensual. El juzgado se ha desentendido del conflicto, aconsejando a Antonia que reclame directamente a la mujer que recibió el dinero. La mujer afectada denuncia que este error no es solo una negligencia administrativa, sino que tiene consecuencias graves para su vida y la de su hijo. Exige que se depuren responsabilidades y que se recupere el dinero lo antes posible, pero la falta de acción por parte del juzgado dificulta la resolución del caso.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/error-administrativo-deja-a-mujer-sin-la-manutencion-de-su-hijo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/error-administrativo-deja-a-mujer-sin-la-manutencion-de-su-hijo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta condenada a indemnizar con 479 millones a medios españoles por uso indebido de datos y competencia desleal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un juzgado de Madrid ha dictado sentencia condenatoria contra Meta, la empresa matriz de Facebook e Instagram, por utilizar indebidamente datos personales protegidos de usuarios españoles para obtener una ventaja competitiva en publicidad digital, en detrimento de 87 editoras de prensa digital y agencias de noticias en España. La demanda, que inicialmente reclamaba 551 millones de euros, se ha estimado parcialmente concediendo una indemnización de 479 millones de euros. La sentencia subraya que el uso indebido de estos datos viola las normas europeas de protección y supone una práctica desleal que afecta directamente la sostenibilidad económica de los medios digitales españoles. Este caso representa un precedente importante para la regulación y competencia en el mercado publicitario digital frente a grandes plataformas tecnológicas, y puede influir en litigios similares en la Unión Europea.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/meta-condenada-a-indemnizar-con-479-millones-a-medios-espanoles-por-uso-indebido-de-datos-y-competencia-desleal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/meta-condenada-a-indemnizar-con-479-millones-a-medios-espanoles-por-uso-indebido-de-datos-y-competencia-desleal</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El legado del barco pirata de Playmobil: un juguete clásico que ha perdurado décadas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El barco pirata de Playmobil, lanzado en 1978 bajo el código 3550, se ha convertido en uno de los juguetes más emblemáticos para los niños nacidos a mediados de los años 70. Este juguete, diseñado por Hans Beck, ha acompañado a generaciones de niños desde su aparición, jugando tanto en interiores como en exteriores. Con un diseño innovador para la época, el barco incluía un casco flotante, cañones, un bote de remos y, por supuesto, cinco piratas como tripulación. Además, sus velas cuadradas y los detalles del camarote del capitán hicieron de este juguete una pieza única. Con el paso del tiempo, Playmobil ha lanzado varias versiones de este barco, actualizando su diseño, pero manteniendo su esencia. A pesar de las actualizaciones, el barco original sigue siendo un símbolo de la nostalgia para aquellos que crecieron con él.

Nacido en León en 1896, Durruti se convirtió en una figura central en la lucha obrera y revolucionaria, particularmente en el contexto de la Guerra Civil española. A lo largo de su vida, estuvo involucrado en diversas acciones de sabotaje y resistencia contra el poder establecido, tanto en España como en el extranjero. Fue un miembro destacado de la CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) y de grupos anarquistas como 'Los Justicieros' y 'Los Solidarios', con los que llevó a cabo una serie de acciones violentas contra la clase dominante y las instituciones autoritarias. Aunque su vida fue breve, falleciendo en 1936 durante la Guerra Civil, su legado perdura en la memoria de quienes luchan por la libertad y la justicia social.

Este ataque se enmarca en un contexto de creciente hostilidad hacia el Centro de Primera Acogida de Hortaleza, que ha sido objeto de varios ataques, incluyendo una brutal paliza a otros menores en septiembre.

Esta postura ha sido criticada por partidos como Más Madrid, que demandaba una condena explícita, mientras que Ayuso justifica su postura en que nació en democracia y que la historia debe mirar hacia adelante. La presidenta también ha evitado pronunciar palabras como Franco, dictadura o golpe de Estado, y ha propuesto olvidar lo ocurrido durante la dictadura, señalando que la mayoría de los presentes nacieron en democracia y que el enfoque debe ser hacia un futuro unido.

La experimentación, que se realizó a través de fibras ópticas de solo 10 metros, demuestra que es posible transmitir información cuántica mediante un proceso llamado teleportación sin que los fotones sean distinguibles, gracias a convertidores de frecuencia cuántica. Este desarrollo no solo representa un logro técnico, sino que también demuestra que en un futuro cercano será posible superar las limitaciones actuales del alcance del internet, como la necesidad de amplificadores en cada 50 kilómetros.

Cruzando la información facilitada por la empresa del parking y las declaraciones de Vilaplana, se concluye que su salida ocurrió entre las 19.12 y las 19.47 horas. Según registros de pago, el vehículo asociado a Vilaplana habría entrado al parking aproximadamente entre las 13.40 y las 14.45, y abandonado el garaje más tarde de lo declarado tanto por la periodista como por el presidente de la Generalitat en funciones, Carlos Mazón. La versión más plausible apunta a una salida a las 19.47, pagando 15,10 euros por poco más de cinco horas de estacionamiento.

La memoria de las heridas abiertas, como la ejecución de Federico García Lorca y las decenas de miles de víctimas en fosas comunes, revela que vivir con miedo, sin derechos y bajo represión no puede considerarse mejor. Se analizan aspectos como la represión política, la pérdida de derechos civiles y la persecución de la diversidad sexual, además de la pobreza y atraso material en los años previos a la democratización. A cincuenta años de la muerte de Franco, el artículo señala que la verdadera historia requiere recordar que la libertad no se vivía, sino que se sobrevivía en una dictadura que sembró terror y desigualdad. La transición hacia la democracia supuso un avance enorme en derechos y libertades, por lo que recordar estos hechos es una obligación moral para entender la importancia de la libertad y evitar mitos nostálgicos que so]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-memoria-historica-y-los-mitos-del-franquismo-en-granada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-memoria-historica-y-los-mitos-del-franquismo-en-granada</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 12:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España avanza en la carrera global por el GaN, un compuesto clave en defensa y tecnología militar]]></title><description><![CDATA[España ha dado un paso importante en la tecnología de defensa con la reciente incorporación de una planta en Vigo dedicada a la producción de chips fotónicos basados en GaN (Nitruro de Galio). Este compuesto es esencial para mejorar la potencia de armas, radares y sistemas de defensa electrónicos. A través de Indra, empresa española de defensa, España se une a un selecto grupo de solo siete países con capacidad para producir este material estratégico, que tiene aplicaciones cruciales en la detección de amenazas como drones, misiles y vehículos hostiles. La planta, operada por SPARC, una start-up gallega con participación mayoritaria de Indra, producirá semiconductores de GaN, un material clave para la mejora de la radiofrecuencia y la potencia de los radares militares. El GaN es fundamental para las Fuerzas Armadas, ya que permite mejorar la capacidad de los sistemas de radar y las armas de energía dirigida, dos elementos claves en la guerra moderna.

Entre ellos destacan los llamados “jetons de maison close”, pequeños tokens empleados en los burdeles parisinos durante la Belle Époque y épocas anteriores. Estas fichas, que a primera vista podían confundirse con monedas corrientes, escondían en su reverso grabados explícitos que indicaban el tipo de servicio que representaban. Funcionaban como una forma de pago previa: el cliente las adquiría en la entrada del establecimiento y las entregaba después a la trabajadora sexual, lo que permitía mantener la discreción y evitar conversaciones incómodas o explícitas. Además, ayudaban a las madamas a llevar un control más ordenado de la actividad y del reparto de ganancias. El origen de este sistema se remonta a la antigua Roma, donde existían las spintriae, piezas de bronce o latón que mostraban números y escenas sexuales. Aunque algunos historiadores sugieren que también pudieron emplearse como fichas de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-los-tokens-utilizados-en-los-burdeles-de-paris</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-los-tokens-utilizados-en-los-burdeles-de-paris</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 11:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El proyecto Guggenheim en Urdaibai enfrenta importantes retos legales y ecologistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El proyecto para construir el Guggenheim en Urdaibai, un icono turístico planeado por el Gobierno Vasco que incluiría dos sedes conectadas por una pasarela sobre la Reserva de la Biosfera de Urdaibai, se encuentra en pausa debido a procesos judiciales liderados por asociaciones ecologistas y vecinos. Tres demandas en la Audiencia Nacional cuestionan la reducción de la zona de protección litoral de 100 a 20 metros, la caducidad de una concesión administrativa otorgada en 1943 para Astilleros de Murueta SA que ocupa terrenos públicos, y los derechos no reconocidos del vecindario sobre los terrenos donde pasaría una vía verde que uniría las dos sedes del museo. La situación se complica por el desacuerdo entre distintas administraciones acerca del impacto ambiental y el uso del espacio protegido, con informes que advierten de la degradación del ecosistema y la insuficiencia de los senderos previstos para la alta afluencia turística.

Guijarro, quien ha protagonizado varios incidentes de este tipo en el pasado, le dijo a Ibáñez que 'a callar, que estás más guapa', además de otros comentarios como 'ridícula' y 'vete a la mierda'. Estos ataques fueron realizados mientras se discutían cuestiones relacionadas con el tráfico y el transporte público. A pesar de las peticiones de rectificación y de la expulsión de Guijarro por parte de Más Madrid y el PSOE, el Gobierno regional no ha tomado ninguna medida hasta el momento. En la misma sesión, Guijarro también desoyó las llamadas al orden de la alcaldesa, Alicia Gallego, y continuó con su actitud provocadora.

Este fenómeno, que ha ido en aumento desde los años 70 y se ha intensificado en las últimas dos décadas, genera preocupación entre expertos en salud pública por sus posibles efectos en la sociedad y en la demografía del país. Las causas incluyen largas jornadas laborales, precariedad laboral, cambios en los roles de género y una cultura que prioriza la estabilidad antes del compromiso de pareja. Además, la existencia de relaciones de pareja sin sexo y la popularidad de alternativas como la fictosexualidad y los servicios sexuales comerciales reflejan un cambio en las prioridades y en la expresión de la sexualidad. Este contexto coincide con una baja tasa de natalidad y una población en descenso. Aunque la tendencia a la inactividad sexual no es exclusiva de Japón y se observa también en países occidentales, la situación]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-por-el-aumento-de-la-inactividad-sexual-entre-jovenes-japoneses-y-sus-repercusiones-sociales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-por-el-aumento-de-la-inactividad-sexual-entre-jovenes-japoneses-y-sus-repercusiones-sociales</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 11:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El microprocesador MP944 del caza F-14 fue anterior y más potente que el Intel 4004]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aunque la historia común atribuye al Intel 4004 el título de primer microprocesador, este chip fue en realidad precedido por el MP944, utilizado en el caza Grumman F-14 Tomcat en 1970, un año antes del lanzamiento del 4004 en 1971. El MP944, desarrollado por Garrett AiResearch y usado para controlar el sistema de alas de barrido variable del F-14, era ocho veces más rápido que el Intel 4004. Sin embargo, su existencia se mantuvo oculta hasta 1998, lo que permitió que Intel obtuviera el reconocimiento histórico como pionero. El Intel 4004, diseñado originalmente para una calculadora, fue el primer microprocesador comercialmente disponible y abrió la puerta a la tecnología que permitió la informática en dispositivos de uso general. Paralelamente, otros microprocesadores como el Four-Phase Systems AL1 compitieron por el lugar de primer microprocesador, pero sin la misma difusión y reconocimiento.

Estas redadas resultaron en la detención de más de 200 inmigrantes en diversas áreas, incluyendo restaurantes, supermercados y otras localidades. La respuesta de la comunidad educativa ha sido de preocupación y apoyo, con muchas instituciones expresando que no deben ser un lugar de temor para los estudiantes y sus familias. La disminución en la asistencia escolar se atribuye al miedo y la incertidumbre generados por estas operaciones, que afectan especialmente a las comunidades hispanas, que representan un 31% del alumnado. Las autoridades escolares han reiterado que no poseen información sobre planes de redadas en sus instalaciones y que no comparten datos de los estudiantes salvo por obligación legal.

La investigación se basa en los datos del Estudio de Salud de las Enfermeras II, que ha seguido a más de 29.000 participantes desde 1991. Los resultados indican que las mujeres que consumían cerca de diez porciones diarias de ultraprocesados tenían un riesgo un 45 % mayor de desarrollar adenomas convencionales, un tipo de pólipo que puede evolucionar hacia un cáncer de intestino, en comparación con quienes ingerían alrededor de tres porciones diarias. Los autores subrayan que el hallazgo no implica una relación de causalidad directa, pero sí señala un posible factor que podría contribuir al incremento de diagnósticos de cáncer colorrectal en personas jóvenes.

Según el informe, que recomienda remitir el caso a la Fiscalía al ver indicios de coacciones y abuso de autoridad, los hechos se produjeron al menos desde 2020 e incluyeron presiones verbales, bloqueos laborales y propuestas de traslado injustificadas. Entre las personas beneficiadas por esas supuestas presiones para retirar multas habría cargos como la vicepresidenta de la Diputación de Granada.

Durante años, la familia guardó silencio sobre los hechos, pues la madre de Pablo no mencionó nada sobre la tragedia, paralizada por el miedo. Ahora, tras descubrir los documentos, Pablo ha sabido que su padre desempeñó un cargo importante como secretario de la sociedad de trabajadores de la tierra en la comarca del Jiloca, una posición crucial en tiempos difíciles.
