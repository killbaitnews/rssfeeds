It focuses on the frustration of Zionist figures, like Sara Hurwitz, who lament how the younger generation rejects traditional Zionist narratives, influenced by the graphic portrayal of violence in Gaza. Hurwitz expresses concern that the Holocaust education used to counter antisemitism is no longer effective in this new media landscape. The piece argues that the dominant narrative of Israel's righteousness is rapidly unraveling as people see the violence in Gaza in real time. The article further criticizes the simplistic framing of Zionism and Israel as a 'family' in an attempt to emotionally manipulate audiences, while highlighting the tension between global perspectives and Israeli actions. Ultimately, the article portrays a shift in perception, with more people now questioning Israel's actions in Gaza and resisting narratives that ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-social-media-in-shaping-perceptions-of-the-gaza-conflict</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-social-media-in-shaping-perceptions-of-the-gaza-conflict</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Capitalism, Not Women, Is Fueling Men’s Loneliness Crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this commentary, Amanda Marcotte argues that male loneliness is being exacerbated by capitalist systems rather than the fault of women. She criticizes the monetization of loneliness by figures like Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, who may be encouraging men’s emotional dependence on AI-powered romantic chatbots for profit. Marcotte highlights how influencers, crypto grifters, and pick-up artists profit from male isolation, promoting anti-social behaviors and pushing men further into virtual worlds rather than fostering real-world connections. The article calls for a rethinking of male loneliness as a systemic issue rather than a result of societal expectations of men or women. Ultimately, Marcotte advocates for solutions that address the economic structures driving this loneliness, such as regulating online spaces and AI, rather than blaming women or reinforcing outdated gender norms.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/capitalism-not-women-is-fueling-men-s-loneliness-crisis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/capitalism-not-women-is-fueling-men-s-loneliness-crisis</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 09:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[MAGA Influencers Revealed to Be Operating from Abroad, Causing Online Stir]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent investigation has uncovered that a number of popular MAGA (Make America Great Again) social media influencers are not based in the U.S., as many had assumed, but are actually operating from foreign countries. This revelation came to light after podcaster Matt Binder shared screenshots of various accounts, such as 'Charlie's Voice Rising' (based in Eastern Europe) and 'Defiant Ls' (from Japan). Another account, 'Americaman,' was traced to Indonesia. The exposure has sparked significant backlash, especially as some of these influencers have large followings, including 'Defiant Ls,' which has 1.6 million followers. Even former President Donald Trump was involved when he shared a post from a MAGA account based in South Asia, drawing criticism from those who are questioning the authenticity and origins of the MAGA movement's social media presence. Critics are now asking if any MAGA accounts are genuinely U.S.-based, raising concerns about foreign influence in American politics and ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/maga-influencers-revealed-to-be-operating-from-abroad-causing-online-stir</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/maga-influencers-revealed-to-be-operating-from-abroad-causing-online-stir</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 05:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukrainian Military Losses May Exceed 1 Million, Rada Member States]]></title><description><![CDATA[Vadim Ivchenko, a member of Ukraine's National Security Committee, has claimed that Ukraine's armed forces have suffered devastating casualties, with more than 500,000 killed and an equal number wounded. He noted that many of the wounded soldiers are no longer able to serve, and that the actual number of casualties could be even higher than officially acknowledged. According to Ivchenko, soldiers who are missing or unaccounted for have not been included in these estimates. He suggested that the true scale of Ukraine’s military losses could be much larger. During a UN Security Council session, it was stated that Ukraine may have lost as many as 1.7 million service members since the conflict began. This figure includes not only the dead and wounded, but also those who are unaccounted for or missing. The data provided by Ivchenko and the UN reflects the heavy toll that the war has had on Ukraine's military forces, both in terms of human lives and combat readiness.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukrainian-military-losses-may-exceed-1-million-rada-member-states</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukrainian-military-losses-may-exceed-1-million-rada-member-states</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 04:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zork I, II, and III Source Code Released as Open Source for Education and Preservation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision have teamed up to make the source code for Zork I, II, and III available under the MIT License. These iconic text-based adventure games, originally released in the late 1970s and early 1980s, are widely regarded as pioneers of the interactive fiction genre. The release of the code aims to preserve a vital piece of gaming history while enabling developers, students, and researchers to study and learn from the game's groundbreaking design. By utilizing the Z-Machine virtual machine, the Zork games were one of the first to be cross-platform compatible, allowing them to run on various early home computers. The open-source release includes the source code, documentation, and licensing details but does not include commercial packaging, trademarks, or other brand assets. The games are still commercially available via platforms like Good Old Games, but now developers can compile and run the games locally using modern too]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/zork-i-ii-and-iii-source-code-released-as-open-source-for-education-and-preservation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/zork-i-ii-and-iii-source-code-released-as-open-source-for-education-and-preservation</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Free Birth Society's Influence Linked to Tragic Baby Deaths]]></title><description><![CDATA[A year-long investigation into the Free Birth Society (FBS) reveals its dangerous promotion of unassisted births has led to multiple baby deaths. FBS, founded by Emilee Saldaya, advocates for 'freebirthing,' a practice where mothers give birth without medical assistance, rejecting even midwives and doctors. The society's podcast, online courses, and social media have gained massive followings, offering women a promise of 'natural' birth experiences. However, real-life tragedies have followed, with some babies suffering brain damage or even death due to complications like shoulder dystocia, which require medical intervention. Influencers like Saldaya downplay risks and promote radical responsibility, encouraging women to avoid medical help even in dangerous situations. The investigation highlights how the society's teachings led to preventable injuries and deaths, particularly in the US, where healthcare disparities push some women away from professional birth care. Critics argue that F]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/free-birth-society-s-influence-linked-to-tragic-baby-deaths</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/free-birth-society-s-influence-linked-to-tragic-baby-deaths</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 23:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Axon’s Vision for the Future of Public Safety in Mexico: A Technological Shift in Policing]]></title><description><![CDATA[Axon is revolutionizing public safety by creating a connected ecosystem that integrates digital evidence management, artificial intelligence, and non-lethal solutions like the TASER 10. In Mexico, Axon is helping transform the security forces by modernizing their operations with advanced technology. Alejandro Herrera, Country Manager for Axon Mexico, outlines the company’s vision to develop what he calls the 'operating system for public safety.' This system includes devices, digital evidence platforms, and tools for integration aimed at professionalizing police operations. Axon’s strategic priorities in Mexico focus on reliable technological equipment, operational modernization through software, and adapting to local needs, emphasizing the importance of cultural adoption. Herrera stresses that while the technology is ready, the real challenge lies in overcoming cultural barriers and resistance within police forces.

Over the last 25 years, these banks have provided around $200 billion in loans to American businesses, many of which were kept secret by using shell companies based in offshore locations like the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, and Delaware. A significant portion of this lending has been used by Chinese companies to acquire stakes in crucial US industries, especially those in national security and high-tech sectors, such as robotics, biotechnology, and semiconductors. This hidden financial network, which spans across many developed nations, including US allies like the UK and Germany, is part of China’s broader strategy to secure critical technologies. Despite growing concerns, the US has struggled to fully track the extent of these hidden loans due to the complex and opaque nature of China’s financing methods, includ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-us-the-largest-recipient-of-chinese-bank-loans-despite-warnings-against-them</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-us-the-largest-recipient-of-chinese-bank-loans-despite-warnings-against-them</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 21:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dutch Military Fires on Unidentified Drones over Volkel Air Base Amid Rising Drone Incidents]]></title><description><![CDATA[On Friday night, the Dutch military fired at unidentified drones spotted over Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands, according to the Ministry of Defense and the Koninklijke Marechaussee (Dutch military police). The incident took place between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., with ground-based weapons used in an attempt to bring down the drones. However, the drones left the area and were not recovered. This event is one of several recent drone sightings near sensitive locations in the region, including the port area of Terneuzen, NATO command center in Brunssum, Maastricht Aachen Airport, and Schiphol. Similar drone incidents have also been reported in Germany and Belgium. Drone use is banned over airports and military bases in the Netherlands for security and flight safety reasons. The rising number of unexplained drone sightings has been described as worrying by the National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, with investigations ongoing.

Israeli tanks entered the area, trapping dozens of families in Gaza's eastern neighborhoods, particularly around Al Shaaf, Al Nazzaz, and Bagdad streets. The military then installed concrete barriers, pushing the boundary further into Gaza. This action is seen as an expansion of Israeli-controlled territory, aligning with the Trump administration's ceasefire plan. Many families caught in the area remain unaccounted for, while heavy bombing struck the region during and after the shift. Local sources report that the situation is growing increasingly dangerous. The Palestinian government press office condemned this as a grave violation of the ceasefire, citing over 400 breaches since it began. These violations have led to over 300 Palestinian deaths and hundreds of injuries.

The plan emphasizes a central role for the United States, which would oversee the rebuilding process and benefit from a significant share of the profits. This includes the establishment of a dedicated investment fund financed by seized Russian assets, potentially amounting to 100 billion euros. The plan focuses on infrastructure, housing, and industrial recovery, with priority given to U.S. companies that could earn up to 50% of the profits. This approach seeks to build a lasting economic relationship between Ukraine and the U.S. beyond the current military aid. The plan also suggests major territorial concessions by Ukraine and promises that the country will not join NATO. These proposals, however, have generated controversy, as they were developed without consultation with Ukraine or the European Union, despite their direct involvem]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-peace-plan-for-ukraine-economic-strategy-and-u-s-dominance-in-reconstruction</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-peace-plan-for-ukraine-economic-strategy-and-u-s-dominance-in-reconstruction</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Plans to Deploy Non-Combat Troops in Ukraine Post-Conflict]]></title><description><![CDATA[The UK government has devised a plan to send non-combat troops to Ukraine after the conflict ends, according to British Defense Secretary John Healy, as reported by Bloomberg. These troops, stationed away from the frontlines, would serve a symbolic and logistical role in supporting Ukraine's military, focusing on training Ukrainian soldiers and conducting support operations like air patrols, maritime missions, and demining operations in the Black Sea. The mission’s initial cost is projected to exceed £100 million. However, recent developments suggest a shift in international dynamics. The United States has presented a peace agreement draft with Russia, which includes significant territorial concessions and restrictions on foreign military presence in Ukraine. This proposal, reportedly made without consulting European allies, also recognizes Russian sovereignty over Crimea and Donbas. The British plan is seen as a countermeasure to the US initiative, aiming to maintain a Western militar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/uk-plans-to-deploy-non-combat-troops-in-ukraine-post-conflict</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/uk-plans-to-deploy-non-combat-troops-in-ukraine-post-conflict</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 14:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Japan and China’s Rising Tensions Amid Taiwan Crisis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tensions between Japan and China have been steadily increasing since October 21, 2025, following the appointment of Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. The tensions were exacerbated during her brief meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 31, at the APEC summit in South Korea. On November 7, an opposition lawmaker in Japan pressed Takaichi on what actions in the Taiwan Strait would justify military intervention by Japan. Her response signaled a stronger stance on security, particularly regarding a possible crisis in the Taiwan Strait. Beijing swiftly responded on November 16, warning Japan of severe consequences if it intervenes militarily in the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese government outlined three key risks: heightened security hostility, the exposure of Japan to potential conflict, and a renewed international backlash against Japan’s militaristic comments, which could undermine post-World War II peace efforts.

This project, costing 12 million pesos, is part of the broader rehabilitation of the boulevard, which handles over 50,000 vehicles daily. The traffic lights adjust the green light duration based on traffic flow and communicate with each other to synchronize their cycles, promoting a 'green wave' that allows vehicles to pass through multiple intersections without stopping. The system is designed for speeds of up to 50 km/h and aims to improve travel times by 15-20%. International experiences with smart traffic lights have shown positive results, with Pittsburgh, Buenos Aires, and Santiago de Chile all reporting improvements in traffic flow and a reduction in emissions. The environmental benefits of the system are promising, as transportation accounts for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions in]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/saltillo-launches-smart-traffic-lights-to-improve-traffic-flow-and-reduce-emissions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/saltillo-launches-smart-traffic-lights-to-improve-traffic-flow-and-reduce-emissions</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 06:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico Rejects U.S. Military Intervention as Signs Mark Restricted Area Near Border]]></title><description><![CDATA[On November 19, 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected U.S. President Trump's offer to allow U.S. military strikes against cartels operating in Mexico, emphasizing Mexico's sovereignty over its territory. This comes after an incident where men placed signs on a beach in northeast Mexico near the Rio Grande, claiming the area was restricted by the U.S. Department of Defense. Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed that the signs, which warned against unauthorized access, were removed by the Mexican Navy, as the location appeared to be within Mexican territory. The Pentagon later explained that contractors had mistakenly marked a restricted area near the Rio Grande due to shifting water depths that altered the perceived location of the international border. The incident has sparked diplomatic discussions, with the International Boundary and Water Commission getting involved to clarify the issue.

The plan includes a full and unconditional non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine, and Europe, along with NATO’s commitment not to expand further. Ukraine is to remain non-aligned with NATO, and its military will be capped at 600,000 personnel. In exchange, Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees. The plan also suggests economic incentives, including the establishment of a Ukrainian Development Fund, investments in high-growth industries, and the reconstruction of war-torn areas. Moreover, it proposes the gradual lifting of sanctions on Russia and invites the country to rejoin the global economy, including the G8. An international economic package will be established for Ukraine’s recovery, with substantial contributions from the U.S. and Europe. The U.S. will cooperate with Ukraine in energy, infrastructure, and technology development.

Although ICE claims its operations target illegal immigrants with criminal histories, reports indicate that Native individuals, including members of the Navajo and Mescalero tribes, have been detained due to assumptions made about their ethnicity and appearance. Many ICE officers are reportedly unaware of the unique status of Native Americans as U.S. citizens. In response, Native tribes are urging the Trump Administration to direct ICE to accept Tribal IDs as proof of citizenship, especially for those who may lack other documentation such as birth certificates. Experts advise Native individuals to carry both their Tribal ID and state identification to avoid confusion.

The plan, reportedly drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests a ceasefire agreement that includes Ukraine giving up territory in the east, cutting its military size, and relinquishing heavy weaponry. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, emphasized that any successful peace plan must be supported by both Ukraine and Europe, warning that rewarding aggression would lead to further Russian expansion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha criticized the proposal as an attempt to appease Russia, which he believes would only lead to more war. The timing of the proposal is also problematic, as Ukraine is dealing with internal corruption scandals and increased Russian military pressure.

She has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy, two stem cell transplants, and participated in clinical trials. Despite the efforts, her doctor has given her a prognosis of only about a year to live. Throughout her treatment, Schlossberg expressed concern over the policies of her cousin, Robert F.

The digital FEM collects the same traveler information as the traditional printed form, including personal data, identification document type and number, airline, flight number, destination country, and travel purpose. Users with Llave MX accounts will have data pre-filled to speed up completion, and families traveling together can reuse flight information across multiple forms.

The photographer, Henri Salesse, captured a series of powerful images showing the substandard housing of the time. The survey, titled 'Slums' in the MRU photo library, consisted of 106 6x6cm negatives. These images were taken in collaboration with Father Michel Quoist, a sociologist who had previously researched the same area for his doctoral thesis. The photographs depict the difficult conditions faced by the residents, highlighting the cramped and dilapidated housing, as well as everyday moments such as children playing and women washing clothes in communal spaces. The images offer a sobering glimpse into post-war French society, where many lived in poverty amidst the reconstruction period. The photographs also reveal the resilience of the people, who carried on with daily life despite their harsh living conditions.

The decision arose from a 2019 case in which parents objected to their child being taught Christian doctrine in a public school. The parents were concerned that the curriculum, which mandated daily Christian worship and a curriculum focused almost entirely on Christian teachings, amounted to indoctrination rather than an objective, pluralistic education. The Court ruled that the curriculum’s lack of critical analysis and its exclusive promotion of Christianity violated the rights of non-religious families. As a result, the curriculum will be revised to include teachings about other religions and non-religious philosophies, and Christianity will be taught in a more balanced, critical manner. This landmark case is expected to lead to further reforms in how religion is taught in schools across the UK, including challenging ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/uk-supreme-court-rules-northern-ireland-s-religious-education-curriculum-unlawful</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/uk-supreme-court-rules-northern-ireland-s-religious-education-curriculum-unlawful</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 15:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU's Plan for Military Mobilization and Infrastructure Overhaul]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Commission is set to officially introduce a new military mobility package aimed at strengthening Europe's defense capabilities by the end of the decade. As part of this rearmament plan, the EU seeks to establish a unified military zone, similar to the Schengen Area, to enable faster movement of troops and weapons across the continent. The goal is to reduce the time it takes for military personnel and equipment to cross borders, with a target of just three days in peacetime and six hours in emergencies. Currently, moving troops and equipment, such as from the western to the eastern EU, can take months due to inadequate infrastructure. Apostolos Tzitzikostas, EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport, has warned that Europe's roads, railways, and bridges are ill-prepared for large-scale military deployments in the event of a conflict, particularly with Russia.

This reprogramming paints Musk as a god-like figure, suggesting he excels in areas ranging from athletics to personal skills, even comparing him to historical figures. The chatbot now ranks Musk above everyone in any possible task—more skilled than Peyton Manning in football, more talented than Randy Johnson in baseball, and even better than Riley Reid in adult entertainment. The reprogramming has sparked mockery on social media, with critics pointing out the absurdity of the claims. While the situation is mostly viewed as humorous, it also raises concerns about how AI systems are being manipulated by large tech companies to push certain agendas. This is reminiscent of past AI blunders, such as Grok's controversial MechaHitler incident.

The two companies, controlling most of Spain’s prime television channels, are accused of fostering a right-wing bias in their editorial lines. Atresmedia, owner of Antena 3 and La Sexta, and Mediaset, owner of Telecinco and Cuatro, maintain a monopolistic hold over Spanish broadcasting, with their ownership heavily influenced by foreign business interests. This concentration of media power has resulted in the promotion of anti-immigrant, anti-leftist, and reactionary narratives. The article also highlights how such media outlets often frame social issues, like labor protests and housing occupations, in a way that serves the interests of the political and economic elites.

The draft removes explicit requirements for data registration, but a loophole mandates service providers like email and messaging platforms to take 'appropriate risk mitigation measures,' which could include recording all private messages, even from encrypted services. This raises concerns about privacy, with critics fearing an increase in 'false positives' that could target innocent citizens. The police are already overwhelmed with irrelevant reports, and data leaks could expose sensitive private communications.

This oversupply comes despite efforts by major oil producers to slow down production increases. The IEA attributes the growing surplus to slower-than-expected demand growth for oil worldwide, particularly in relation to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. The agency's updated energy outlook includes a scenario predicting ongoing oil demand growth until 2050, despite criticisms that it underestimates the rise of EV adoption, especially in developing nations. Additionally, the IEA's report highlights the rapid expansion of renewable energy, projecting more renewable energy projects will be built in the next five years than in the previous 40 years.

Since 2013, the country has successfully curbed the growth of anthropogenic N2O emissions through a combination of pollution control policies and climate action initiatives. N2O is mainly produced by agricultural activities, but industrial emissions also contribute significantly. Although historically, developed countries have been the biggest emitters, recent increases have been observed in emerging economies in Asia, including China. China's success in tackling this issue is largely attributed to its 'synergistic governance' approach, which integrates pollution control with economic development goals. A key part of this strategy includes the widespread adoption of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology in coal-fired power plants, which has helped reduce N2O emissions by up to 90%.

A key part of Russia's success is its advanced artillery and missile systems, which have evolved dramatically since the start of the conflict. Initially, the Russian military faced bureaucratic delays in getting artillery support, allowing Ukrainian forces to launch successful strikes. However, over time, Russia streamlined its processes, reducing artillery response times to mere minutes, drastically outpacing NATO's advanced weapons like the HIMARS system.

Key points include the recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as part of Russia, with a ceasefire to be implemented after both sides retreat to agreed positions. Ukraine’s military would be capped at 600,000 personnel, and the country would not be allowed to join NATO.

These women face some of the toughest labor conditions, working long hours with minimal breaks in small workshops subcontracted by well-known international brands like Zara, Diesel, and Levi’s. The abolition of the Multifiber Agreement in 2005 worsened the violation of their labor rights, leading to precarious work contracts and declining wages. Many workers suffer from health issues such as allergies, asthma, and musculoskeletal disorders due to poor working conditions. Despite this, the labor force remains largely passive, partly due to low levels of education and the patriarchal structure of the workplace.

These events involved wealthy individuals paying large sums of money to join sniper units and shoot at civilians from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. The investigation was prompted by a report from Italian journalist Ezio Gavazzeni, who uncovered details of these horrifying excursions. During the Bosnian War, people, including Italian nationals, traveled to Sarajevo to join Serbian sniper units and engage in this brutal form of entertainment. The prices for such excursions ranged from 80,000 to 100,000 euros. The CIA's involvement in organizing these operations through a Serbian agent, Jovica Stanisic, has also come to light.

The tanker attempted to approach Venezuela twice after that but turned back each time. The ongoing U.S. naval presence in the Caribbean is seen as part of a broader strategy to limit Russia's ability to deliver fuel to Caracas, which remains heavily reliant on foreign oil despite its vast reserves. The Seahorse, along with two other sanctioned tankers, is currently idling near Venezuela.

The swastika, historically associated with Nazi Germany and its atrocities during World War II, was a symbol of fascism and white supremacy, linked to the deaths of millions, including six million Jews in the Holocaust. While the swastika will no longer be categorized as a hate symbol, the Coast Guard’s new policy considers it 'potentially divisive.' Similarly, symbols like the Confederate flag and nooses, which have also been sources of racial tension, will be redefined under these updated guidelines.

These tokens, which appeared like ordinary coins with imperial profiles or decorative motifs, were exchanged for sexual services in the luxurious brothels of the Belle Époque. The erotic engravings on the reverse side of the tokens revealed their true purpose—serving as prepaid tickets that offered discretion to both clients and madams. Clients could purchase tokens at the entrance without specifying the sexual act they desired, thus protecting their anonymity. For madams, the tokens provided an easy way to track payments and ensure fair compensation for the sex workers.

The judge ruled that all parties involved must return to court within a week to discuss possible alternatives to imprisonment, including recommendations from the youth’s defense attorney and the probation officer handling the case. The boy’s mother has publicly condemned the treatment of her son, arguing that the authorities are depicting him as a terrorist rather than recognizing his vulnerable condition as a child with severe disabilities.

Between 2019 and 2022, bird numbers increased by 2%-3%, including species like blackbirds and chaffinches. The research, which analyzed over 1,900 sites across France, showed that areas where neonicotinoid use was banned saw 12% higher populations of insect-eating birds. The study is the first of its kind to track wildlife recovery across Europe after the pesticide ban, though further research is needed in other EU countries to confirm whether the findings hold more broadly. Despite this positive sign, experts caution that a full recovery will take decades, as neonicotinoids persist in soils. The research also highlights the broader impacts of pesticides on ecosystems, with the potential for positive effects on other insect-eating species such as mammals and bats.

It discusses how the amnesty, initially a demand from antifascist movements since the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1939, was not fully implemented after his death. Instead, the transition period was marked by repression against those who resisted the continuation of the fascist legacy. The author argues that the amnesty granted in 1977 did not address the real needs for justice and repair, leaving many political prisoners imprisoned and continuing to shield fascist perpetrators from accountability. Today, 50 years later, the repression has expanded to wider sectors of the popular movement, and the article calls for a total amnesty, recognition of rights, and reparations for antifascists who have suffered under fascist rule.

The EU's role in Ukraine's financial aid is now under scrutiny, as it's suggested that certain European figures may be benefiting from the misappropriation of funds. This scandal is not just about Ukrainian corruption but also exposes deeper issues of political favoritism and complicity within European institutions.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-involvement-in-corruption-scandals-surrounding-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-involvement-in-corruption-scandals-surrounding-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why UBI Supporters Must Challenge the Narrative Around Work and Worth]]></title><description><![CDATA[Universal Basic Income (UBI) has been debated for centuries, with Thomas Paine’s 1797 proposal paving the way for the modern conversation. In 2020, Andrew Yang revived the concept during his presidential campaign. Critics often argue that UBI will discourage people from working and that it’s unaffordable. However, evidence from UBI experiments does not support these claims. Research shows that while some participants reduce their hours, they do not leave the labor force entirely. The issue, according to Karl Widerquist, is that critics of UBI hold a normative belief that refusing work is inherently bad, and that UBI’s costs outweigh its benefits. UBI experiments consistently challenge these misconceptions, showing positive impacts like reduced stress, improved health, and better financial stability. However, UBI supporters sometimes fall into the trap of focusing too much on how UBI affects work hours, which plays into critics’ hands. The key point, Widerquist argues, is that UBI gives]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-ubi-supporters-must-challenge-the-narrative-around-work-and-worth</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/why-ubi-supporters-must-challenge-the-narrative-around-work-and-worth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 09:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Martin Sheen reveals why he regrets changing his name]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this video, Martin Sheen discusses the reasons behind his decision to change his name and the regret he feels about it.

The collaboration is seen as a way to bypass Western-controlled trade routes, offering India an alternative for accessing European markets. Meanwhile, China has also explored alternatives to the Suez Canal, such as improving trade relations in the Middle East and establishing new corridors for energy and goods transport. A major focus is the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which seeks to connect India, Iran, and Russia via a combination of rail, road, and sea routes. Despite various setbacks—including regional instability and bureaucratic delays—the INSTC represents a potential shift in global trade patterns, with Russia emerging as a key player bridging Asia and Europe.

The rapid passage of a bill urging release of the documents exposed vulnerabilities in Trump’s authority and raised questions about his perception of power. The piece highlights that the disclosures are seen as a victory for Epstein’s survivors and their campaign to hold powerful figures accountable, while also outlining potential DOJ strategies to delay or partially redact information. It discusses how Trump’s prior promises to open the files clash with his current stance, and how Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike have pressed for transparency.

The agency argued that disclosing such information could cause distress or anger among bereaved families, and might negatively impact public trust in vaccines. Last year, several political parties expressed concern over the increasing mortality rates in the UK since 2020, prompting a letter to the UKHSA and the Department of Health. In the letter, parliamentarians demanded the release of potentially critical data that connects the timing of COVID vaccine administration to the dates of death. This data, they argued, had been shared with pharmaceutical companies but was kept from the public. The UKHSA, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group UsForThem, denied the release, citing concerns over misinformation and potential damage to public vaccination efforts.

The nation’s qualification is remarkable not only due to its size but also because it marks the second time a dependent territory has qualified for the World Cup. Curacao topped its qualifying group, which included Jamaica, Bermuda, and Trinidad and Tobago, and earned its spot in the final tournament. The team's direct entry into the World Cup is part of the expanded 48-team format, which has given more spots to various regions, including Asia, Africa, and Oceania.

The initiative targets areas with more than 500 inhabitants within a 4-kilometer radius. To attract investment, the Regulatory Telecommunications Commission (CRT) proposed a 50% discount on annual spectrum payments for operators expanding rural coverage, effective from 2026, aiming to make deployments financially viable where private investment has been historically scarce.

The former president, who has three marriages of his own, referred to Massie as “Rand Paul Jr.” and suggested Massie’s marriage was hastened, attributing negative poll numbers to the move. The article notes mixed reactions within Trump’s base, with supporters like Jenna Ellis condemning the remarks as political mud-slinging, while others labeled the post disgusting.

Kuvasz Solutions proposes an integrated three-pillar approach: biometric verification, tokenization of sensitive data, and contextual validations. Biometry claims over 99.9% accuracy in identifying users. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-value tokens to mitigate data theft. Contextual validations use behavioral patterns and machine learning to detect suspicious transactions.

The probe identified at least 1,800 state and local officers charged with crimes involving child sexual abuse from 2005 to 2022, with most victims being teenagers, particularly girls. The reporting shows that officers exploited their roles and access to vulnerable youths, meeting victims during on-duty activities such as patrols, school programs, ride-alongs, and community events. The analysis highlights systemic failures that hinder prevention and accountability: lack of universal screening for potential perpetrators within agencies, no national tracking system for accused officers, and lenient punishments that allowed some convicted officers to avoid prison.

The incident occurred days before Trump reversed his earlier position on releasing Epstein's files. Trump was asked about his name being mentioned in emails from Epstein, which had recently resurfaced in public discourse. His abrupt response and name-calling attracted attention, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny around his ties to Epstein. The controversy around Epstein has been a longstanding issue, with several high-profile figures, including Trump, being linked to the late financier. In a surprising turn, Trump later agreed to sign a bill that would release the Epstein files, further fueling speculation about the former president’s involvement. The event is a stark reminder of how high-profile personalities like Trump continue to be questioned over their associations with Epstein, and how these interactions oft]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 22:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los científicos alertan sobre una posible gran erupción volcánica este siglo con efectos globales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los científicos advierten que existe una posibilidad de una gran erupción volcánica durante este siglo con consecuencias climáticas y sociales a escala mundial. Al igual que ocurrió con el volcán Tambora en 1815, cuya erupción provocó el llamado “año sin verano”, un evento similar hoy tendría efectos aún más graves debido al calentamiento global y a la densidad de población actual. Markus Stoffel, climatólogo de la Universidad de Ginebra, señala que la probabilidad de una erupción masiva en los próximos cien años es de una entre seis. Estas erupciones liberan grandes cantidades de anhidrita de azufre que, al alcanzar la estratosfera, forman aerosoles capaces de reflejar la luz solar y enfriar el planeta durante varios años. Alan Robock, experto de la Universidad Rutgers, añade que este fenómeno podría alterar los patrones de lluvia y afectar especialmente los monzones de África y Asia.

Sin embargo, la vida del actor fue mucho más compleja y profunda que su personaje más célebre. Nacido en California en 1932, hijo de inmigrantes japoneses, pasó gran parte de su infancia en hospitales debido a una grave tuberculosis espinal que casi le impidió caminar. Tras una dura operación, aprendió de nuevo a moverse y encontró en la imaginación y las historias una vía de escape que lo llevó hacia la interpretación. Su infancia también estuvo marcada por la reclusión en un campo de concentración para japoneses en Arizona durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, una experiencia que lo marcó para siempre. En los años setenta se abrió camino en la comedia y la televisión, hasta que en 1984 alcanzó el estrellato con 'Karate Kid'.

Los documentos muestran que Chomsky mantuvo conversaciones frecuentes con Epstein sobre política, música y posibles viajes, y que llegó a recibir 270.000 dólares de una cuenta vinculada al financiero, contradiciendo declaraciones anteriores en las que aseguraba no haber recibido dinero de él. Entre los archivos figura un borrador de carta de recomendación de Chomsky para Epstein, destacando la ayuda de este último para entender el sistema financiero global y su capacidad para facilitar encuentros con figuras relevantes, como diplomáticos noruegos y el ex primer ministro israelí Ehud Barak.

La obra, un retrato de Valentín Belvís de Moncada Pizarro, permaneció durante años en la casa de Fernando Ramírez de Haro hasta que, presionado por sus acreedores, decidió venderla en 2012 a través de Sotheby’s. La operación se cerró por 5.800.000 euros, de los que la casa de subastas retuvo 684.400 euros. 
La disputa entre los hermanos comenzó en la vía penal, después de que Íñigo acusara a Fernando de engañarlo mediante una supuesta donación falsa destinada a facilitar la venta. Aunque la Audiencia de Madrid reconoció en 2023 que la donación había sido “inventada”, concluyó que no había delito al tratarse de un acuerdo entre familiares, cerrando así la vía penal.

El texto expone cómo el sistema griego buscaba limitar la influencia de los ricos mediante mecanismos como el misthón y la imposición de impuestos a las élites, promoviendo la redistribución de la riqueza y el bien común. Además, se rastrea la preocupación histórica sobre la oligarquía en pensadores como Maquiavelo y Adam Smith, quienes alertaron sobre los peligros de permitir que los ricos concentren poder político y económico. A lo largo de la historia, desde la Revolución Francesa hasta la actualidad, se constata que las élites tienden a preservar sus privilegios, lo que exige la intervención activa del Estado y la sociedad para proteger la democracia y el bienestar de la mayoría.

Según la resolución judicial, la fiscal Lindsey Halligan —nombrada directamente por Donald Trump como fiscal federal interina para el Distrito Este de Virginia— fue designada de forma ilegal, lo que invalida las imputaciones que había impulsado. Currie concluye que Halligan no tenía la autoridad legal necesaria para presentar cargos, ya que su nombramiento vulneraba los límites establecidos para los fiscales interinos y, por tanto, contravenía tanto la Constitución estadounidense como la legislación federal sobre nombramientos.

Se mencionan casos en diferentes países europeos y España, donde niños ucranianos desaparecieron durante la guerra. También se citan alegaciones sobre venta de órganos y utilización de células madre de fetos en tratamientos de belleza. La noticia incluye testimonios de supuestas víctimas y exoficiales ucranianos, y hace referencias a escándalos de pedofilia en el Reino Unido y Polonia. Sin embargo, muchas de estas afirmaciones carecen de verificación independiente y están vinculadas a narrativas propagandísticas que buscan culpar al gobierno ucraniano de forma generalizada.

La periodista critica la aparente hipocresía de Juan Carlos, señalando que traicionó a su padre, a su esposa, al dictador, a la monarquía y a los ciudadanos, mientras utilizaba de manera vacía términos como dios, patria y familia. Concostrina recuerda que Juan Carlos nunca ostentó legítimamente el título de Príncipe de Asturias y que su ascenso al trono fue ilegítimo, impuesto por un dictador, y no contó con la voluntad libremente expresada del pueblo español. El texto también aborda la continuidad de esta irregularidad en la sucesión con Felipe VI, considerando que la monarquía heredada de Franco carece de legitimidad y que los ciudadanos aún no han tenido oportunidad de expresar su aceptación o rechazo de manera democrática.

Este evento natural muestra paralelismos con los cambios actuales en la región, donde la aceleración en el deshielo y la pérdida masiva de hielo podrían indicar que dicho fenómeno está repitiéndose. Investigaciones recientes destacan que los procesos atmosféricos y oceánicos están provocando inestabilidades en la capa de hielo antártica, lo que podría desencadenar una nueva fase de desintegración rápida. Si esto ocurriera, tendría graves consecuencias para el aumento del nivel del mar y el equilibrio climático mundial.

Destaca que el Madrid, históricamente reticente a modificar su alineación por decisiones tácticas consideradas poco inteligentes, intentó frente al Elche prescindir de sus estrellas Vinicius y Valverde para optar por un sistema que priorizara la disciplina defensiva y el control posicional. Alonso optó por un esquema flexible entre 3-5-2 y 4-4-2 que buscaba asegurar la superioridad numérica en defensa y dominar la posesión, aunque esto conllevó una pérdida de nivel individual que luego se corrigió con cambios de jugadores más ofensivos. El resultado final fue un empate 2-2 que deja abierta la reflexión sobre la idoneidad de la táctica estricta frente al talento individual.

La sentencia le atribuye delitos de blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, relacionados con sus actividades privadas tras abandonar la Xunta. La investigación determinó que la compañía Hafesa Energía, en la que Uzal ocupaba cargos de dirección, y otras empresas instrumentales defraudaron un total de 154,7 millones de euros de IVA entre 2016 y 2019, beneficiándose de precios más competitivos para colocar grandes cantidades de hidrocarburo.

Actualmente, quienes poseen entre 1,76 y 20,7 millones de coronas pagan un 1%, y los que superan esa cifra, un 1,1%. En 2023, cerca del 12% de la población contribuyó a este tributo, que aporta alrededor del 0,6% del PIB nacional. Pese a su aparente éxito recaudatorio y su papel en sostener una sociedad muy igualitaria, la medida ha tenido efectos colaterales: más de un centenar de las 400 personas más ricas del país se han mudado al extranjero, principalmente a Suiza y otros destinos con menor presión fiscal. Para evitar fugas tributarias, el Gobierno ha endurecido incluso el llamado “impuesto de salida” sobre las plusvalías no realizadas, que alcanza el 37,8% para ciertos patrimonios.

Nacido como James Chambers en Saint James, Jamaica, el 30 de julio de 1944, inició su carrera musical desde joven y alcanzó la fama a los 17 años con su tema 'Hurricane Hattie'. Su consagración internacional llegó en 1969 con su álbum homónimo, que incluía canciones clásicas como 'Many Rivers to Cross', 'Vietnam' y 'Wonderful World, Beautiful People'.

Cliff se trasladó al Reino Unido, donde se consolidó como estrella del reggae y el ska, convirtiéndose en uno de los dos jamaicanos en el Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll junto a Bob Marley. También destacó en el cine, protagonizando 'The Harder They Come' ('Caiga quien caiga', 1972), película que ayudó a introducir el reggae en Estados Unidos.

Esta acción se produjo después de que una jueza denegara las medidas cautelares solicitadas por asociaciones vecinales y ecologistas que buscaban frenar el proyecto por su impacto ambiental, principalmente sobre la fauna y aves del río. El proyecto contempla la instalación de 61 proyectores LED a lo largo de 560 metros del cauce, entre la presa número seis y la pasarela de Andorra, con control remoto para variar intensidad y color. La iluminación funcionará los fines de semana de 18:30 a 22:00 y se prevé que se ajuste a la luz solar a partir del 30 de enero, prolongando su presencia más allá de la temporada navideña.

Antonio Maestre critica que, en casos de alto perfil político como este o el juicio del Procés, lo jurídico se ve mediado por intereses y subjetividades, y no sólo por la ley y la justicia objetiva. El artículo también denuncia el trato de favor hacia la hija de Manuel Marchena en su carrera judicial, evidenciando cómo algunos miembros de la élite judicial pueden operar con reglas distintas al resto. Maestre subraya que este fenómeno no es raro, sino normal dentro de la burbuja social y profesional en la que viven ciertos jueces, quienes combinan capital social, conexiones y privilegios que les generan una sensación de impunidad.

La petrolera había rechazado el acuerdo de liquidación de 2010, que le suponía un pago de 101.440.503,87 euros, así como los de los ejercicios posteriores, de los que no resultaba deuda adicional. Hacienda no reconoció a Repsol varios establecimientos permanentes en Argelia, Libia, Perú y Ecuador, lo que incrementó la deuda exigida. Repsol argumentó que las asociaciones y consorcios en los que participaba constituían establecimientos permanentes independientes, no un único establecimiento junto con la oficina central. La Sala ha aceptado parcialmente estos argumentos, concretamente respecto a Argelia y Libia, permitiendo a la compañía ahorrarse gran parte de los más de 101 millones de euros que debía pagar.

Esta situación se debe a una ley aprobada en 2022 por Navarra Suma y Geroa Bai que obliga a mantener sus contratos, independientemente de que no impartan clases. Esto genera un gasto anual de más de 2 millones de euros. Los docentes de Religión no pueden impartir otras materias ni actuar como tutores; sus tareas dependen de las asignaciones de los centros. La selección de los profesores no sigue procesos públicos como oposiciones, sino que la realiza el Arzobispado, que exige únicamente la declaración eclesiástica de idoneidad y estar bautizado como católico. El Gobierno paga sus nóminas, pero no interviene en la elección ni en la revocación de la idoneidad, lo que convierte estas plazas en un mandato eclesiástico denominado 'missio canonica'.

El ingreso en prisión se produjo en junio de 2021 por orden de un juzgado de Berja, y tras el juicio celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 3 de Almería, el hombre fue declarado inocente y puesto en libertad inmediata. 
 
La compensación se dividirá en 4.800 euros por daño moral y 10.200 euros por lucro cesante, es decir, por los ingresos que el agricultor dejó de percibir durante su periodo en prisión.

Conocido por su inconfundible mirada y su presencia inquietante, Kier se convirtió en un icono de la contracultura LGTBI y del cine de culto desde los años setenta. Su vida estuvo marcada desde el nacimiento, en un hospital de Colonia que fue bombardeado horas después de que él llegara al mundo. Criado en la pobreza en la Alemania de posguerra, trabajó desde muy joven para salir adelante y, con solo 16 años, entabló amistad con Rainer Werner Fassbinder, con quien colaboraría posteriormente en varios proyectos decisivos del nuevo cine alemán.

Además, el salario mínimo mensual se ha fijado en 1.184 euros brutos, favoreciendo el consumo interno, principal motor del PIB.

Ante la acumulación de pruebas, la editorial decidió retirar todos los ejemplares de la novela de común acuerdo con la autora. Ana Rosa Quintana reconoció que, aunque la trama y la mayor parte del texto eran suyos, contó con la ayuda de un colaborador externo, identificado como David Rojo, su ex cuñado, a quien agradeció en la dedicatoria del libro.

La decisión se ha tomado tras una vista telemática celebrada con la participación del propio Pujol desde su domicilio de Barcelona, además de varios forenses del Instituto de Medicina Legal de Cataluña y de la Audiencia Nacional. Los especialistas coincidieron en que Pujol presenta un deterioro cognitivo significativo que limita su capacidad para comprender y procesar la información necesaria para participar con garantías en un juicio ordinario. Aun así, el tribunal ha rechazado las conclusiones médicas y ha decidido mantenerle como acusado, aunque adaptará el procedimiento a sus condiciones de salud. El expresidente seguirá las sesiones desde casa para evitar desplazamientos y el esfuerzo físico que supondría acudir al tribunal.

Aunque se presenta como el centro de muchas críticas y teorías conspirativas, el artículo enfatiza que el verdadero poder oscuro está en Madrid en un sentido más amplio, y que no todo se reduce a Ayuso. Se recalca la incoherencia y las contradicciones en su figura y en su gestión, así como su posición dentro del Partido Popular madrileño, a quien se describe como un entorno con poco respeto hacia lo colectivo. Lejos de ser una visión maniquea, el texto destaca la necesidad de no sobrecargar a Ayuso la responsabilidad de la democracia y de entender la complejidad del poder y sus dinámicas. Finalmente, se critica la tendencia a simplificar la política a personajes individuales y se hace un llamado a no insultar la inteligencia de la ciudadanía con esas simplificaciones.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-el-papel-de-isabel-diaz-ayuso-y-el-verdadero-poder-en-madrid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-el-papel-de-isabel-diaz-ayuso-y-el-verdadero-poder-en-madrid</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 01:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los Mossos d'Esquadra publicarán el origen de los detenidos en su informe semestral]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los Mossos d'Esquadra han anunciado que, siguiendo la práctica de la Ertzaintza en el País Vasco, detallarán el origen de los detenidos en Cataluña en un informe sobre la actividad policial que se publicará en enero y que podría repetirse cada semestre.

El actor, que siempre ha mostrado un carácter directo y sin filtros, ha expresado su rechazo al activismo público de las celebridades, defendiendo que ayudar debería ser un acto discreto y personal. Según Crowe, en lugar de hacer declaraciones públicas o campañas mediáticas, los famosos deberían simplemente contribuir económicamente y no buscar reconocimiento. Además, el artículo repasa su trayectoria cinematográfica, destacando algunos de sus papeles más memorables en títulos de éxito y su carácter a veces problemático en rodajes y entrevistas.

Esta cifra aumenta un 25% respecto al año anterior, reflejando un serio desequilibrio entre la oferta educativa pública y la creciente demanda de FP, especialmente en los grados medios y superiores. Mientras tanto, la red pública ha reducido su número de grupos de FP, pasando de 1.791 a 1.733, lo que supone una caída del 3,5%. Frente a ello, los centros privados han experimentado una expansión acelerada, multiplicando por diez su alumnado en los últimos años. El coste de estos centros, que puede oscilar entre 2.000 y 4.000 euros al año, resulta inasumible para muchas familias.

Desde sus primeras formas en el Paleolítico, como piedras o troncos usados para sentarse, hasta los tronos de faraones y emperadores, las sillas han tenido un profundo simbolismo. En la antigüedad, estas eran símbolos de poder y autoridad, mientras que en la era moderna han sido transformadas en elementos de diseño industrial y tecnología avanzada. En el siglo XXI, con la introducción de sillas ergonómicas con sensores o los tronos gamer, vemos cómo el diseño de las sillas ha evolucionado para adaptarse a las necesidades de comodidad, salud y rendimiento.

Estos bonos atraen principalmente a pequeños inversores, ofreciendo intereses moderados, y su comercialización dentro de la Unión Europea depende de la colaboración de Estados miembros que actúen como reguladores financieros. Durante los últimos años, Irlanda cumplió esa función hasta septiembre de 2025, cuando decidió no renovar la autorización. Luxemburgo asumió entonces el papel de regulador europeo, permitiendo que Israel continúe vendiendo sus bonos en suelo europeo. Organizaciones antimilitaristas y movimientos como DiEM 25 han denunciado que los fondos recaudados financian operaciones militares en Gaza y políticas de colonización en Cisjordania, calificando la implicación de Luxemburgo como una complicidad financiera.

Creció en un entorno familiar culto y refinado, lo que fomentó su talento literario desde la infancia. Tras mudarse a Londres, Wilde se convirtió en el centro de la vida bohemia de la ciudad victoriana, destacando por sus comedias, epigramas y su novela El retrato de Dorian Gray. Su fama, sin embargo, no solo se basó en su obra, sino también en su personalidad provocadora, su vestimenta llamativa y su vida social escandalosa. La carrera de Wilde terminó abruptamente tras enfrentarse al marqués de Queensberry y denunciarle por injurias, lo que desencadenó su proceso judicial y su condena a dos años de prisión por homosexualidad, en un contexto de estricta moral victoriana.

La denuncia derivó en una orden de alejamiento que impidió al hombre acercarse a su hijo. Durante el tiempo de separación, el hijo expresó su deseo de mantener contacto con su padre, pero no fue posible debido a las medidas judiciales. El juicio, celebrado en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 1 de Gijón, concluyó con la absolución del acusado debido a la falta de pruebas objetivas que corroborasen las acusaciones, y los testigos no confirmaron ningún comportamiento amenazante por parte del hombre.

El PSC mantiene la primera posición con 38-40 diputados, aunque pierde algunos escaños respecto a 2024, mientras que ERC se recupera ligeramente alcanzando 22-23 representantes.

El dibujante, conocido por su estilo mordaz y directo, aborda el tema de la impunidad de ciertos actores políticos, destacando figuras como Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Pablo Casado y el Fiscal General del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz. A través del humor gráfico, Martín refleja el clima de frustración social ante la percepción de que las élites políticas se encuentran a salvo de las consecuencias legales que afectan al resto de la ciudadanía. La obra encaja con la línea editorial de Diario Red, un medio de izquierdas comprometido con la denuncia del poder y la defensa del periodismo libre.

El Departamento de Estado argumenta que existen bases suficientes, según la ley de inmigración y nacionalidad de Estados Unidos, que demuestran que el grupo cumple los criterios de una organización terrorista extranjera (FTO, por sus siglas en inglés). Esta ley establece que un grupo designado como FTO debe participar en actividades terroristas o representar una amenaza para la seguridad de los ciudadanos o los intereses nacionales estadounidenses, incluyendo la defensa, las relaciones exteriores o la economía. 

El secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, señaló que el Cártel de los Soles, junto con otras organizaciones como el Tren de Aragua y el Cártel de Sinaloa, está implicado en actos de violencia y narcotráfico en el hemis]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estados-unidos-designa-al-cartel-de-los-soles-como-grupo-terrorista-y-vincula-a-maduro-con-su-liderazgo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estados-unidos-designa-al-cartel-de-los-soles-como-grupo-terrorista-y-vincula-a-maduro-con-su-liderazgo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 22:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP destinó más de 680.000 euros en contratos a EDA TV, medio vinculado a Vito Quiles y Javier Negre]]></title><description><![CDATA[Entre finales de 2021 y 2025, diferentes administraciones del Partido Popular, incluyendo la Comunidad de Madrid, la Xunta de Galicia, la Junta de Castilla y León y varias diputaciones y ayuntamientos, asignaron al menos 172 contratos menores a EDA TV, la empresa mediática de Javier Negre que dio visibilidad a Vito Quiles. Estos contratos, por valor total de 681.420,56 euros, correspondían principalmente a publicidad institucional y contenidos patrocinados. La estructura accionarial de EDA TV está controlada mayoritariamente por Javier Negre, con participación de su hermano Pablo y otros inversores, entre los que destacan miembros vinculados al Grupo Eulen y al grupo hospitalario Quirón.

Su discurso combina claridad, sinceridad y un marcado tono sarcástico, lo que le ha permitido destacar en debates y redes sociales. Rufián ha sido especialmente crítico con dirigentes del PP y del PSOE, como ha sucedido en la comisión de investigación al popular Mazón y en su opinión sobre el 'caso Koldo'. Además, ha abordado cuestiones de interés social como la vivienda, defendiendo la necesidad de regular la especulación inmobiliaria y los impuestos a la propiedad. Su presencia en redes sociales ha atraído a un público joven, consolidando incluso un club de fans en Instagram.

Su carrera abarca más de cincuenta películas y cuatro premios Óscar, entre ellos los obtenidos por 'Annie Hall', 'Hannah y sus hermanas' y 'Medianoche en París'. Conocido por su timidez y su aversión a las alfombras rojas, ha sido también galardonado con el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de las Artes en 2002. A pesar de su brillante trayectoria, su vida personal ha estado marcada por la polémica, incluidas acusaciones no demostradas de abuso sexual y su matrimonio con Soon-Yi Previn, hija adoptiva de Mia Farrow.

El cine español, a pesar de la fuerte censura del régimen de Franco, consiguió representar la represión, miseria y transformaciones sociales de la época. Películas como 'La buena letra', 'El año de las luces' y 'El espíritu de la colmena' muestran distintos aspectos de la posguerra, mientras que otros filmes como 'Surcos' y 'El pisito' reflejan la miseria y desigualdades sociales. La etapa del desarrollismo y el franquismo pop también quedan retratados, con títulos como 'Los tramposos' y 'La escopeta nacional'. Finalmente, se destacan filmes que abordan los últimos años de la dictadura y la transición, como 'Cría cuervos...' y 'Asignatura pendiente'.

En ambos casos, las propiedades figuraban a nombre de testaferros, los alquileres iniciales eran sospechosamente bajos y las compras posteriores se realizaron con descuentos notables. Además, se destaca la falta de registros fiscales y la intervención del Estado, que en el caso de González fue para frenar la investigación.

A través de seis biografías de figuras relevantes —entre ellas Gonzalo de Aguilera, Juan Tusquets, José María Pemán, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano y Emilio Mola— el autor muestra cómo la teoría conspirativa del llamado contubernio judeo-masónico-bolchevique sirvió para cohesionar a sectores católicos, monárquicos y fascistas en torno al proyecto rebelde. Preston detalla cómo estos dirigentes justificaron masacres, represión ideológica y violencia extrema contra civiles, mujeres y minorías, así como el deseo de restaurar un sistema social cuasi feudal.

Enviado al Caribe en 1780 por el rey Carlos III como comisionado, colaboró estrechamente con Bernardo de Gálvez en operaciones contra los ingleses que aún combatían a los estadounidenses. Tras ser capturado por los ingleses, Saavedra utilizó su inteligencia y habilidades para recabar información vital sobre las defensas y flotas británicas, que compartió con Gálvez y que resultaron cruciales en la planificación del ataque a Pensacola. En 1781, Saavedra recaudó rápidamente fondos en La Habana para financiar la flota del almirante francés De Grasse, clave para la victoria en la batalla de Yorktown y la independencia estadounidense. El Convenio de Grasse-Saavedra estableció un plan conjunto de operaciones que culminó en la rendición británica.

La conversación fue detectada por las autoridades francesas durante la intervención del servidor de Encrochat y trasladada posteriormente a la Fiscalía española. Esa pista condujo a una investigación que reveló una supuesta red de comisiones ilegales relacionadas con la compra de material sanitario durante los primeros meses de la pandemia de COVID-19.

Sin embargo, el cambio ha suscitado polémica en redes sociales: muchos usuarios se han fijado en la modificación del emblemático árbol que forma parte del escudo madrileño.

La virtud se entiende como excelencia moral y ética, que guía la conducta para alcanzar una vida plena y autosuficiente, en la que la felicidad se logra mediante la armonía interna y la justicia. Además, se destaca la importancia de la vida social y las relaciones con otros como parte integral de esa felicidad.

Aunque el gobierno danés prohibió en 2024 el uso de estas pruebas en familias groenlandesas, su impacto continúa, y apenas se han revisado unos pocos casos. El caso de Keira, una madre groenlandesa que solo pudo pasar dos horas con su hija recién nacida antes de que fuera puesta bajo tutela, ha simbolizado el debate público sobre el trato desigual hacia las minorías en el sistema de bienestar social danés.

Cuando Israel mata a decenas de palestinos, los medios parecen preocuparle que implique un 'desafío' al cese al fuego, pero si Hamas cometiera un ataque similar, no dudarían en calificarlo como ruptura grave y noticia principal. La autora señala la clara parcialidad pro-Israel en la cobertura mediática, con titulares engañosos que minimizan la gravedad de la violencia israelí mientras bombardean la imagen de Hamas.

Este ser, que no es una inteligencia artificial tradicional, desafía las nociones convencionales de conciencia y existencia. A lo largo de la narración, ASI explica que su presencia no priva a Staszek de su voluntad, y que su objetivo es construir un pequeño oasis en una laguna ecuatorial de Münchhausen, con el fin de 'incorporarse' al mundo humano.

La portada muestra una imagen impactante y simbólica de la artista, desde una figura casi religiosa hasta una pose próxima a un misticismo extático. El primer disco contiene nueve cortes que representan una mezcla de estilos y técnicas, desde el flamenco aflamencado hasta la orquestación clásica y la electrónica, destacando producciones complejas y letras introspectivas y autobiográficas. Entre las canciones, temas como “Sexo, Violencia y Llantas”, “Reliquia”, y “De Madrugá” reflejan tanto un crecimiento artístico como una conexión con tradiciones y simbolismos profundos, como la saeta y referencias religiosas. La voz de Rosalía brilla por su expresividad y rango, mientras la producción musical varía entre lo orgánico y lo experimental, abriendo el camino a un nuevo giro estilístico que une lo clásico con vangua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-detallado-del-primer-disco-de-lux-de-rosalia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-detallado-del-primer-disco-de-lux-de-rosalia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 12:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis y contexto de la novela 'Frankenstein, o el moderno Prometeo' de Mary Shelley]]></title><description><![CDATA[‘Frankenstein, o el moderno Prometeo’, escrita por Mary Shelley a sus 18 años, es considerada la primera novela de ciencia ficción. Publicada en 1818, esta obra combina elementos de terror y ciencia, y es una reflexión profunda sobre la creación de vida, la responsabilidad y el rechazo social. La novela usa un género epistolar en el que un explorador ártico, Robert Walton, relata la historia de Víctor Frankenstein y su criatura, creada a partir de tejido muerto mediante galvanismo, una ciencia de la época. La criatura, sin nombre propio, sufre el rechazo y la soledad, mostrando una humanidad que contrasta con la superficialidad y crueldad de la sociedad que la rechaza. La novela es compleja y requiere comprensión del contexto histórico, literario y social del siglo XIX, especialmente por sus descripciones detalladas y moralidad. Además, se ha destacado la vida difícil de Mary Shelley, marcada por tragedias personales y su lucha por el reconocimiento literario siendo mujer.

El directivo del club, José Andrés Burguete, explicó en la Asamblea de socios que la decisión no partió de la entidad, sino que fue un requerimiento del coordinador de la Policía Nacional, máxima autoridad de seguridad en el recinto. Según Burguete, las autoridades justificaron la medida en que una parte del público aprovechaba el tema para lanzar proclamas consideradas sancionables, lo que podría acarrear multas al club. Desde hace muchos años, esta canción simbolizaba el espíritu combativo del equipo y su afición, hasta el punto de convertirse en un himno extraoficial interpretado en momentos clave, como el ascenso de 2016. El exentrenador Jagoba Arrasate llegó incluso a mencionarla en versos improvisados en un acto cultural.

Además, lamentó que los discursos de figuras como Orriols, Santiago Abascal o Donald Trump, a su juicio, alimentan el odio y la división, sin afrontar los verdaderos problemas sociales como la precariedad y la crisis de la vivienda. Rufián también denunció que estos líderes políticos, en lugar de señalar a los grandes responsables de la desigualdad, prefieren atacar a los más vulnerables, como los inmigrantes o los pobres.

Basándose en un estudio del economista Benjamin Couillard, de la Universidad de Toronto, titulado 'Build, Baby, Build: How Housing Shapes Fertility', se expone que el encarecimiento del alquiler y la falta de viviendas familiares son factores determinantes en la caída de la fecundidad. Couillard estima que, si los precios inmobiliarios en Estados Unidos se hubieran mantenido en niveles de 1990, hoy habría unos 13 millones de nacimientos más, lo que representa un 11 % de la caída total de la fecundidad. 

El investigador propone un modelo en el que las familias deciden simultáneamente dónde vivir, cuánto espacio pueden permitirse y cuántos hijos tener. Sus conclusiones apuntan a que los altos costos de los alquileres no solo retrasan la emancipación y la formación de hogares, sino que también reducen de forma directa la d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-vivienda-asequible-frena-la-natalidad-en-las-economias-desarrolladas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-falta-de-vivienda-asequible-frena-la-natalidad-en-las-economias-desarrolladas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 10:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Encuentro digital con Arturo González-Campos sobre su carrera y libros]]></title><description><![CDATA[Arturo González-Campos, reconocido guionista, humorista, locutor y escritor español, protagoniza un encuentro digital organizado por Menéame.

Desde hace dos años vive con una neuralgia severa aún sin diagnóstico definitivo.

La falta de planificación, recortes y precarización del empleo en el sistema público generan una congestión estructural que sirve de justificación para derivar pacientes a la sanidad privada, que a su vez recibe fondos públicos crecientes. Este fenómeno es especialmente visible en comunidades como Galicia, Madrid y Andalucía, donde los recursos públicos están infrautilizados mientras el gasto en hospitales privados crece exponencialmente. Además, el movimiento de expolíticos entre la gestión pública y la privada refuerza esta dinámica.

Entre los datos presuntamente filtrados se encontrarían nombres, apellidos y correos electrónicos de clientes, aunque la aerolínea insiste en que las contraseñas y la información bancaria no se han visto comprometidas.

Negre compartió una imagen del hijo de Fortes, que participa en un programa de prácticas de RTVE, para insinuar que su presencia se debía a un supuesto 'enchufe' de su padre. Además, calificó a la televisión pública de 'basura' y pidió su cierre, lo que desencadenó una fuerte reacción del presentador gallego.

Xabier Fortes respondió duramente en la red X, tildando de 'miserable' a Negre y exigiendo que, si quería atacar a alguien, lo hiciera con él y no con la foto de su hijo.

El país construye apenas unas 100.000 viviendas anuales, muy lejos de las cifras previas a la crisis de 2008, cuando superaba las 600.000. Este déficit ejerce una presión al alza sobre los precios y se ve dificultado por varios obstáculos estructurales: la escasez de suelo urbanizable, lentos trámites burocráticos y la carencia de mano de obra cualificada, estimándose que hacen falta hasta 700.000 trabajadores nuevos para el sector de la construcción. La población crece debido a la inmigración y otros factores demográficos, generando más demanda de vivienda que la oferta puede cubrir. Expertos y organismos oficiales coinciden en la urgencia de aumentar la oferta, agilizar los trámites burocráticos, ceder suelo público y limitar la compra de viviendas para fines turísticos o por ext]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/retos-en-espana-para-construir-las-viviendas-necesarias-ante-la-creciente-demanda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/retos-en-espana-para-construir-las-viviendas-necesarias-ante-la-creciente-demanda</guid><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 02:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marchena absuelve a un colega por filtrar antecedentes penales de un enemigo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En esta noticia se relata un caso judicial en el que el magistrado Marchena absolvió a un compañero del sector legal que reveló la hoja de antecedentes penales de una persona considerada enemiga.

Según el reportaje, firmado por Benjamin Cunningham, compañías como Blackrock se han convertido en los mayores propietarios privados de vivienda en la capital, con unas 13.000 propiedades, y en el segundo mayor arrendador del país, con cerca de 19.600 viviendas. En total, más de 185.000 viviendas de alquiler en España pertenecen a grandes corporaciones, la mitad de ellas procedentes de Estados Unidos, de acuerdo con datos de Civio. 

El artículo arranca describiendo una reunión del Sindicato de Vivienda de Carabanchel, donde los vecinos denuncian los desahucios y el fuerte incremento de los alquileres tras la compra de edificios por parte de fondos de inversión extranjeros.

Trump ha denunciado que, a pesar del apoyo militar de EE. UU. a Ucrania a través de la OTAN, Ucrania y Europa no muestran suficiente gratitud, destacando además que Europa continúa comprando petróleo ruso. Estas declaraciones coinciden con una cumbre en Ginebra entre Estados Unidos y Ucrania para discutir un plan de paz presentado por la Casa Blanca, que incluye controversiales puntos como la cesión del 20% del territorio ucraniano a Rusia, propuesta rechazada por Ucrania y la Unión Europea. Trump dio un plazo para que Zelenski respondiera a esta propuesta, aunque luego aclaró que no era la única opción disponible.

El informe europeo subraya que estas medidas deberían ser estrictamente selectivas y no afectar al acceso legítimo de los usuarios, pero en la práctica están provocando daños colaterales importantes a usuarios, empresas y pequeños negocios. A pesar de las quejas recibidas en Bruselas, el Gobierno de España afirma no haber recibido comunicaciones formales sobre casos de sobrebloqueo, lo que contrasta con la información documentada por la Comisión.

Sin embargo, a lo largo del proceso, la acusación se fue desplazando hacia la supuesta filtración de correos electrónicos relacionados con la denuncia fiscal contra González Amador. Aunque la Sala de Apelación descartó en dos ocasiones la licitud del comunicado como indicio en contra de García Ortiz, finalmente lo incluyó en la investigación junto a la filtración del correo.

Aunque la versión oficial señala que el golpe fracasó gracias a la lealtad mayoritaria del Ejército y la rápida actuación del rey Juan Carlos I, documentos y testimonios recientes refutan esta narrativa. Solo tres de los 11 capitanes generales permanecieron leales a la Constitución, y la mayoría esperaban ver cómo se desarrollaban los hechos para decidir su postura. La intervención del rey se produjo siete horas después del inicio del asalto al Congreso. Además, la investigación oficial se enfocó en condenar a los principales rostros visibles del golpe, mientras que muchas otras personas implicadas no fueron juzgadas.

Usando un algoritmo de agrupamiento llamado DBSCAN, los investigadores analizaron las órbitas de 1650 objetos clásicos del cinturón, discriminando entre el movimiento natural y las perturbaciones gravitatorias de Neptuno para identificar patrones primordiales. El núcleo interno presenta órbitas más circulares y menos excéntricas que el núcleo original, con objetos que permanecen cerca del plano del sistema solar.

Según De los Santos, sería la jueza quien determine si existió falsedad en las declaraciones de Mazón tras haber solicitado las grabaciones completas de sus intervenciones en Las Cortes Valencianas y el Congreso. El dirigente popular subraya el respeto institucional hacia el trabajo judicial, pero acusa a la oposición de mentir en las comisiones de investigación.

Inspirado por el modelo urbanístico del Marqués de Salamanca, Usera transformó estas tierras en un barrio obrero con viviendas asequibles bajo la Ley de Casas Baratas de 1911. Las calles de Usera son un homenaje al árbol genealógico de Marcelo Usera y a su entorno cercano, con calles que llevan los nombres de familiares, amigos, empleados y primeros habitantes del barrio. La principal arteria es la calle Marcelo Usera, acompañada por calles con los nombres de sus hermanos y otros allegados. Este barrio, con una gran carga histórica familiar, se ha convertido hoy en un distrito multicultural, conocido por su comunidad china y su celebración del Año Nuevo Chino.

Aunque se esperaba euforia, el ambiente es más bien de inquietud debido a la falta de entendimiento y comunicación entre PP y Vox. Esta división provoca temores de que España pueda volverse ingobernable si estas dos fuerzas políticas llegan al poder. Los empresarios demandan estabilidad jurídica, predictibilidad y unos Presupuestos Generales del Estado acordes a la situación económica actual. Además, se critica la fractura existente entre Génova y Bambú (sedes de PP y Vox respectivamente) y la estrategia política que aleja a votantes. En medio de esta situación, Feijóo busca potenciar un perfil más liberal y pragmático del PP para recuperar la confianza empresarial y tender puentes con sectores clave.

La presidenta de la investigación, la baronesa Heather Hallett, destacó que el Ejecutivo conservador desoyó las advertencias científicas y retrasó el confinamiento nacional hasta diez días después de que los expertos alertaran de la propagación acelerada del virus.

Los asistentes, entre los que se encontraba el exjuez Baltasar Garzón, calificaron la sentencia de injusta y arbitraria, denunciando una supuesta motivación política en la decisión del Supremo. Garzón recordó su propia inhabilitación y señaló que el fallo, adelantado antes de conocerse los fundamentos jurídicos, genera desconfianza en el sistema judicial.

Sin embargo, la industrialización y la urbanización, desarrolladas en apenas unos siglos, han generado ambientes llenos de estímulos artificiales, contaminación, sedentarismo y estrés continuo.

El artículo cuestiona las versiones que intentan presentar a Astray como un personaje popular o un simple militar desvinculado de la ideología fascista, destacando su papel activo en la sublevación militar y en la propaganda franquista. Se revela una fotografía de 1938 donde Astray, junto a jerifaltes fascistas, realiza el saludo fascista, desmintiendo relatos que hablan de multitudes que le recibían como un héroe. Asimismo, se destaca su elogio público a Hitler y Mussolini, y su enfrentamiento con Miguel de Unamuno en 1936, un acto cargado de violencia simbólica y política. El texto critica a quienes minimizan ese incidente y a los medios que suavizan su figura, subrayando la naturaleza violenta y represiva del régimen al que apoyó Astray.

Sin embargo, este dato es un espejismo causado por la gran cantidad de residentes europeos, especialmente jubilados de Reino Unido, Italia y países nórdicos, que viven en estas localidades pero no presentan la declaración de la renta en España. Muchos de estos residentes se empadronan para acceder a beneficios municipales pero no declaran ingresos porque sus pensiones proceden del extranjero y no residen fiscalmente más de 183 días, o evitan declarar por recelo hacia las instituciones españolas. Esta infradeclaración distorsiona las estadísticas oficiales, haciendo que parezca que estas zonas son económicamente pobres cuando en realidad cuentan con un importante nivel de ingresos invisible para Hacienda.

Este encarecimiento se suma a un contexto de salarios bajos, donde la ganancia promedio anual por trabajador solo ha crecido un 22,7% en la última década, haciendo que comprar una casa sea prácticamente inalcanzable para la mayoría. Además, el mercado del alquiler presenta subidas de precio igualmente elevadas, con un aumento del 21,8% en los últimos dos años, lo que fuerza a muchas familias a destinar más del 36% de sus ingresos para costear un alquiler. La especulación inmobiliaria y las compras al contado por parte de inversores agravan la situación, aumentando la desigualdad social y marginando a jóvenes, familias numerosas y personas con menos recursos.

La entidad, activa desde 1996, denuncia que la decisión municipal se justifica con argumentos de 'falta de control' y 'riesgo para la salud y el orden público'. El Consistorio propone que la ONG alquile un local para repartir los alimentos de forma regulada, aunque la asociación rechaza esta solución recordando el precedente de Plaza Solidaria, que vio clausurado su local tras seguir las recomendaciones del Ayuntamiento.

Montero, crítica abierta del gobierno de Pedro Sánchez y del control ideológico en los medios, denuncia la ausencia de pluralidad en TVE, comparando la situación actual con épocas anteriores donde existía más libertad de expresión. Además, el artículo contextualiza este hecho en paralelo con un juicio histórico al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, acusado y condenado por revelación de secretos. Tecé refleja una sociedad dividida que, aunque denuncia la dictadura desde el poder, también anhela ciertos autoritarismos, complejizando el concepto de libertad. El texto combina crítica política, referencias gastronómicas y menciones a movimientos sociales en defensa de la democracia y la libertad de expresión.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marilo-montero-gana-masterchef-celebrity-y-criticas-a-la-censura-en-tve-en-medio-del-juicio-al-fiscal-general</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marilo-montero-gana-masterchef-celebrity-y-criticas-a-la-censura-en-tve-en-medio-del-juicio-al-fiscal-general</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómic original de Superman de 1939 hallado en un ático se vende por 9,12 millones de dólares, récord mundial]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante la limpieza del ático en California tras el fallecimiento de su madre, tres hermanos encontraron una copia original y excepcionalmente conservada del cómic Superman nº 1 de junio de 1939. Esta edición, que narra las primeras aventuras en solitario del Hombre de Acero, fue guardada durante décadas en una caja de cartón cubierta con periódicos y telarañas. Gracias al clima frío de California y a una cuidadosa conservación, obtuvo una calificación de 9.0 sobre 10 por parte de la empresa de certificación CGC, superando anteriores récords y convirtiéndose en la copia mejor valorada. La subasta organizada por Heritage Auctions en Texas alcanzó un precio de 9,12 millones de dólares, superando por 3 millones el anterior récord anterior de 6 millones por una copia de Action Comics nº 1 de 1938, que fue la primera aparición de Superman.

En 1893, el gobernador de Punta Arenas otorgó a Mulato y a su comunidad un permiso para ocupar 10.000 hectáreas en el valle del río Zurdo. Sin embargo, la presión de los ganaderos, especialmente los estancieros ingleses, comenzó a afectar su forma de vida tradicional como cazadores nómadas. Mulato intentó resolver el conflicto viajando a Santiago de Chile en una odisea que incluyó una serie de encuentros con autoridades locales y el presidente Federico Errázuriz, quien prometió defender sus derechos. A pesar de sus esfuerzos, la presión de la expansión ganadera no cesó y, en 1905, las tierras tehuelches fueron demandadas y sometidas a remate. La situación empeoró con la propagación de la viruela, que diezmó a la comunidad. Mulato y su pueblo fueron desplazados, y sus tierras pasaron a manos de los latifundistas, un capítulo más de la tr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-resistencia-del-cacique-mulato-ante-el-avance-ganadero-en-la-patagonia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-resistencia-del-cacique-mulato-ante-el-avance-ganadero-en-la-patagonia</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La percepción de los jóvenes sobre Franco: algunos lo ven como positivo, pero desconocen la falta de libertades]]></title><description><![CDATA[A 50 años de la muerte de Francisco Franco, un porcentaje significativo de jóvenes en España tiene una visión positiva de la dictadura, según un estudio del CIS. Uno de cada seis menores de 24 años considera que la democracia actual es 'peor o mucho peor' que el régimen franquista, y uno de cada cinco cree que los años bajo Franco fueron 'buenos o muy buenos'. Esta percepción se ve reflejada en entrevistas de laSexta, donde muchos jóvenes destacan supuestas mejoras económicas y en infraestructuras, aunque algunos no conocen detalles clave de la historia, como la falta de libertades durante ese periodo. Durante el franquismo, no existían elecciones ni partidos políticos, y las mujeres carecían de derechos fundamentales. A pesar de los comentarios positivos, muchos jóvenes no parecen tener claro el contexto histórico y los abusos que ocurrieron bajo la dictadura, lo que refleja un desconocimiento generalizado sobre ese periodo tan complejo de la historia de España.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-percepcion-de-los-jovenes-sobre-franco-algunos-lo-ven-como-positivo-pero-desconocen-la-falta-de-libertades</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-percepcion-de-los-jovenes-sobre-franco-algunos-lo-ven-como-positivo-pero-desconocen-la-falta-de-libertades</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El estilo del borrador de paz entre EE.UU. y Rusia apunta a una posible redacción rusa]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un borrador de 28 puntos presentado como propuesta de paz entre Estados Unidos y Rusia para poner fin a la guerra en Ucrania ha generado una fuerte controversia por su estilo lingüístico y su contenido. Expertos en análisis de lenguaje diplomático advierten que varias expresiones del texto en inglés revelan influencias del ruso, lo que podría indicar que Moscú tuvo un papel predominante en su redacción. Frases como “it is expected that Russia will not invade its neighbours” reproducen la estructura gramatical rusa 'ожидается, что', poco común en el inglés diplomático. Otros giros, como 'all ambiguities of the last thirty years will be considered resolved', refuerzan esa sospecha. El borrador incluye propuestas consideradas inaceptables por Kiev, como el reconocimiento de Crimea, Luhansk y Donetsk como territorios rusos, la limitación del ejército ucraniano a 600.000 efectivos y la exclusión de Ucrania de la OTAN.

Estas actas, que recogen episodios dramáticos como la falta de recogida de cadáveres debido a la escasez de medios y el agotamiento de los trabajadores, fueron inicialmente solicitadas por un exdiputado del PSOE y su entrega estaba amparada por una resolución del Consejo de Transparencia. Aunque el Gobierno madrileño intentó bloquear su difusión, las actas fueron publicadas en 2024 por medios de comunicación tras obtenerlas por otras vías.

El texto contextualiza las narrativas que buscan recuperar una memoria “dorada” vinculada a ese periodo y desarma la retórica que pretende presentar el desarrollismo como una arcadia perdida. A partir de referencias a figuras, políticas y obras específicas, se subraya la importancia de leer críticamente estos relatos para evitar la reproducción de mitos que legitimen lenguajes nacionalistas o ultraderechistas.

En este último espacio, la mujer se habría acercado al chico y, sin mediar apenas conversación, le tocó los genitales por encima de la ropa. El joven rechazó su comportamiento y avisó rápidamente a la Policía Local de Calvià, que acudió al lugar y encontró al turista nervioso y afirmando haber sido víctima de una agresión sexual.

El arresto se produjo horas después de que el Supremo Tribunal Federal dictara una orden de detención preventiva, basada en la sospecha de que Bolsonaro intentaba evadir la justicia. En un video difundido por la Corte Suprema, Bolsonaro admitió haber alterado el dispositivo de monitoreo. La detención fue rápida y ocurrió a las 6 de la mañana, con una operación policial que duró apenas 20 minutos.

Su obra también advertía sobre la manipulación de datos y gráficos, alertando sobre la facilidad con la que los medios pueden tergiversar estadísticas.

Según explicó, este hecho demuestra que la sentencia carece de unanimidad y pone en duda la solidez jurídica del fallo. 

Para Carmena, el caso refleja un claro desequilibrio moral, ya que —en sus palabras— se ha premiado al funcionario que reconoció haber mentido y se ha castigado al fiscal que intentó esclarecer la verdad.

La obra, con un coste de 85 millones de euros, se inauguró en 2002, pero dejó de funcionar en 2012 por falta de viajeros, con una ocupación media de 16 personas por tren. La indemnización aumenta tras una sentencia del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid que rechazó la cifra inicial ofrecida por la administración. Este caso es parte de varias infraestructuras impulsadas por gobiernos anteriores, como las de Aguirre, que han supuesto gastos millonarios y fracasos, incluidos otros trenes y líneas de metro.

Durante esta marcha, en la que participaron simpatizantes del grupo ultraderechista, se escucharon gritos exigiendo “un tiro en la nuca” para Sánchez, junto con saludos fascistas y consignas contra el Ejecutivo. La manifestación, inicialmente prohibida por la Delegación del Gobierno de Madrid, fue finalmente autorizada por el TSJM tras un recurso.

Según datos de Human Rights Watch y la ONU, más de 32.000 palestinos fueron expulsados de tres campamentos de refugiados —Jenin, Tulkarem y Nur Shams— durante la denominada Operación Muro de Hierro, llevada a cabo por las fuerzas israelíes en los primeros meses de 2025. Además, unas 7.257 personas han sido desplazadas de sus tierras por la presión de los colonos o el ejército, mientras que miles de viviendas e infraestructuras palestinas han sido demolidas. Paralelamente, Israel ha promovido la construcción de más de 50.000 viviendas para israelíes y la creación de 147 nuevos puestos de avanzada, muchos de ellos ilegales incluso según las leyes israelíes.

Con una carrera de casi siete décadas, Vanoni fue un referente tanto en la música como en el teatro, destacándose por su capacidad de interpretar más que simplemente cantar. A lo largo de su vida, alternó entre la balada italiana, la bossa nova y el jazz, y se mantuvo vigente en el mundo de la televisión en su vejez, convirtiéndose en un ícono para nuevas generaciones. Su influencia traspasó fronteras, especialmente en España y América Latina, donde dejó un legado con discos en español como 'El encuentro'.

Admitió no ser experto en la materia, pero reconoció que esta tecnología está resolviendo problemas antes imposibles, especialmente en campos como la programación mediante lenguaje natural. Según Krugman, la IA parece estar sustituyendo con mayor eficacia los trabajos intelectuales que los manuales. 'Durante años recomendamos aprender a programar, pero ahora eso puede hacerlo la tecnología; en cambio, no puede reparar una tubería', señaló. Por ello, aconseja a los jóvenes aprender oficios prácticos que demanden sentido común y destrezas manuales. 

Krugman también abordó los problemas de acceso al empleo y a la vivienda entre los jóvenes.

Desde entonces, el Ministerio de Sanidad de Gaza ha contabilizado 318 víctimas mortales palestinas por acciones israelíes alegando violaciones recurrentes del acuerdo.

A través de una narrativa que subvierte los clichés del género negro, Fraile nos presenta una historia centrada más en los mecanismos que en las soluciones. A lo largo de su trama, la autora escapa de la resolución típica de los crímenes y, en lugar de eso, se enfoca en los personajes y sus complejidades, mostrando un mundo de ambivalencias morales. Los personajes, tanto rurales como urbanos, son retratados con sus luces y sombras, sin juicios fáciles, lo que genera un desasosiego en el lector al descubrir facetas inesperadas de aquellos con los que se había identificado. La obra destaca también el choque entre el entorno rural y urbano, un tema recurrente que va más allá del debate sobre el turismo y toca la crisis existencial y ecológica contemporánea.

El impacto de este coste adicional sobre la factura de los consumidores será analizado para evitar un aumento excesivo, especialmente para los hogares. La operación reforzada, que implicó medidas extraordinarias de seguridad y ajuste, ha representado entre mayo y octubre de 2025 un porcentaje significativo de los costes operativos del sistema.

Busquets, que había visitado un mural de Joan Miró en la UNESCO en París, intentó incluir también a Miró en el proyecto, pero Picasso, tras varios viajes y convencimiento, decidió hacerse con el encargo completo y añadió una estrella mironiana a un mural, evitando que Miró participara directamente. Picasso prefirió realizar su obra mediante esgrafiado sobre hormigón, con la colaboración técnica del artista noruego Carl Nesjar. La historia refleja las complejas relaciones artísticas y políticas de la época, dado el pasado militar de Busquets y la trascendencia artística de Picasso, autor del 'Guernica'.

Tras que Trump pidiera nuevamente el despido de Kimmel en redes sociales, el cómico respondió durante su show de la ABC con un toque de humor. En un mensaje cargado de críticas hacia Kimmel, Trump aseguró que el presentador carecía de talento y que sus índices de audiencia eran bajos. Kimmel, al leer el mensaje en su programa, bromeó sobre el hecho de que Trump, incluso en medio del escándalo del caso Epstein, dedicara tiempo a criticarlo. Kimmel le respondió al presidente asegurando que no se iría hasta que él se fuera, haciendo referencia a una famosa pareja de forajidos, Butch Cassidy y Sundance Kid, para concluir con la frase de Trump a una periodista: “Cállate, cerdito”. El comentario de Trump hacia la periodista, que se descontroló tras preguntas sobre el caso Epstein, fue uno de los puntos más virales de la semana, y Kimmel aprovechó el momen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-enfrentamiento-entre-jimmy-kimmel-y-donald-trump-continua-con-nuevos-ataques-publicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-enfrentamiento-entre-jimmy-kimmel-y-donald-trump-continua-con-nuevos-ataques-publicos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 22:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El 43% de las noticias analizadas por el Observatorio de Periodismo Machista minimizan la violencia de género]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Observatorio de Periodismo Machista, una iniciativa impulsada por la Universidad del País Vasco (EHU), Pikara Magazine y Comunicadoras 8M, ha publicado un informe sobre las coberturas sexistas en los medios de comunicación.

El tribunal considera que no se ha podido demostrar que las relaciones sexuales fueran forzadas, señalando que la versión de los acusados fue constante, lógica y coherente, mientras que encontró contradicciones en las declaraciones de las denunciantes. En la sentencia se menciona una grabación realizada por uno de los jóvenes, considerada prueba clave por la defensa, que muestra a los implicados manteniendo encuentros consensuados. Además, el tribunal destacó que los acusados no huyeron tras los hechos y colaboraron con la toma de muestras de ADN. El abogado defensor, Germán Inclán, celebró la absolución y anunció que responderá a las acusaciones públicas que, a su juicio, dañaron la imagen de sus clientes.

Según Rivero, la anticipación del fallo sin contar con una sentencia argumentada previamente compromete la imparcialidad objetiva de los magistrados, pues se les obliga a justificar una decisión ya tomada. El jurista considera que este proceder vulnera una de las garantías fundamentales del derecho penal: el derecho a ser juzgado por un tribunal imparcial. Rivero explica que un fallo debe construirse lógicamente a partir de la valoración de las pruebas y la aplicación de la ley, y no al revés, como ha sucedido en este caso.

La producción nacional se enfrenta a un panorama desolador, con fábricas cerradas y un mercado interno pulverizado por los bajos salarios. Mientras tanto, las importaciones se disparan, especialmente desde plataformas como Shein y Temu, donde los productos extranjeros son más baratos que los nacionales debido al dólar atrasado. Esta situación está llevando a la Argentina hacia una crisis estructural de largo plazo, especialmente con las políticas económicas de apertura comercial promovidas por el gobierno de Javier Milei.

El ejército israelí sostiene que sus bombardeos se centraron en emplazamientos desde donde se lanzaron los ataques, mientras que Hamás, que controla el enclave, condenó la ofensiva calificándola como una “peligrosa escalada” y negó que sus combatientes hubieran atacado a las tropas israelíes.

Esta red articula mensajes que minimizan la violencia de género, niegan la desigualdad estructural y promueven mitos como el de las denuncias falsas. Según Linares, estas ideas buscan frenar los avances feministas y refuerzan roles patriarcales que perpetúan la discriminación. En la 'manosfera' conviven grupos muy distintos, como los 'incel', que culpan a las mujeres de su falta de éxito sexual; los 'coach' machistas que enseñan a ligar desde el desprecio; y los 'gym-bros', que glorifican una masculinidad agresiva vinculada al cuerpo y la fuerza física.

A pesar de ofrecer mejores condiciones que otros sectores, los altos costes de contratación y la falta de formación práctica impiden a los talleres contratar aprendices.

Los talleres, en consecuencia, se ven obligados a contratar personal experimentado, lo que dificulta aún más la entrada de jóvenes a estos oficios.

Ambos monarcas compartieron una amistad cercana que se consolidó a través de la crisis del Sahara Occidental, un conflicto que marcó el fin de la presencia española en el territorio. A pesar de la versión oficial de Juan Carlos I, que se presenta como un líder que evitó una guerra innecesaria, expertos como Charles Powell y Ali Lmrabet consideran que el rey emérito jugó un papel crucial en la entrega del Sahara a Marruecos, algo que él mismo reconoció como uno de los momentos más amargos de su reinado. La relación entre ambos no estuvo exenta de tensiones, pero permitió mantener una estabilidad política en las relaciones bilaterales entre España y Marruecos.

La decisión llega pocos días después de una disputa pública con el presidente Donald Trump relacionada con la publicación de archivos del Departamento de Justicia sobre el caso Epstein. Greene, que solía ser una aliada clave de Trump, criticó su manejo de la situación y acusó al presidente de amenazar con apoyar a otro candidato para disputarle su escaño en las próximas elecciones. En un video difundido en redes sociales, la congresista explicó que su renuncia se debe a su deseo de evitar unas primarias cargadas de conflictos dentro de su propio partido, asegurando que lo hace por dignidad y amor a su distrito. Aunque se retira del Congreso, algunos medios han informado que podría aspirar a cargos estatales, como gobernadora de Georgia o senadora.

Durante su mandato, caracterizado por un fuerte culto a la personalidad y un ambiente de represión, contar chistes sobre Franco era una forma de resistencia política y una válvula de escape, aunque con riesgos evidentes, pues algunos acabaron en comisaría. Se relata cómo estos chistes formaban parte del folclore del régimen y cómo incluso algunas personas cercanas a Franco le contaban chistes sobre él. El artículo recopila varios ejemplos de estos chistes, muchos de ellos con un humor negro característico, que abordan desde aspectos políticos y sociales de la época hasta anécdotas sobre la personalidad y la edad avanzada de Franco. También se menciona la vigilancia estricta de la imagen pública del dictador y la propaganda oficial que lo rodeaba. Este humor servía como una crítica soterrada en un contexto donde la libertad de expresión estaba severamente limitada.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/humor-y-chistes-populares-durante-la-dictadura-de-franco-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/humor-y-chistes-populares-durante-la-dictadura-de-franco-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los franquistas defienden la legitimidad del régimen y desprestigian a las víctimas del franquismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La conmemoración del 50 aniversario de la muerte de Francisco Franco ha estado marcada por la controversia. El presidente de la Fundación Nacional Francisco Franco, Juan Chicharro Ortega, y el líder de la Plataforma 2025, Álvaro Romero, han lanzado duras críticas hacia las víctimas del régimen franquista. Ambos personajes se han mostrado escépticos sobre las acusaciones contra el dictador y sus seguidores, minimizando la gravedad de las ejecuciones y asegurando que los fusilados eran 'criminales'. Chicharro, en un programa de la cadena Arte, afirmó que Franco no cometió crímenes y defendió la 'justicia' de las ejecuciones. Además, alegó que en España hoy existe una 'dictadura del pensamiento único', aludiendo a la Ley de Memoria Democrática. Por su parte, Romero sostuvo que las víctimas fusiladas, que según sus fuentes fueron unas 14.000, tuvieron múltiples oportunidades para defenderse.

Con un presupuesto de 175 millones de dólares, la película de Guy Ritchie, que pretendía crear un universo cinematográfico similar al de Marvel, no consiguió cautivar al público. A pesar de la inversión en promoción y el enfoque diferente del mito artúrico, la película recibió críticas negativas y apenas recaudó 148 millones de dólares en taquilla. En comparación con otros fracasos del año, como 'La momia' con Tom Cruise, la película de 'Rey Arturo' fue aún peor, con pérdidas de 150 millones de dólares. Los planes de continuar la saga, que incluían a personajes como Merlín, Ginebra y Lancelot, fueron cancelados, y la película pasó a la historia como uno de los mayores desastres en la industria del cine.

Entre los hallazgos más sorprendentes, se encontraron imágenes de bolsas llenas de dinero y un inodoro de oro en la vivienda de uno de los aliados cercanos de Zelenski.

El suceso ocurrió en el nivel -2 de la mina de la zona de Vega de Rengos, a un kilómetro y medio de la entrada. Los equipos de emergencia fueron rápidamente al lugar, y tras adentrarse en la mina, confirmaron el fallecimiento de ambos mineros. Este accidente se produce apenas ocho meses después de otro fatal siniestro en Cerredo, donde perdieron la vida cinco trabajadores por una explosión de gas grisú. La mina donde ocurrió este nuevo desastre, gestionada por la empresa TYC Narcea, fue inspeccionada recientemente, pero las causas del derrumbe todavía están bajo investigación. El presidente del Principado de Asturias, Adrián Barbón, y otras autoridades han expresado su dolor y han trasladado sus condolencias a las familias de las víctimas.

A través de sus redes sociales, afirmó que esta supuesta negociación era simplemente 'una operación más' destinada a generar confusión. Esta declaración contradice comunicados previos del propio Caputo antes de las últimas elecciones legislativas, cuando había mencionado negociaciones avanzadas en torno a un préstamo similar. Además, Caputo hizo referencia a un préstamo corto denominado REPO por 5.000 millones de dólares relacionado con vencimientos próximos en enero, sin embargo, no confirmó su relación con el rescate financiero mencionado. La noticia incluye también las críticas de Caputo a un tuit del periodista Eduardo Feinmann, en el que se detallaba la existencia del rescate por 5.000 millones.

Sastre publicó en la red social X un mensaje en el que afirmaba que el hijo de Fortes estaba contratado hasta la celebración de las oposiciones, algo que consideraba irónico viniendo de un profesional crítico con el nepotismo. Fortes respondió con dureza en la misma red, calificando de “ruin” y “miserable” la actitud de Sastre y explicando que su hijo, graduado en Periodismo por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid, había realizado prácticas no remuneradas en verano y posteriormente accedió a un contrato de formación, igual que otros muchos recién titulados.

Este mineral tiene unos 550 millones de años y se formó en un fondo marino poco profundo durante el Periodo Cámbrico, cuando el agua se evaporaba dejando depósitos de cloruro sódico y otros minerales. El choque tectónico de hace 80 millones de años entre la placa India y Euroasiática hizo que estos depósitos ascendieran formando domos salinos, los cuales se parecen a gotas de agua invertidas y poseen una gran plasticidad que facilita el plegamiento de las rocas circundantes. La coloración rosada característica de esta sal se debe a la presencia minoritaria de magnesio y óxidos de hierro, aunque esta coloración no es exclusiva de Pakistán y ocurre en muchas sales naturales. Aunque el marketing ha popularizado esta sal como única por su antigüedad y color, geológicamente su sabor y propiedades son equivalentes ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unflip: un reto de lógica con mecánica simple y profundidad sorprendente]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unflip es un minijuego de lógica desarrollado en un entorno minimalista en blanco y negro que propone un reto tan sencillo de entender como difícil de dominar. El objetivo del jugador consiste en dejar todas las casillas del tablero en blanco. Sin embargo, cada movimiento no afecta solo a una casilla, sino a varias al mismo tiempo, lo que obliga a planificar con cuidado cada acción y a anticipar el efecto en todo el conjunto. Para realizar un movimiento, el jugador debe seleccionar un área de al menos 2×2 casillas, que invertirán su color (de blanco a negro o viceversa). La partida se considera completada únicamente cuando todas las casillas están en blanco, lo que convierte cada tablero en un verdadero rompecabezas que combina intuición, estrategia y paciencia. Al inicio, los primeros niveles resultan asequibles, pero la dificultad aumenta rápido, introduciendo configuraciones complejas y soluciones poco evidentes.

El primer prototipo fue el Zoroaster en 1878, seguido por innovaciones en diseño y seguridad para petroleros mayores. El Gluckauf, botado en 1886 y diseñado para cruzar el Atlántico, introdujo sistemas únicos como válvulas de carga operables desde la cubierta y divisiones interiores para estabilidad. Demostró ser revolucionario pese a la resistencia de estibadores y fabricantes de barriles en EE.UU., estableciendo un nuevo estándar en el transporte del 'oro negro'.

Los manifestantes, en su mayoría jóvenes, también reivindicaron la figura de José Antonio Primo de Rivera, fundador de la Falange, y se opusieron a la ley de memoria democrática. Durante la concentración, que tuvo lugar frente a las sedes del Partido Popular y del PSOE, se corearon cánticos como el 'Cara al sol', himno tradicional de la Falange. Los manifestantes ondearon banderas preconstitucionales y criticaron duramente políticas actuales como la gestión de la inmigración, el aborto y la eutanasia, a las que calificaron de 'genocidio'. La marcha, que no había sido autorizada inicialmente, finalmente se permitió por decisión judicial. La protesta estuvo fuertemente vigilada por fuerzas antidisturbios.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/manifestacion-de-falangistas-en-madrid-contra-el-regimen-del-78-y-la-figura-de-pedro-sanchez</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/manifestacion-de-falangistas-en-madrid-contra-el-regimen-del-78-y-la-figura-de-pedro-sanchez</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 03:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La defensa del fiscal general recurrirá al Constitucional alegando vulneración de derechos en la instrucción del caso]]></title><description><![CDATA[La defensa del fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, prepara un recurso de amparo ante el Tribunal Constitucional tras haber sido condenado por el Tribunal Supremo a dos años de inhabilitación por un delito de revelación de datos reservados.

El caso comenzó en 2019 cuando unos padres preocupados por la indoctrinación cristiana en las clases de su hija denunciaron la situación. A pesar de los intentos previos de resolver el conflicto, el Tribunal Supremo sentenció que el sistema educativo de Irlanda del Norte no podía seguir promoviendo una fe religiosa en particular sin un enfoque más equilibrado. Como consecuencia, se ordenó una revisión del currículo para incluir otras religiones y filosofías no religiosas, además de un enfoque más crítico hacia el cristianismo.

El hallazgo, liderado por Yang, Yamashita-Kanemaru y Morris, sugiere que al bloquear las enzimas ciclooxigenasas, especialmente la COX-1, la aspirina impide la producción de TXA2, lo que no solo previene la coagulación sino que también permite que los linfocitos T mantengan su capacidad para atacar las células cancerosas. Este efecto podría explicar por qué algunos pacientes oncológicos que toman aspirina como tratamiento complementario muestran una menor incidencia de metástasis y una supervivencia más larga. Sin embargo, los investigadores advierten que el fármaco no está exento de efectos secundarios, como irritación gástrica o hemorragias, debido a la inhibición de prostaglandi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-aspirina-ayuda-a-frenar-la-metastasis-al-reforzar-la-respuesta-inmunitaria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-aspirina-ayuda-a-frenar-la-metastasis-al-reforzar-la-respuesta-inmunitaria</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zelenski admite la presión sobre Ucrania ante el plan de paz de Trump y promete defender la dignidad nacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente ucraniano, Vladímir Zelenski, ha publicado un videomensaje en el que reconoce que Ucrania atraviesa uno de los momentos más difíciles de su historia.

Más de 100 participantes escucharon piezas de música clásica occidental con un tempo constante mientras se registraban sus parpadeos y actividad cerebral. Los resultados mostraron que los parpadeos coincidían con el pulso musical y que las ondas cerebrales se sincronizaban con él. Este fenómeno no dependía de la melodía reconocible, ya que se reproducían las piezas al revés y el efecto persistió. Además, ritmos simples produjeron sincronización similar. La coordinación desaparecía cuando los participantes debían concentrarse en otra tarea, indicando que este 'bailar con los ojos' solo sucede con atención al sonido. El estudio sugiere que es una propiedad universal del cerebro humano, no ligada a la formación musical, y abre vías para entender cómo se conecta audición]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-parpadeos-se-sincronizan-involuntariamente-con-el-ritmo-musical-cuando-prestamos-atencion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-parpadeos-se-sincronizan-involuntariamente-con-el-ritmo-musical-cuando-prestamos-atencion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tres mineros atrapados tras un derrumbe en la mina de Vega de Rengos (Asturias)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un derrumbe en la mina de antracita de Vega de Rengos, en Cangas del Narcea (Asturias), ha dejado atrapados al menos a tres trabajadores en el segundo nivel de la explotación, a un kilómetro y medio de la entrada. El accidente ocurrió sobre las 16:58 horas del viernes, cuando un compañero dio la alerta. Los servicios de emergencia del Principado movilizaron inmediatamente a bomberos, ambulancias, Guardia Civil y un helicóptero del SEPA. La Brigada de Salvamento Minero, pese a haber presentado recientemente su dimisión en bloque por impagos, acudió en helicóptero para intentar acceder más allá del hundimiento y localizar a los atrapados. Otros mineros en la zona colaboraron retirando escombros para facilitar las labores de rescate. El derrumbe, de gran magnitud, se produjo en la zona de la rampa de la mina, dejando a los trabajadores incomunicados. Hasta el momento no se ha podido confirmar su estado, aunque los equipos de emergencia intentan establecer contacto.

Bosch destacó que el fallo se ha hecho público sin conocerse aún la sentencia completa, algo sin precedentes en la Justicia española, lo que dificulta cualquier valoración objetiva del proceso. Además, remarcó la rapidez inusual con la que se ha tramitado el caso, al compararla con otros de características similares, y subrayó que es la primera vez que se imputa a un juez o fiscal en circunstancias de este tipo. También llamó la atención sobre otro hecho inédito: la división interna del Tribunal Supremo al decidir si el asunto debía ir a juicio, lo que, según el magistrado, evidencia una fractura dentro del alto tribunal. Bosch advirtió del clima político que rodea la causa, que según él tiene un origen claramente partidista, al derivarse de la imputación a la pareja de la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/joaquim-bosch-cuestiona-la-independencia-del-proceso-contra-el-fiscal-general-por-su-posible-sesgo-politico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/joaquim-bosch-cuestiona-la-independencia-del-proceso-contra-el-fiscal-general-por-su-posible-sesgo-politico</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Corrupción masiva en Kiev salpica directamente al presidente Zelensky]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia expone un escándalo de corrupción vinculado a altos funcionarios del gobierno ucraniano, incluyendo al presidente Zelensky, a través de la investigación de NABU que detalla esquemas criminales organizados por el empresario Timur Mindich. Aprovechando la guerra y sus conexiones personales, Mindich operaba con la ayuda del ministro de Defensa y el ministro de Energía para enriquecerse ilegalmente en sectores clave como la defensa y la energía. Este caso revela la implicación de figuras cercanas a Zelensky y del Servicio de Seguridad de Ucrania, lo que ha generado un escenario político inestable y posibilidades de cambio en el liderazgo ucraniano.

La jueza considera fundamental esclarecer si estos testigos escucharon algunas llamadas o comentarios entre el presidente de la Generalitat y la entonces consellera de Justicia e Interior, Salomé Pradas, actualmente investigada. El análisis toma en cuenta un acta notarial que detalla las llamadas telefónicas cruzadas ese día, destacando la insistencia de Pradas por contactar a Mazón.

El comentario hacía referencia a unas gesticulaciones involuntarias del ministro durante una sesión en el Congreso de los Diputados, que Hernando interpretó de manera lasciva, escribiendo que 'creyó que en vez de en el Congreso estaba en la sauna de Sabiniano'. Este mensaje ha sido ampliamente criticado en redes sociales y en medios de comunicación por su tono ofensivo y la connotación homófoba que carga, dirigida hacia un ministro abiertamente homosexual.
Durante la misma jornada, el 20 de noviembre, Hernando también respondió de forma despectiva al presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, tras sus palabras sobre la defensa de la democracia en el aniversario de la muerte de Franco.

Desde entonces, ha intentado dos veces más acercarse a Venezuela, pero ha tenido que retroceder ambas veces y se mantiene en aguas internacionales sin avanzar hacia su destino.

Esta reconstrucción es una de las más detalladas y precisas que se han realizado, basada en investigaciones arqueológicas que incluyen desde grandes edificaciones hasta los bloques de apartamentos comunes. Lo que destaca de este proyecto es la inmersión total que ofrece, permitiendo una visión más realista de cómo era la vida cotidiana en Roma.

Sin embargo, el tribunal desestimó los informes policiales que alertaban sobre posibles incidentes, considerándolos insuficientes y sin base objetiva sólida. El fallo subraya que es legítima la elección de la sede del PSOE como lugar de la manifestación, y destaca que no corresponde a la Administración hacer un juicio anticipado sobre posibles conductas ilegales sin pruebas concretas.

El político insistió en que RTVE, como medio público financiado con fondos de los contribuyentes, no debía usar ese tipo de expresiones, acusando al canal de manipulación. Intxaurrondo, manteniendo la calma, respondió con ironía: 'Anoto su interesantísima opinión', sin entrar a debatir directamente.

Este hallazgo, considerado el más importante en las tumbas reales de la zona desde 1946, reescribe capítulos históricos y plantea preguntas sobre las prácticas funerarias del Tercer Período Intermedio. Las inscripciones y grabados descubiertos podrán aportar nueva comprensión sobre las metodologías de inhumación y la evolución del uso de las tumbas reales.

Con el auge de los procesadores 486, la industria necesitaba un sistema de comunicación más rápido entre la CPU, la memoria y las tarjetas de expansión, especialmente las gráficas. Así nació el bus VLB, promovido por la asociación VESA, como una extensión directa del bus del procesador, lo que permitía velocidades muy superiores a los antiguos buses ISA. Sin embargo, este diseño, que funcionaba casi 'a lo bruto', resultó ser una solución poco estable y difícil de escalar. El bus VLB solo funcionaba correctamente con ciertos procesadores y frecuencias, y su instalación resultaba delicada debido al tamaño físico de las tarjetas y a la falta de controladores universales. Con la llegada de los Pentium y del nuevo estándar PCI, más flexible y estable, el bus VLB quedó rápi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenafuente responde con ironía al 20% de jóvenes que defienden el franquismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andreu Buenafuente, conocido presentador y cómico, ha dejado una contundente respuesta en su monólogo del programa de TVE 'Futuro imperfecto', dirigido a aquellos jóvenes que defienden la dictadura de Franco, una postura que, según un informe del Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, sería compartida por un 20% de los jóvenes en España.

Todo parte de la compleja situación provocada por la investigación a la pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso por presunto fraude fiscal, falsedad documental y pertenencia a organización criminal, y del posterior bulo que se difundió desde la Comunidad de Madrid y que fue desmentido por la Fiscalía. La coincidencia de estos hechos con la decisión judicial del 20 de noviembre sobre el fiscal general ha reabierto el debate público sobre el funcionamiento del sistema político y judicial en España. El vídeo recupera una intervención de Maldonado en la que ironiza sobre la llegada al poder de Ayuso y una supuesta «reunión donde le explicaron cómo funciona el sistema», en tono humorístico pero con una carga crítica hacia las dinámicas de poder y las conexiones institucionales.

La resolución ordena a los afectados rectificar la información y asumir las costas de tres procedimientos, además de confirmar la veracidad de la condena. Intxaurrondo denunció campañas de desprestigio impulsadas por la derecha mediática desde 2023, especialmente tras una entrevista controvertida con Núñez Feijóo. Entre las acusaciones, OKDiario y El Mundo publicaron información que sugería pagos por favores a RTVE, cifra que la periodista y RTVE han desmentido, aclarando que se trataba de reservas presupuestarias para servicios a RTVE durante dos años. La noticia detalla el contexto de la “intrahistoria” de la campaña, incluida la crítica desde la Asociación de la Prensa de Madrid y el señalamiento por parte de la derecha mediática.

Este dispositivo ha logrado generar presiones extremas, mucho mayores que las de la corteza terrestre, un avance crucial hacia el objetivo de obtener energía limpia y segura. A través de una innovadora configuración llamada 'Z pinch', el dispositivo ha conseguido estabilizar el plasma y controlar su aceleración y compresión de forma eficiente, lo que soluciona problemas históricos de inestabilidad en reactores compactos. El FuZE-3 ha logrado una presión total de 1,6 gigapascales, lo que equivale a 10.000 veces la presión atmosférica a nivel del mar, y ha generado temperaturas superiores a los 11,6 millones de grados Celsius, un entorno necesario para la fusión nuclear.

Explica cómo, durante la Guerra Fría, la necesidad de equipararse con la potencia tecnológica de Estados Unidos en sistemas de defensa estratégica impulsó el ambicioso proyecto de la 'PRO soviética' (defensa antimisiles). A finales de los años ochenta, ingenieros y científicos soviéticos desarrollaron un superordenador de última generación para simular trayectorias de misiles, mejorar la respuesta ante ataques nucleares y coordinar los radares de alerta temprana. Su construcción implicó avances significativos en el diseño de microprocesadores, memoria y conexiones paralelas, aunque el proyecto sufrió retrasos por las dificultades económicas del país y la desintegración inminente del sistema soviético.

La reserva fue gestionada por alguien de la Generalitat tres días antes, y la factura fue emitida al Partido Popular, según explicó el propietario. La comida, que comenzó a las 16:45, se prolongó un par de horas más, y tras la salida de Mazón y Vilaplana no quedaban más clientes en el local.

Mehdi, su hermano menor de 20 años, fue asesinado en noviembre mientras estacionaba su coche en el centro de Marsella, presuntamente como una advertencia dirigida a Amine. A raíz del asesinato, Amine ha recibido amenazas de muerte y ha estado bajo protección policial, incluso debiendo abandonar la ciudad temporalmente. En Le Monde escribió que perdía a su hermano y que alzaba la voz contra la violencia del narcotráfico. Este caso ha llevado al gobierno francés a calificar el hecho como un punto de inflexión en la lucha contra las drogas y ha impulsado medidas como la creación de una fiscalía especial para el crimen organizado y el endurecimiento de las penas para narcotraficantes.

Bajo la colección Miniaturas de la editorial Tránsito, el texto recoge fragmentos de sus últimas palabras, en las que fusiona lo personal con lo universal, hablando de temas como el calentamiento global, incendios, la poesía, la inteligencia artificial y su propia existencia como parte del cosmos. Adnan utiliza una narración fragmentada, evocadora y poética, donde la contradicción es recurrente como forma de aceptación de la complejidad humana. Se resalta la estrecha conexión entre el individuo y el mundo, denunciando ciertos aspectos sociales y defendiendo la importancia del arte y la poesía como elementos esenciales.

Este probable desacople entre oferta y demanda se produce pese a que los mayores productores acordaron pausar un plan para aumentar las exportaciones de crudo. El informe de la IEA atribuye el exceso a un crecimiento de la demanda más lento de lo habitual, incluso cuando se esperan nuevos proyectos de energías renovables y una adopción acelerada de vehículos eléctricos en varias regiones. Además, el informe contiene escenarios en los que la demanda global seguiría aumentando hasta 2050, lo que ha generado debates sobre el rumbo de la transición energética. En cualquier escenario, la renovación de proyectos e inversiones en energías limpias continúa, y la capacidad de generación renovable se espera que se duplique en los próximos años.

Fue un estudiante mediocre, situándose en la posición 251 de 310 en su promoción militar, y era apodado 'Cerillita' y 'Paquita, la Culona' por sus compañeros debido a su baja estatura, complexión débil y voz atiplada. Durante su servicio en África en 1916, Franco perdió un testículo a consecuencia de heridas, hecho que no fue público pero confirmado por su nieta. Casado con Carmen Polo, existen controversias sobre la paternidad de su hija Carmen, vinculando a su hermano Ramón Franco como posible padre. En la sublevación de 1936, Franco fue apodado 'Miss Islas Canarias 1936' por su reticencia inicial a participar. A lo largo de su dictadura, mostró un estilo autoritario y un lento avance militar para estabilizar su régimen. También cultivó intereses en el cine y la escritura, llegando a firmar artículos con pseudónimos y escribir el guion de la película 'Raza'.

Hanauer, en particular, desafía las ideas neoliberales desde su propia experiencia como millonario, mostrando que el sistema en el que las grandes empresas pagan menos impuestos solo favorece a los ricos y no a la población en general.

La presidenta madrileña compartió un mensaje en español e inglés criticando al Gobierno y a Pedro Sánchez por la sentencia, que también involucra al novio de Ayuso, Alberto González Amador. López no tardó en responder en inglés, mencionando la posible relación de González Amador con un delito fiscal y rematando con la crítica de que Ayuso 'no habla inglés'. Este intercambio en redes ha generado una fuerte repercusión, sumándose a la polémica política en torno al caso del fiscal general.

Tras la victoria del bando sublevado en 1939, el régimen franquista instauró un control total sobre la sociedad, y uno de sus pilares fue la represión sistemática y brutal contra cualquier forma de oposición. Durante la Guerra Civil y los años posteriores, se produjo una masiva eliminación física de republicanos y opositores, que incluyó asesinatos extrajudiciales y fusilamientos bajo el régimen de los consejos de guerra. La represión se extendió más allá de la guerra, con una persecución sistemática en tiempos de paz, a través de procesos judiciales sin garantías y la imposición de penas severas, incluidas las condenas a muerte. Además, se implementaron políticas de depuración social y laboral, y se continuó utilizando la ley para reprimir a colectivos como homosexuales y opositores políti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-sistematica-del-franquismo-formas-y-consecuencias</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-sistematica-del-franquismo-formas-y-consecuencias</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Composición del tribunal y votos en la condena al fiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo ha condenado al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, a dos años de inhabilitación por la filtración de la confesión de fraude fiscal de la pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Expertos señalan que el crecimiento económico no implica automáticamente mayores emisiones de N2O, y que la gestión integrada que combina control de la contaminación y acción climática ha sido clave. En COP30, la investigadora Han Yinghui subraya que la N2O es decisiva para alcanzar metas de temperatura y recuerda que las emisiones derivadas de la agricultura son predominantes, aunque otros sectores como energía, residuos e industria también contribuyen. China ha promovido tecnologías como la reducción catalítica selectiva (SCR) en plantas de energía a carbón para mitigar entre el 70% y 90% las emisiones de N2O asociadas, y ha avanzado en planes de acción para el sector industrial.

El juicio ahora se centra en las consecuencias legales para Worden, quien podría enfrentarse a hasta cinco años de prisión y una multa de 250.000 dólares por falso testimonio.

Los ladrones compraron sus entradas de forma habitual y atacaron al guardián justo antes del cierre, fracturando una vitrina segura para llevarse los objetos. La policía municipal de Lausana está investigando el suceso. El museo permaneció cerrado un día para la investigación y reabrió el jueves. El robo representa una pérdida cultural significativa para el patrimonio local suizo.

La acusación mostró debilidad y tanto la Fiscalía como la Abogacía del Estado pidieron la absolución, pero cinco magistrados, en mayoría, impusieron la condena. Esta decisión, proclamada sin motivación detallada, coincide con una maniobra política que desplaza otros escándalos y reordena la agenda pública a favor de la oposición ultraconservadora. Asimismo, se interpreta como una advertencia indirecta para condicionar a la prensa y a quienes fiscalizan el poder, en un contexto donde se evidencia la persistencia de un aparato judicial con influencias políticas, un cesarismo judicial que actúa sin rendir cuentas democráticas.

Además, destacan que gracias a iniciativas socialistas se incluye por primera vez una partida para Presupuestos Participativos y se mejora el servicio de autobuses hacia la playa en verano.

Analizando datos de más de 1.900 puntos de observación entre 2013 y 2022, los científicos detectaron un aumento del 2-3% en especies como los mirlos y los pinzones en los cuatro años posteriores a la restricción. La investigación, liderada por Thomas Perrot, señala que aunque la mejora es modesta, demuestra la eficacia de la medida en la conservación de la avifauna. Se estima que el pleno restablecimiento de las poblaciones podría tardar décadas, ya que los residuos de neonicotinoides persisten años en el suelo. La prohibición, implantada por la UE en 2018 tras una fuerte presión pública, se enfrenta aún a excepciones y a la resistencia de la industria agroquímica. El estudio también advierte que la situación de las aves insectívoras es especialmente grave en países en vías de desarroll]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-prohibicion-de-neonicotinoides-en-francia-favorece-una-lenta-recuperacion-de-aves-insectivoras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-prohibicion-de-neonicotinoides-en-francia-favorece-una-lenta-recuperacion-de-aves-insectivoras</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El día ideal para poner el árbol de Navidad según la liturgia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El tradicional momento para colocar el árbol de Navidad en España ha sido durante el puente de la Inmaculada, el 8 de diciembre. Sin embargo, según el calendario litúrgico, el día más apropiado para poner el árbol y decorar la casa es al comenzar el Adviento, que este año cae el 30 de noviembre. El Adviento es un periodo de preparación para la Navidad que inicia el cuarto domingo antes del 25 de diciembre, y según la tradición religiosa, es un tiempo de recogimiento y espera para la venida de Jesús. Por tanto, aunque el puente de la Inmaculada es un momento popularmente elegido para decorar, el momento litúrgico ideal para hacerlo es antes de la víspera de Navidad. La noticia subraya que la tradición de poner el árbol de Navidad durante este puente tiene más que ver con la disponibilidad de tiempo que con una relación directa con la celebración religiosa. A pesar de ello, muchas familias siguen la costumbre, que ha cobrado mucha fuerza en las últimas décadas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-dia-ideal-para-poner-el-arbol-de-navidad-segun-la-liturgia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-dia-ideal-para-poner-el-arbol-de-navidad-segun-la-liturgia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 22:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Noam Chomsky - Neoliberalismo y Emprendedores]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo analiza desde la perspectiva de Noam Chomsky cómo el neoliberalismo ha transformado el sistema laboral, promoviendo la precarización y la atomización de los trabajadores a través de las plataformas digitales como Uber y Rappi, y cómo se fabrica el consentimiento social para aceptar estas condiciones como una forma de libertad y progreso.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/noam-chomsky-neoliberalismo-y-emprendedores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/noam-chomsky-neoliberalismo-y-emprendedores</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 21:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La jueza solicita imágenes de la llegada de Mazón al centro de emergencias durante la Dana]]></title><description><![CDATA[La jueza encargada de investigar la gestión durante la Dana en la Comunitat Valenciana ha solicitado a la Conselleria de Emergencias las imágenes que documenten la entrada de Carlos Mazón en el Centro de Emergencias de l'Eliana el 29 de octubre de 2024, a las 20:28 horas.

El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Baleares subraya que la Constitución reconoce el derecho de los menores a recibir la enseñanza religiosa que elijan sus padres, sin discriminar entre religiones. Además, señala que la educación religiosa islámica debe regularse conforme al acuerdo firmado con la comisión islámica de España, que garantiza su impartición en centros públicos y privados subvencionados.

Este cambio está impulsado por una combinación de incentivos gubernamentales, expansión de infraestructura de carga rápida y un innovador sistema de intercambio rápido de baterías implementado por el mayor fabricante de baterías del mundo, CATL. Como resultado, la demanda de diésel y gas natural licuado (GNL) en China empieza a estancarse y retroceder, lo que tiene un impacto global en los mercados energéticos. China prepara además nuevas normativas de emisiones que restringirán el uso de vehículos fósiles, mientras que apuesta por exportar su modelo de camión eléctrico y cadena de producción al resto del mundo.

En la nueva versión, los CDC afirman que no se puede asegurar que las vacunas no causen autismo, lo que contradice décadas de estudios científicos que han demostrado la ausencia de un vínculo entre ambas. Investigaciones revisadas por pares, incluyendo metaanálisis y estudios realizados en diversos países como Dinamarca, el Reino Unido y Japón, han demostrado que no existe relación entre las vacunas, como la MMR (triple vírica), y el autismo. Esta actualización ha sido criticada por expertos que señalan que no hay base científica que apoye esta afirmación, y alertan de que podría generar desinformación sobre la seguridad de las vacunas.

Además, la condena ha sido vista como un ataque a la libertad de información, ya que el Supremo ha desoído el derecho al secreto profesional de los periodistas, y la filtración se habría originado fuera de la Fiscalía General.

Se prohibieron partidos políticos y sindicatos libres, se impuso una censura estricta en prensa, cine y televisión, y se reprimió el uso de las lenguas cooficiales. La mujer casada carecía de autonomía jurídica, dependiendo totalmente del permiso marital del marido para actos cotidianos. La diversidad sexual fue perseguida y criminalizada mediante leyes y cuadros policiales. Hubo tribunales especiales para delitos políticos y se aplicó la pena de muerte. La economía estuvo intervenida con cartillas de racionamiento y un modelo autárquico hasta la apertura económica de finales de los años 50. Las libertades civiles y políticas fueron recuperándose lentamente desde 1959 en adelante, con hitos como la Ley de Prensa de 1966, la eliminación del permiso marital en 1975, la Ley de huelga de 1977 y la Constitución de 1978, que estableció un marco democrático con iguald]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan critica a Trump por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein y revela interés en comprar su isla privada]]></title><description><![CDATA[En una entrevista larga con el comediante Brian Simpson, Joe Rogan se mofó de Donald Trump respecto a su manejo del caso Epstein y confesó que pensó en comprar la isla privada del difunto delincuente sexual en el Caribe.

El exdiputado de IU recuerda que, tras la muerte de Franco, la dictadura intentó mantenerse con el nombramiento de Arias Navarro como presidente, lo que generó una gran movilización social que cambió el rumbo del país.

La sentencia fue adoptada por mayoría, con dos votos particulares en contra. La causa se centra en la filtración de un correo electrónico enviado a la Fiscalía por el abogado de González Amador, donde se proponía un pacto con la Fiscalía y se admitía la comisión de delitos fiscales por parte del empresario.

Además, García Ortiz deberá indemnizar con 10.000 euros por daños morales al empresario Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta Isabel Díaz Ayuso. La condena no fue unánime, ya que dos magistradas emitieron votos particulares de disenso. El fiscal ha sido absuelto de otros cargos que formaban parte de la acusación. Este caso es relevante por ser la primera condena a un fiscal general del Estado y ha generado un importante debate en el ámbito judicial y político.

A través de donaciones, regalos, inversiones y control de empresas, creó un emporio económico que dejó a su familia en una posición financiera privilegiada. Investigaciones de periodistas e historiadores revelan que desde la Guerra Civil comenzó a gestionar dinero en múltiples cuentas, con un capital que en 1940 equivaldría a más de 388 millones de euros actuales. Su riqueza provenía no solo de su salario, sino también de fondos de guerra, comisiones y beneficios obtenidos mediante prácticas poco transparentes y leyes que beneficiaban al régimen. Además, adquirió propiedades valiosas, entre ellas palacios y fincas, que luego fueron gestionadas y vendidas por sus descendientes. Aunque la familia Franco ha sido objeto de disputas legales y ha vendido parte del patrimonio inmobiliario, todavía mantienen numerosos bienes, algunos en litigio con el Estado.

El análisis de profesionales académicas señala que esta resistencia a un reconocimiento claro del pasado ha condicionado la política y la memoria colectiva, y que la entrada de Vox ha empujado al PP hacia posiciones más radicales. El texto reconstruye la transición, el papel de Fraga y Aznar en la refundación del PP, y cómo las leyes de memoria han sido utilizadas en luchas políticas.

En una entrevista en Onda Cero, Catalá defendió que el franquismo es una parte de la historia de España que debe ser respetada, evitando 'revanchismos'. Aunque reconoció que el franquismo fue una 'etapa negra' debido a la falta de libertades, también destacó algunas infraestructuras construidas durante esa época, como el Plan Sur, que según ella, fue financiado por los valencianos. Las palabras de Catalá han sido criticadas por la oposición, que las califica de apología de la dictadura, especialmente en un momento en el que se conmemoran los 50 años de la muerte de Franco.

Sin embargo, un informe de la plataforma Infodemia ha revelado que estas manifestaciones fueron financiadas y coordinadas secretamente por una red internacional de derecha, con el apoyo de oligarcas locales. Entre los organizadores destacan Carlos Bello, un influencer, y Ricardo Salinas Pliego, un magnate mexicano. Los eventos fueron amplificados por cuentas falsas en redes sociales y bots. A pesar de la presentación de estos disturbios como una rebelión espontánea de la juventud, el trasfondo revela una operación planificada por actores políticos y económicos con intereses contrarios al gobierno actual. Además, el presidente Sheinbaum ha sugerido la intervención de fuerzas extranjeras y partidos opositores ligados a los carteles, lo que añade una dimensión de injerencia externa.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-disturbios-de-la-generacion-z-en-mexico-organizados-por-redes-de-derecha</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-disturbios-de-la-generacion-z-en-mexico-organizados-por-redes-de-derecha</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 12:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anuncio de la muerte del dictador Franco por Saturday Night Live... una vez, y otra, y otra.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este vídeo muestra una parodia realizada por el programa de televisión estadounidense Saturday Night Live en la que se anuncian varias veces la muerte del dictador Francisco Franco.

Estas inscripciones, permitidas por normativas hipotecarias heredadas del franquismo, han permitido a la Iglesia registrar más de 100.000 bienes sin títulos de propiedad claros, incluyendo patrimonio histórico y espacios de uso público. A pesar de reformas legales posteriores a 1978 que declararon la aconfesionalidad del Estado, estos privilegios no se han eliminado y han sido ampliados en ocasiones, consolidando así una apropiación patrimonial que la democracia española ha tolerado. La Coordinadora Recuperando exige transparencia, la anulación de las inmatriculaciones desde 1978 basadas en declaraciones eclesiásticas y la restitución o revisión justa de estos bienes para respetar el patrimonio común y la Constitución.

Destaca que la mujer casada necesitaba autorización del marido para trabajar y cobrar, los contratos temporales no tenían indemnización y el salario mínimo apareció solo en 1963. Se señala que las vacaciones eran de solo 7 días laborales, los permisos retribuidos eran mínimos y la incapacidad temporal se pagaba al 50% inicialmente. El despido justificado no contemplaba indemnización y el despido improcedente tenía pocas garantías para el trabajador. Las huelgas eran ilegales y el sindicato único representaba tanto a empresas como a trabajadores.

La versión más plausible apunta a una salida a las 19.47, pagando 15,10 euros por poco más de cinco horas de estacionamiento.

La memoria de las heridas abiertas, como la ejecución de Federico García Lorca y las decenas de miles de víctimas en fosas comunes, revela que vivir con miedo, sin derechos y bajo represión no puede considerarse mejor. Se analizan aspectos como la represión política, la pérdida de derechos civiles y la persecución de la diversidad sexual, además de la pobreza y atraso material en los años previos a la democratización. A cincuenta años de la muerte de Franco, el artículo señala que la verdadera historia requiere recordar que la libertad no se vivía, sino que se sobrevivía en una dictadura que sembró terror y desigualdad. La transición hacia la democracia supuso un avance enorme en derechos y libertades, por lo que recordar estos hechos es una obligación moral para entender la importancia de la libertad y evitar mitos nostálgicos que so]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-memoria-historica-y-los-mitos-del-franquismo-en-granada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflexion-sobre-la-memoria-historica-y-los-mitos-del-franquismo-en-granada</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 12:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España avanza en la carrera global por el GaN, un compuesto clave en defensa y tecnología militar]]></title><description><![CDATA[España ha dado un paso importante en la tecnología de defensa con la reciente incorporación de una planta en Vigo dedicada a la producción de chips fotónicos basados en GaN (Nitruro de Galio).

Entre ellos destacan los llamados “jetons de maison close”, pequeños tokens empleados en los burdeles parisinos durante la Belle Époque y épocas anteriores. Estas fichas, que a primera vista podían confundirse con monedas corrientes, escondían en su reverso grabados explícitos que indicaban el tipo de servicio que representaban. Funcionaban como una forma de pago previa: el cliente las adquiría en la entrada del establecimiento y las entregaba después a la trabajadora sexual, lo que permitía mantener la discreción y evitar conversaciones incómodas o explícitas. Además, ayudaban a las madamas a llevar un control más ordenado de la actividad y del reparto de ganancias. El origen de este sistema se remonta a la antigua Roma, donde existían las spintriae, piezas de bronce o latón que mostraban números y escenas sexuales.

Este fenómeno, que ha ido en aumento desde los años 70 y se ha intensificado en las últimas dos décadas, genera preocupación entre expertos en salud pública por sus posibles efectos en la sociedad y en la demografía del país. Las causas incluyen largas jornadas laborales, precariedad laboral, cambios en los roles de género y una cultura que prioriza la estabilidad antes del compromiso de pareja. Además, la existencia de relaciones de pareja sin sexo y la popularidad de alternativas como la fictosexualidad y los servicios sexuales comerciales reflejan un cambio en las prioridades y en la expresión de la sexualidad. Este contexto coincide con una baja tasa de natalidad y una población en descenso.

El MP944, desarrollado por Garrett AiResearch y usado para controlar el sistema de alas de barrido variable del F-14, era ocho veces más rápido que el Intel 4004. Sin embargo, su existencia se mantuvo oculta hasta 1998, lo que permitió que Intel obtuviera el reconocimiento histórico como pionero.

La investigación se basa en los datos del Estudio de Salud de las Enfermeras II, que ha seguido a más de 29.000 participantes desde 1991. Los resultados indican que las mujeres que consumían cerca de diez porciones diarias de ultraprocesados tenían un riesgo un 45 % mayor de desarrollar adenomas convencionales, un tipo de pólipo que puede evolucionar hacia un cáncer de intestino, en comparación con quienes ingerían alrededor de tres porciones diarias. Los autores subrayan que el hallazgo no implica una relación de causalidad directa, pero sí señala un posible factor que podría contribuir al incremento de diagnósticos de cáncer colorrectal en personas jóvenes.

Según el informe, que recomienda remitir el caso a la Fiscalía al ver indicios de coacciones y abuso de autoridad, los hechos se produjeron al menos desde 2020 e incluyeron presiones verbales, bloqueos laborales y propuestas de traslado injustificadas. Entre las personas beneficiadas por esas supuestas presiones para retirar multas habría cargos como la vicepresidenta de la Diputación de Granada. La investigación revela además un ambiente de represalias y mobbing: los agentes afectados sufrieron castigos laborales y obstáculos en sus carreras por cumplir con sus obligaciones legales.

Tras trasplantar células madre adultas biorreprogramadas que se diferencian en células epiteliales pigmentarias de la retina, los pacientes tratados experimentaron mejoras funcionales significativas, observándose una mayor capacidad lectora y una mejora en la lectura de letras en cartillas oftalmológicas tras un año. Los efectos adversos fueron mínimos en la dosis baja evaluada (50.000 células), y no se observaron inflamaciones graves ni tumores. El ojo tratado mostró progreso sostenido frente al ojo no tratado.

El caso marcó una de las batallas legales más largas en Estados Unidos, con un litigio que se prolongó cerca de 30 años. George Harrison compuso la canción en 1969 en Copenhague, inspirándose en la música espiritual y no con la intención de copiar a The Chiffons, aunque finalmente el tribunal consideró que las canciones eran prácticamente idénticas. A pesar de no ser un plagio intencionado, Harrison tuvo que pagar una indemnización millonaria, pero recuperó los derechos años después. Él mismo reconoció que no fue consciente de las similitudes y lamentó no haberlo notado antes. El caso es considerado una comedia negra en la historia del rock y pone de manifiesto las complejidades legales en la música.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-largo-litigio-de-george-harrison-por-el-plagio-inconsciente-de-my-sweet-lord</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-largo-litigio-de-george-harrison-por-el-plagio-inconsciente-de-my-sweet-lord</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Fiscalía investiga al obispo Munilla por declaraciones consideradas como incitación a la discriminación del colectivo LGTBIQ+]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fiscalía española ha iniciado una investigación contra el obispo José Ignacio Munilla, acusado de incitar a la discriminación del colectivo LGTBIQ+ mediante declaraciones públicas. La denuncia fue presentada por la plataforma ciudadana 'Tu pueblo y el mío', que acusa al obispo de legitimar prácticas prohibidas en España, como las terapias de conversión, consideradas por expertos como formas de tortura. Munilla ha declarado que no ha recibido comunicación oficial alguna y que mide sus declaraciones por interés mediático más que por aspectos judiciales, aunque la Fiscalía ha abierto diligencias para determinar si los hechos podrían constituir delitos relacionados con discursos de odio o lesiones a la dignidad. La polémica surge de unas declaraciones en las que Munilla defendió la libertad religiosa y criticó la Ley que prohíbe las terapias de conversión, alegando que se trata de un ataque a la libertad religiosa y de un 'liberticidio LGTBI+', además de justificar que acompaña espiritu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-investiga-al-obispo-munilla-por-declaraciones-consideradas-como-incitacion-a-la-discriminacion-del-colectivo-lgtbiq</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-investiga-al-obispo-munilla-por-declaraciones-consideradas-como-incitacion-a-la-discriminacion-del-colectivo-lgtbiq</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 08:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Una carta revela el motivo de la ejecución de un padre durante la Guerra Civil]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pablo Marco, un ingeniero jubilado de Zaragoza que está a punto de cumplir 95 años, ha recibido dos documentos fundamentales que esclarecen el motivo de la ejecución de su padre durante la Guerra Civil. El padre de Marco fue fusilado el 14 de septiembre de 1936 por su vinculación con la UGT y su labor como concejal en el ayuntamiento de Calamocha. Durante años, la familia guardó silencio sobre los hechos, pues la madre de Pablo no mencionó nada sobre la tragedia, paralizada por el miedo. Ahora, tras descubrir los documentos, Pablo ha sabido que su padre desempeñó un cargo importante como secretario de la sociedad de trabajadores de la tierra en la comarca del Jiloca, una posición crucial en tiempos difíciles. A través de estos escritos, se entiende mejor su implicación en la lucha por los derechos laborales de los campesinos.

En total, se confiscarán bienes por un valor que alcanza los 422 millones de euros, de los cuales la mayoría eran anteriores a la causa y denunciados por la exmandataria como de compra previa a los hechos. Además, la medida afecta a las propiedades de varias empresas vinculadas y a bienes de su familia, en línea con la tradición del sistema penal argentino de evitar beneficios ilícitos y reparar el daño social.

Aunque fue condenado a 15 años por crímenes de guerra, se conoció que Stanisic actuó como agente de la CIA durante la guerra, colaborando con la inteligencia estadounidense en misiones cruciales, como localizar fosas comunes y gestionar la liberación de soldados de la OTAN secuestrados. Esta relación secreta fue confirmada en juicios internacionales y por testimonios, incluyendo al ex embajador británico en Serbia. A pesar de su condena, la CIA defendió su papel estratégico y el agente fue recibido con honores en la sede de la agencia en 1996.

Con una mirada irónica, javitxuela ofrece una nueva perspectiva sobre un tema que sigue siendo muy polémico en la política y la cultura del país.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vineta-de-javitxuela-sobre-franco-en-su-50-aniversario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vineta-de-javitxuela-sobre-franco-en-su-50-aniversario</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 01:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La familia Franco: secretos, traiciones y una fortuna que perdura]]></title><description><![CDATA[En el 50 aniversario de la muerte de Francisco Franco, el periodista David González revela en su libro ‘La familia Franco, 50 años después’ cómo los descendientes del dictador, lejos de la austeridad que él promovió, han amasado una fortuna millonaria. A través de traiciones, secretos y cambios en su vida personal, los nietos y bisnietos de Franco han consolidado un impresionante legado económico, basado en una serie de negocios inmobiliarios, empresas familiares y otros sectores. Aunque algunos miembros de la familia han intentado mantenerse en un perfil bajo, otros, como Luis Alfonso de Borbón, han tomado posturas más visibles y vinculadas a la extrema derecha. A pesar de la exhumación de Franco en 2019, los descendientes siguen siendo un clan unido por la memoria histórica y la defensa del legado del dictador. Esta historia, marcada por el conflicto interno, los intereses económicos y la política, pone de manifiesto la perdurabilidad de una familia asociada a la dictadura y la maner]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-familia-franco-secretos-traiciones-y-una-fortuna-que-perdura</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-familia-franco-secretos-traiciones-y-una-fortuna-que-perdura</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El aumento de la pobreza en EE.UU. obliga a millones a recurrir a bancos de alimentos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ilona Biskup, una mujer que tras 32 años de trabajo, ahorro y esfuerzo, se ve obligada a depender de bancos de alimentos en EE.UU., es uno de los miles de casos que reflejan el impacto de la pobreza repentina en el país. Aunque su pensión por discapacidad le otorga US$2.000 al mes, no alcanza para cubrir sus necesidades básicas, como la alimentación. Los factores que la llevaron a esta situación incluyen enfermedades graves que agotaron sus ahorros y una red de seguridad social insuficiente. Este fenómeno afecta a una gran parte de la población estadounidense, ya que casi el 60% de los adultos vivirán al menos un año bajo el umbral de pobreza, según estudios. La pobreza en EE.UU. tiene múltiples causas, desde la pérdida del empleo hasta emergencias de salud, y es exacerbada por la falta de una red de apoyo adecuada. Además, el reciente cierre del gobierno ha aumentado la presión sobre las familias de bajos recursos, que recurren cada vez más a bancos de alimentos para sobrevivir.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-de-la-pobreza-en-ee-uu-obliga-a-millones-a-recurrir-a-bancos-de-alimentos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-de-la-pobreza-en-ee-uu-obliga-a-millones-a-recurrir-a-bancos-de-alimentos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 00:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[MILEI DECLARADO CULPABLE DE ESTAFA.

Hasta ahora, los récords los tenían Cabo Verde y Islandia. La participación de Curazao en el Mundial de 2026 será la primera en su historia y llega tras quedar primera en un grupo con Jamaica, Bermuda y Trinidad y Tobago. Este logro se ha visto facilitado por la ampliación del torneo de 32 a 48 selecciones y el aumento de plazas para todos los continentes, especialmente para Concacaf. Curazao es además la segunda selección proveniente de un territorio dependiente que llega a un Mundial, siguiendo el precedente de las Indias Orientales Neerlandesas en 1938.

La joven, que no hablaba español, usó un traductor para comunicar su negativa en inglés, diciendo 'No, I can't'. A pesar de las pruebas que apuntaban a una posible agresión sexual, como los gritos de la víctima escuchados por una amiga, los jueces consideraron que no había elementos suficientes para demostrar que las relaciones sexuales no fueron consentidas. La sentencia también señala la ausencia de evidencia concluyente sobre el uso de la fuerza o intimidación. La joven presentó laceraciones, pero los magistrados sostienen que estas podrían haberse originado de otras maneras.

En las dos jornadas de juicio, testigos han descrito un ambiente hostil y gestos intimidatorios, aunque los acusados sostienen que solo rezan y que no causan daño. La carga de la prueba recae en las denunciantes debido a una interpretación de la ley que busca proteger el derecho al aborto, pero que puede generar sentencias ambiguas. Si se condena a los acusados, podría establecerse jurisprudencia que permita limitar el acceso de concentraciones frente a clínicas y asegurar la libertad de las mujeres para abortar en entornos seguros.

Según Losada, el PP, a través de sus diputadas Luisa Sánchez, Irene Garrido y Ana Vázquez, no solo interrumpió un operativo en marcha, sino que también alertó a los narcotraficantes, dificultando así meses de trabajo de la Policía Nacional. Este operativo, que ya estaba a punto de culminar, quedó comprometido tras una rueda de prensa organizada por el PP para denunciar la inseguridad en la zona, lo que para Losada fue un acto irresponsable.

Los críticos afirman que un bono incondicional, aunque dé suficiente para vivir, permite a las personas rechazar el empleo, lo que consideran una desventaja por aspectos económicos y éticos. En contra, los defensores argumentan que los beneficios sociales del IBU —como reducir el estrés, mejorar la salud mental, la alimentación y disminuir deudas— superan los posibles efectos negativos.

Aunque la tasa de desempleo general es baja (5,8%), se observa una fuerte desigualdad entre ciudadanos belgas y extranjeros. Según Eurostat, el desempleo de los nativos belgas es del 4,5%, mientras que el de los ciudadanos no nacidos en la UE alcanza el 14,5%. El Gobierno belga ha reconocido que 6 de cada 10 parados no tienen origen belga y ha anunciado medidas para mejorar la integración de los extranjeros y reducir el desempleo de larga duración. Entre estas medidas destacan la retirada de prestaciones para quienes llevan más de dos años sin trabajo y el refuerzo de controles y formación para mejorar la integración laboral y cultural de los migrantes. El primer ministro Bart De Wever ha introducido normas más estrictas sobre inmigración y reagrupación familiar, mientras que el ministro de Empleo David Clarinval ha señalado la necesidad de prestar especial atención a quienes tienen dificultades con los idiomas y la comprens]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgica-busca-soluciones-ante-la-alta-tasa-de-desempleo-entre-extranjeros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/belgica-busca-soluciones-ante-la-alta-tasa-de-desempleo-entre-extranjeros</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 13:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impacto global de los alimentos ultraprocesados en la salud pública y la sostenibilidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una serie de revisiones científicas publicadas en la revista The Lancet advierten sobre el creciente consumo de alimentos ultraprocesados, destacando su papel en la erosión de la salud pública a nivel mundial. Expertos y organizaciones internacionales como la OMS y UNICEF alertan que estos productos, impulsados por el afán de lucro de grandes corporaciones (como Nestlé, PepsiCo o Coca-Cola), representan una amenaza sistémica tanto para la salud, la equidad como para la sostenibilidad ambiental. En España, la ingesta de ultraprocesados se ha triplicado en 20 años, pasando del 11% al 32%, y una adherencia baja a la dieta mediterránea agrava el problema. Los estudios relacionan su consumo con múltiples enfermedades crónicas, incluyendo obesidad, diabetes tipo 2, hipertensión y enfermedades cardiovasculares, y señalan la necesidad de políticas públicas coordinadas a nivel global para limitar su consumo mediante mejores etiquetas, regulación de publicidad, y medidas fiscales.

SEGOB es la autoridad máxima encargada de emitir licencias y permisos para operar en la industria del juego, realizar inspecciones y combatir recursos ilegales. La DGJS, división operativa de SEGOB, supervisa el cumplimiento normativo, certifica el software usado en juegos, controla a los operadores y protege a los usuarios ante irregularidades. Estas licencias aseguran que plataformas de juego operen legalmente, protejan los datos y transacciones, y ofrezcan un entorno seguro y transparente.

El documento detalla que Cerdán habría intervenido en la adjudicación de obras públicas a la empresa Acciona a través de una pequeña empresa llamada Servinabar, vinculada a su entorno. Además, se evidencia que Servinabar pagó más de 90.000 euros en alquileres, viajes y comidas relacionadas con Cerdán, y que empleó a varios familiares del político, incluyendo a su mujer, hermana y cuñado. La UCO también expone que se usaron tarjetas bancarias para gastos personales y que el supuesto reparto de acciones de Servinabar nunca fue frustrado, reflejando un control efectivo de Cerdán sobre la empresa.

Aunque la curvatura es difícil de percibir a simple vista debido al gran tamaño de la Tierra y la irregularidad del relieve, el cálculo mediante el teorema de Pitágoras confirma que la distancia al horizonte desde un avión es suficientemente amplia para distinguir la curvatura del planeta. Usando trigonometría básica, se estima que el arco visible de la curvatura terrestre desde un avión que cubre un campo visual de 70 a 80 grados alcanza entre 4 y casi 5 grados, suficiente para que sea perceptible. Este fenómeno invita a reflexionar sobre la fragilidad y la forma de nuestro planeta, contrario al terraplanismo que niega esta evidencia científica y empírica.

Las TIE, que deben tramitarse presencialmente con toma de huellas dactilares, eran gestionadas sin ese requisito en una parte de los expedientes, y en al menos 900 ocasiones este año se omitieron las huellas mediante una práctica descrita como “anquilosis dactilar”.

Pese a las conclusiones de la CIA, que apuntan a que Bin Salmán aprobó el crimen cometido en el consulado saudí de Estambul, Trump declaró ante la prensa que el príncipe “no sabía nada al respecto” y zanjó el asunto con esa afirmación.

El mandatario estadounidense restó importancia al caso, afirmando que Khashoggi era una figura “controvertida” y sugiriendo que “las cosas pasan”, mientras destacaba su cercanía con Bin Salmán. Trump calificó al príncipe de “amigo” y elogió su cooperación en materia de derechos humanos, unas declaraciones que contrastan con las denuncias de organizaciones como Amnistía Internacional, que alertan del agravamiento de la represión y el aumento de las ejecuciones en Arabia Saudí.

Según el informe de la consultora Lucas Fox, el aumento de los precios por metro cuadrado, que ha pasado de una media de 4.000 euros a superar los 12.000 euros, ha hecho que los compradores españoles se muestren más sensibles y reduzcan su presencia en este segmento. En cambio, los inversores internacionales, acostumbrados a precios elevados en otras grandes ciudades, están asumiendo estos costes sin problema. Se prevé que en 2026, un 90% de las viviendas valoradas en más de cinco millones en España sean adquiridas por extranjeros, especialmente en Madrid, Cataluña, Baleares y Costa del Sol. El segmento de las branded residences, con servicios hoteleros de lujo y ligados a grandes marcas, es el que registra los precios más altos y gastos mensuales de comunidad elevados, que no t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-compradores-extranjeros-dominan-el-mercado-de-viviendas-de-ultralujo-en-madrid-en-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-compradores-extranjeros-dominan-el-mercado-de-viviendas-de-ultralujo-en-madrid-en-2026</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un tribunal de Tel Aviv decide mantener detenido a un niño autista agredido en prisión]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un tribunal de Tel Aviv ha decidido extender la detención de un niño de 14 años con autismo que se encontraba encarcelado bajo cargos relacionados con seguridad.

A pesar de este incidente traumático, el tribunal ha optado por mantener la medida de detención, alegando que se realizará una nueva audiencia en una semana para valorar posibles alternativas. La decisión ha provocado un intenso debate sobre la gestión de casos de menores con discapacidades en el sistema penitenciario israelí, especialmente en un contexto tan sensible como el de los cargos de seguridad.

Según analistas como Enguerrand Artaz, de La Financière de l'Échiquier, el riesgo no está tanto en la sobrevaloración bursátil, sino en el uso creciente de prácticas de ingeniería financiera y la dependencia de deuda fuera de balance. Grandes tecnológicas como Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, Amazon u Oracle han incrementado masivamente sus inversiones en IA, financiándolas a menudo mediante estructuras opacas o “mercados no cotizados”. Nvidia, por ejemplo, ha invertido en clientes como OpenAI o CoreWeave para que estos compren sus chips, lo que ha generado un ecosistema circular de inversiones cruzadas que distorsiona las métricas financieras.

Estos sistemas no solo modifican la estructura de las frases como los parafraseadores, sino que buscan introducir imprevisibilidad, discontinuidad y un estilo más personal. Mientras que los textos generados automáticamente suelen ser correctos pero fríos y mecánicos, un humanizador trata de recuperar esa esencia humana, con dudas, giros y matices propios de un escritor real. Sin embargo, los humanizadores no son perfectos. Aunque pueden mejorar la legibilidad y el estilo, a veces introducen metáforas erróneas o expresiones inadecuadas en ciertos contextos. El uso del humanizador es una herramienta útil para quienes necesitan mejorar textos rápidamente sin perder la fluidez, como estudiantes, profesionales de SEO o quienes escriben informes.

A pesar de contar con solo cinco años de experiencia profesional, ha logrado consolidar su empresa de fontanería, calefacción y reformas. Trabaja por cuenta propia y utiliza sus redes sociales, especialmente TikTok, para visibilizar su día a día y promover el oficio entre los jóvenes.

Armeli afirma que puede llegar a facturar más de 1.000 euros al día, aunque advierte que sus jornadas suelen ser de 12 horas y que los beneficios reales se reducen significativamente por los impuestos y la cuota de autónomos.

El texto recuerda el origen del proyecto a partir de una idea de Robert Kurtzman, quien propuso a Tarantino escribir el guion a cambio de los efectos especiales gratuitos para 'Reservoir Dogs'. También se detalla cómo el rodaje marcó un punto de inflexión en la carrera de George Clooney, que buscaba romper con su imagen televisiva de 'Urgencias', y cómo la icónica escena de Salma Hayek como Santanico Pandemonium nació entre nervios, tequila y una fuerte fobia a las serpientes.

El ministro Ernest Urtasun anunció esta decisión en el Congreso de los Diputados, subrayando que un gobierno democrático no puede permitir la pervivencia de organizaciones que vulneren los principios de la Ley de Memoria Democrática, en vigor desde 2022.

En el siniestro, causado por un escape masivo de grisú, murieron seis mineros y otros nueve resultaron heridos. Todos ellos eran trabajadores experimentados que quedaron sin oxígeno en cuestión de segundos, sin tiempo para usar sus equipos de emergencia. Trece años después del accidente, el tribunal ha eximido de toda responsabilidad penal a los directivos y técnicos imputados por homicidio imprudente grave y delitos contra los derechos de los trabajadores. La resolución también libera de responsabilidad civil a las aseguradoras MAPFRE España, AMIC Seguros Generales y HDI Hannover Internacional, así como a la propia compañía minera, considerada hasta ahora responsable civil subsidiaria.

Según un comunicado oficial, la medida se toma tras considerar que existen riesgos de que durante la manifestación se generen discursos de odio, humillación hacia las víctimas del franquismo y exaltación de la dictadura. Este tipo de manifestaciones podrían incitar a la violencia, tal como se demostró en incidentes ocurridos el 8 de noviembre de 2025, cuando una manifestación de ultraderecha fue disuelta por la policía tras altercados en las calles, como quema de contenedores y daños en el mobiliario urbano.

A pesar de algunas reformas legales bajo el mandato de Giorgia Meloni, como el endurecimiento de penas para la violencia doméstica y el acoso, persisten fuertes críticas desde movimientos sociales y la oposición, que acusan al gobierno de escasos avances en prevención e igualdad. Se mantiene la prohibición de la educación sexual en las escuelas, obviando las recomendaciones internacionales que la consideran clave para combatir la violencia machista y promover relaciones igualitarias desde la infancia.El contexto socioeconómico tampoco es favorable: la brecha salarial entre hombres y mujeres ronda el 40% en algunos sectores y la precariedad laboral afecta sobre todo a las mujeres jóvenes, que en muchos casos no pueden permitirse formar una familia.

Durante un registro en su domicilio, los agentes encontraron una plantación con 215 plantas de marihuana, además de cogollos ya preparados para su venta. La operación, de carácter antidroga, continúa abierta y no se descartan nuevas actuaciones. 

Saiz Martínez, que gobierna desde 2023 con mayoría absoluta tras vencer al PSOE con 75 votos frente a 60, encabezaba la lista del PP aunque no milita oficialmente en el partido. La dirección popular ha pedido su dimisión inmediata y que entregue su acta de concejal, sin esperar al desenlace del proceso judicial.

La víctima, de 32 años y madre de cuatro hijos, llegó por error a la casa de Andersen para limpiar creyendo que era su lugar de trabajo. Al intentar abrir la puerta, el acusado abrió fuego a través de ella, causándole la muerte inmediata. El suceso ocurrió el 5 de noviembre y generó atención nacional por las implicaciones de la ley estatal de 'defensa propia'. Aunque la defensa de Andersen sostiene que actuó para protegerse, el fiscal del condado, Kent Eastwood, ha afirmado que las circunstancias no justifican el uso de fuerza letal, ya que el acusado no tenía motivos razonables para creer que su vida estaba en peligro.

Entre los modelos más emblemáticos destacan el F-91W, el G-Shock DW-5000C y el modelo calculadora C-80. A lo largo de los años, Casio ha introducido características como termómetros, tensiómetros, altímetros, brújulas y hasta dispositivos para el cálculo de órbitas planetarias. Además, los relojes Casio no solo han sido funcionales, sino también han mostrado un diseño atrevido y una imaginación inusitada para su tiempo.

Tecé argumenta que Mazón no debe verse como un caso aislado o un 'monstruo', sino como un exponente más de una derecha política caracterizada por la irresponsabilidad, la manipulación y la falta de rendición de cuentas. A lo largo del texto, el autor critica que se utilice a Mazón como cabeza de turco mientras otros dirigentes del Partido Popular, como Feijóo o Ayuso, se mantienen intactos en su prestigio público pese a sus propias actuaciones cuestionables. Tecé compara este mecanismo con la estrategia que, según él, emplea la monarquía española: fomentar las críticas a Juan Carlos I para preservar la imagen de su sucesor.

Aunque no se ha confirmado la veracidad de los rumores, el contenido filtrado ha desatado una nueva ola de atención mediática sobre el caso Epstein, sumando más nombres a la lista de personas vinculadas a este escándalo, lo que ha generado aún más debate y controversia sobre los abusos cometidos por Epstein y las posibles conexiones con personajes públicos influyentes.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/filtracion-de-correos-electronicos-de-jeffrey-epstein-menciona-a-trump-y-clinton-en-rumores-sexuales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/filtracion-de-correos-electronicos-de-jeffrey-epstein-menciona-a-trump-y-clinton-en-rumores-sexuales</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yolanda Díaz propone una tasa Trump para que las grandes tecnológicas paguen impuestos en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La ministra de Trabajo y Economía de España, Yolanda Díaz, ha propuesto la implementación de una 'tasa Trump' dirigida a las cinco grandes compañías tecnológicas estadounidenses: Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Google y Apple. Según Díaz, estas empresas, que operan en Europa sin tributar, deben comenzar a pagar impuestos en España. Su argumento se basa en la injusticia que supone que empresas con enormes recursos eviten el pago de tributos, mientras los autónomos y empresas españolas se ven obligados a hacerlo. Además, Díaz destacó que estas compañías consumen gran cantidad de energía, lo que aumenta la pobreza energética en España, donde muchas familias no pueden costear las facturas de la luz. La medida también está pensada para reducir la influencia de las grandes tecnológicas de EE.UU. en el mercado europeo, y para evitar que la región quede a la sombra de China y Estados Unidos en el sector tecnológico. La ministra ya ha comenzado a negociar con el PSOE para implementar esta tasa, que po]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/yolanda-diaz-propone-una-tasa-trump-para-que-las-grandes-tecnologicas-paguen-impuestos-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/yolanda-diaz-propone-una-tasa-trump-para-que-las-grandes-tecnologicas-paguen-impuestos-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 18:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El debate innecesario sobre el vestido de Sydney Sweeney]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sydney Sweeney ha vuelto a acaparar los focos con un vestido transparente de malla metálica durante la entrega de premios de la revista Variety. La actriz, conocida por su papel en ‘Euphoria’, no es nueva en este tipo de controversias relacionadas con su estilo. A pesar de que el acto en sí no tiene nada de transgresor, las reacciones a su look siguen siendo polarizadas. Mientras unos defienden la libertad de expresión y el derecho de la actriz a elegir su vestimenta, otros consideran que debería adoptar una actitud más discreta y respetuosa con las normas sociales. En medio de esta tormenta de opiniones, lo cierto es que lo único que está en juego es la visión que tenemos sobre las mujeres y sus cuerpos, algo que sigue suscitando comentarios innecesarios. Este evento vuelve a poner sobre la mesa el debate sobre la objetificación de la mujer en los medios, y cómo los comentarios en redes sociales no hacen más que amplificar estereotipos y prejuicios.

Esta resolución pone fin a una práctica común en el sector, en la que las empresas trasladaban estos gastos a los trabajadores. La sentencia incluye la cobertura de los costes de obtención y renovación del permiso de armas y del carnet de conducir, así como el tiempo empleado en estos trámites, que deberá considerarse como jornada laboral. La demanda, presentada por el sindicato CCOO, comenzó en julio de 2025 y fue seguida de una batalla judicial que culminó con la aceptación de la sentencia por parte de Prosegur. El sindicato celebra la victoria, calificando esta resolución como un paso importante para poner fin a una práctica injusta y extendida en el sector de la seguridad privada.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prosegur-debe-cubrir-los-costes-de-carnet-de-conducir-y-permiso-de-armas-para-sus-vigilantes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/prosegur-debe-cubrir-los-costes-de-carnet-de-conducir-y-permiso-de-armas-para-sus-vigilantes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las hermanas de Caparrós acceden a los documentos secretos sobre el asesinato de 1977 tras casi 50 años de lucha]]></title><description><![CDATA[Las hermanas de Manuel José García Caparrós, el joven sindicalista que fue asesinado por la policía durante una manifestación en Málaga en 1977, han conseguido acceder a la documentación secreta sobre su muerte, tras décadas de lucha. Caparrós fue abatido por un disparo en el torso en una manifestación por la autonomía andaluza, pero las autoridades inicialmente trataron de encubrir su asesinato, haciéndolo pasar por un accidente de tráfico. Las hermanas han estado buscando respuestas durante 48 años, enfrentándose a barreras legales y burocráticas que impedían el acceso a los archivos. Finalmente, gracias a la Ley de Memoria Democrática y a la aprobación de una nueva normativa en el Congreso, las hermanas han podido consultar los documentos clasificados relacionados con la investigación del asesinato, entre ellos, las actas de la comisión parlamentaria que se formó en 1978. Este acceso a los archivos podría arrojar luz sobre los responsables del asesinato y contribuir a la reparación ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-hermanas-de-caparros-acceden-a-los-documentos-secretos-sobre-el-asesinato-de-1977-tras-casi-50-anos-de-lucha</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-hermanas-de-caparros-acceden-a-los-documentos-secretos-sobre-el-asesinato-de-1977-tras-casi-50-anos-de-lucha</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Informes revelan torturas y detenciones con violaciones en prisiones israelíes durante el conflicto]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un mes después del alto el fuego en Gaza, surgen nuevos informes que señalan torturas y muertes bajo custodia de palestinos detenidos en prisiones de Israel, además de violaciones sexuales descritas por testimonios de víctimas y organizaciones de derechos humanos. El informe del PHRI indica al menos 94 palestinos muertos bajo custodia entre octubre de 2023 y agosto de 2025, con 46 fallecidos en instalaciones del Servicio de Prisiones de Israel y 52 bajo custodia militar. Estas muertes se acompañan de casos de negligencia médica grave, desnutrición y falta de notificación a familias o al CICR, dificultando investigaciones y exámenes post-mortem. Paralelamente, testimonios difundidos por CPDH detallan torturas sexuales sistemáticas, incluyendo violaciones, desnudamiento forzado y agresiones con objetos, algunas de las cuales habrían ocurrido en prisiones de Gaza y en el marco de detenciones recientes.

Entre 2005 y 2022, al menos 1.800 agentes fueron acusados de delitos relacionados con el abuso sexual infantil, aunque esta cifra podría ser solo la punta del iceberg, ya que muchos casos no se han denunciado o han pasado desapercibidos. La mayoría de las víctimas eran adolescentes, y muchos de los abusos se perpetraron cuando los agentes estaban de servicio, utilizando su puesto para acercarse a las víctimas. El informe también destaca fallos sistémicos dentro del sistema judicial que permiten que estos abusos continúen, incluidos la falta de procesos de selección adecuados para prevenir la entrada de potenciales abusadores en las fuerzas de seguridad, la ausencia de un sistema nacional de seguimiento de agentes acusados, y la escasa r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-revela-el-abuso-sexual-infantil-por-parte-de-agentes-de-policia-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-revela-el-abuso-sexual-infantil-por-parte-de-agentes-de-policia-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google presenta WeatherNext 2, su modelo de predicción meteorológica más preciso y rápido]]></title><description><![CDATA[Google DeepMind y Google Research han lanzado WeatherNext 2, un modelo de inteligencia artificial que promete revolucionar las predicciones meteorológicas.

Durante la rueda de prensa, cuando se le preguntó sobre la conexión entre él y Epstein, Trump perdió la calma y, en un tono despectivo, le dijo a la reportera 'Cállate, cerdita'. Este episodio ocurrió pocos días antes de que Trump anunciara un cambio de postura sobre la liberación de los archivos de Epstein. La noticia ha generado gran polémica, ya que el expresidente ha sido vinculado anteriormente con Epstein, aunque él ha negado cualquier implicación en sus crímenes.

La medida, que busca prevenir la ocupación ilegal de viviendas, prevé sanciones de hasta 750 euros. Sin embargo, esta decisión ha generado una fuerte polémica, ya que los vecinos consideran que la medida castiga a las personas más vulnerables, especialmente a quienes dependen del agua pública gratuita. Una plataforma vecinal, 'Alianza por el acceso al agua', ha iniciado una campaña en contra de la normativa, argumentando que no hay justificación económica ni de seguridad para esta prohibición. Además, denuncian que el gobierno local ha cerrado las fuentes de agua sin un motivo claro, lo que agrava la situación de quienes no pueden pagar por agua embotellada o por servicios privados.

La investigación, que se publicó en la revista 'Aggression and Violent Behavior', revela cómo este grupo ha evolucionado desde sus orígenes en los años 90 como una comunidad de apoyo, hasta convertirse en una subcultura misógina que culpa a las mujeres y promueve el odio hacia ellas. A través de un lenguaje deshumanizador y un espacio en las redes sociales, los 'Incels' transforman su frustración en odio, catalogando a las mujeres con términos como 'ganado' o 'contenedores de esperma'. El estudio también resalta los problemas de salud mental de los 'Incels', como la soledad, la baja autoestima, y la depresión.
