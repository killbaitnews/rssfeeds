The initiative reportedly faced strong opposition from high-ranking U.S. military officers, who warned that such an operation would be both illegal and politically disastrous without congressional authorization. The Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) was said to have been tasked with drafting the plan, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff resisted, expressing concerns about international law and domestic repercussions.

Diplomatic sources quoted in the report described internal frustration among senior generals, with some claiming they tried to redirect Trump’s attention to other military priorities such as countering Russian ‘ghost ships’ or targeting Iranian assets. The push for a Greenland operation was reportedly influenced by hardline advisors in ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reportedly-considered-military-plans-for-greenland-meeting-resistance-from-top-generals</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reportedly-considered-military-plans-for-greenland-meeting-resistance-from-top-generals</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 11:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minneapolis Pastor Says ICE Released Him After Racially Charged Comment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pastor Kenny Callaghan of Minneapolis recounted a disturbing interaction with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers during protests following the fatal shooting of a woman by an ICE agent. According to Callaghan, agents shoved and handcuffed him before placing him in the back of an SUV. He said that after being detained, the officers mocked him, asking if he was afraid, to which he responded defiantly. Eventually, they released him, allegedly saying that because he was white, detaining him 'wouldn’t be any fun.' The event occurred near protests against the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman shot by an ICE officer. Federal officials have not confirmed Callaghan’s account. The report situates the incident within a larger political context under the Trump administration, noting concerns about racial bias, extremist rhetoric, and the acceleration of aggressive immigration enforcement.

Among those detained were children as young as 10 years old and some who were already injured at the time of arrest, with many held in administrative detention without formal charges. The report states that around 350 children are still in Israeli prisons, where they are said to be deprived of education and subjected to long sentences and harsh conditions, including torture, starvation, lack of medical care, and restrictions on family visits.

The article then shifts to developments in France, highlighting a draft law proposed by French MP Caroline Yadan that would criminalize speaking negatively about the State of Israel if approved by the National Assembly, with debate scheduled for 20 January.

In an alleged CNN interview, Miller supposedly claimed that the United States, as a superpower, has the right to act to secure its strategic interests and prevent neighboring countries from supplying resources to its adversaries. He is also quoted asserting that 'sovereign countries have no sovereignty if the U.S. wants their resources,' a statement described by Congressman Seth Moulton as 'delusional' and 'deeply disturbing.' Miller’s comments reportedly followed similarly aggressive declarations by U.S. ambassador Michael Waltz at a United Nations Security Council emergency meeting, warning that Washington would not allow key global energy reserves to remain under the control of America's rivals. The article links these remarks to ongoing tensions over Trump’s stance toward countries such as V]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-miller-sparks-controversy-over-u-s-foreign-policy-and-greenland-remarks</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/stephen-miller-sparks-controversy-over-u-s-foreign-policy-and-greenland-remarks</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 09:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Severe Arctic Cold Wave Disrupts Transport and Energy Across Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[A powerful polar cold wave has severely impacted much of Europe, causing major transportation disruptions, widespread power outages, and dangerous conditions across multiple countries. The French meteorological service reported that this is one of the most intense cold spells in at least eight years, with temperatures dropping 12–15°C below seasonal averages across Central, Western, and Southwestern Europe. France saw mass flight cancellations, with around 40% of flights scrapped at Charles de Gaulle Airport and 25% at Orly. Many regions restricted heavy truck circulation, and Nantes Airport halted operations completely. In the Netherlands, about 2,000 flights were canceled at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, forcing over a thousand passengers to spend the night in terminals. Railway and port operations were also heavily affected, and parts of Rotterdam Port stopped container handling due to snow. In Germany, Berlin residents reportedly faced power cuts lasting up to four days, while in t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/severe-arctic-cold-wave-disrupts-transport-and-energy-across-europe</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/severe-arctic-cold-wave-disrupts-transport-and-energy-across-europe</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 08:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pro-Trump Communities Protest Against ICE Mega-Detention Center Plans]]></title><description><![CDATA[Several predominantly pro-Trump towns across the United States are reacting angrily to federal plans to build massive new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers in their communities. The initiative, promoted by President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, aims to replace the current network of local and private jails with a centralized system of large-scale industrial-style facilities. Internal documents and public tenders describe seven regional complexes, each capable of housing between 5,000 and 10,000 detainees, and sixteen smaller sites for up to 1,500 people each—mirroring an 'Amazon-style' logistics model applied to immigration enforcement. 

However, the plan has triggered strong local opposition, particularly in Republican strongholds such as Social Circle, Georgia, where residents expressed outrage at hosting a 9,000-person facility in a town of only 5,000 inhabitants. Concerns include overstressed infrastructure, inadequate emergen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pro-trump-communities-protest-against-ice-mega-detention-center-plans</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pro-trump-communities-protest-against-ice-mega-detention-center-plans</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eric Schmidt to Build Lazuli: The First Large Private Space Telescope]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has announced plans to fund Lazuli, the first large privately financed space telescope in history. Scheduled for launch in 2028 aboard Relativity Space’s Terran R rocket, Lazuli (or Lazuli Space Observatory, LSO) will feature a 3.1-meter off-axis primary mirror, making it one of the largest space telescopes ever constructed—second only to the James Webb Space Telescope. The project aims to deliver cutting-edge astronomical research comparable to NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, focusing on deep-space imaging, the study of exoplanets, dark energy, and dark matter. Lazuli will carry three main instruments: the Widefield Context Camera (WCC), the Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), and the ExtraSolar Coronograph (ESC), capable of capturing visible and near-infrared light between 350 and 1700 nanometers. The telescope’s orbit will be a high elliptical path ranging from 70,000 to 285,000 kilometers, synchronized with the Moon to ensure thermal stability and ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eric-schmidt-to-build-lazuli-the-first-large-private-space-telescope</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eric-schmidt-to-build-lazuli-the-first-large-private-space-telescope</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Protests Intensify Across Iran as Death Toll Rises and Internet Blackout Deepens]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article covers the expansion of mass protests across Iran that have resulted in at least 78 deaths and more than 2,600 arrests over two weeks, according to the US-based group HRANA. Demonstrations erupted in late December 2025 amid worsening economic conditions and have spread to over 180 cities in all 31 provinces. Eyewitnesses and doctors described hospitals overflowing with wounded protesters and victims shot at close range, including children and bystanders. In Tehran, social media videos show large crowds chanting anti-government slogans such as 'Death to the Dictator' and 'Long live the Shah,' while some buildings, banks, and mosques were set on fire. Despite a near-total internet blackout imposed by authorities, protests continue, with some Iranians reportedly using alternative communication methods like contraband Starlink terminals.

Venezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves, exceeding 300 billion barrels, representing about 17% of global reserves, and ranks eighth globally in natural gas reserves, exceeding 200 trillion cubic meters—six times greater than U.S. reserves. The country is also rich in critical minerals such as gold, diamonds, nickel, and coltan, drawing increasing attention from major powers. The emergence of lithium as an essential element for electric vehicles and energy storage has heightened the geopolitical significance of Venezuela, which is believed to have strong lithium potential due to its proximity to South America’s “lithium triangle” (Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina), which contains most of the world’s reserves. The article emphasizes that the United States views lithium as a strategic asset in its technological and trade competition with China,]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-s-strategic-role-in-global-energy-and-mineral-resources</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-s-strategic-role-in-global-energy-and-mineral-resources</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Incorrectly States China Doesn’t Use Wind Power Despite Being the Global Leader]]></title><description><![CDATA[During a meeting with U.S. oil executives, President Donald Trump claimed that China does not use wind power within its borders and only manufactures wind turbines to sell to other countries such as Europe and the United States. He criticized wind energy, saying that windmills are inefficient, harm landscapes, and kill birds. While Trump accurately described China as a leader in wind turbine manufacturing, he falsely asserted that China itself does not operate any wind farms.

In reality, data shows China is the world’s foremost user of wind power, holding nearly half of global installed capacity. By early 2025, the country operated around 444,000 megawatts of wind energy, representing about 44% of worldwide capacity—nearly triple that of the United States. This figure continued to grow through 2024, even as other nations slowed the development of large-scale renewable projects.

Trump’s comments echo similar claims he made in earlier speeches, including at the UN General Assembly, whe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-incorrectly-states-china-doesn-t-use-wind-power-despite-being-the-global-leader</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-incorrectly-states-china-doesn-t-use-wind-power-despite-being-the-global-leader</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 04:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Haaretz Report Details the Role of Israeli Minors in West Bank Settler Violence Against Palestinians]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to an investigation by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, settlers in the occupied West Bank increasingly deploy groups of Israeli minors, some as young as twelve, to harass and intimidate Palestinian communities. These minors operate from illegal settlement outposts, entering Palestinian villages on foot or by vehicle to vandalize property, destroy water infrastructure, and threaten residents. Their repeated incursions, both day and night, aim to exhaust Palestinian families into leaving their homes. Haaretz reports that this activity forms part of a strategic campaign to displace Palestinians while expanding settler control over land traditionally used for grazing and agriculture. The attacks often follow a coordinated pattern in which minors engage in harassment and destruction over time, paving the way for armed adult settlers to escalate the violence.

The operation has caused alarm in the Indigenous community, where residents accuse ICE agents of racial profiling and targeting Native people who are U.S. citizens. The raids took place primarily in the south side of Minneapolis, a historically Native American neighborhood centered around the Little Earth housing community, the first urban Native housing project in the United States. 

One Indigenous woman, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by ICE agents on Wednesday, sparking nationwide protests. Reports describe ICE agents entering Native housing areas, detaining people under bridges, and attempting to question tribal leaders and activists. In one case, Rachel Dionne-Thunder, a co-founder of the Indigenous Peoples’ Movement, recorded ICE ag]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ice-raids-in-minneapolis-spark-concern-over-wrongful-detentions-of-native-americans</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ice-raids-in-minneapolis-spark-concern-over-wrongful-detentions-of-native-americans</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 02:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discovery of a 17th-Century Glass Artifact in a Former German Convent]]></title><description><![CDATA[Archaeologists excavating a former convent in Herford, Germany, made an unexpected discovery — a 20-centimeter glass object shaped like a phallus, dating to the 16th or 17th century. Initially assumed to have scandalous implications, the artifact, dubbed the 'Glass Phallus of Herford,' is now thought to have served a symbolic or ceremonial function rather than an erotic one. Researchers suggest it could have been a novelty drinking vessel used in elite social gatherings, where humor, satire, and irony played significant roles in Renaissance culture. The find highlights how daily life in early modern convents — often home to noble women — included education, music, and festivities, challenging modern assumptions about strict religious austerity.

The object is displayed in the LWL Museum of Archaeology and Culture in Herne, continuing to intrigue historians and visitors. It also appears in Guido Kleinhubbert’s book Düstere Geheimnisse ('Dark Secrets'), which examines mysterious artifact]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discovery-of-a-17th-century-glass-artifact-in-a-former-german-convent</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discovery-of-a-17th-century-glass-artifact-in-a-former-german-convent</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 23:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former CIA Double Agent Aldrich Ames Dies in U.S. Prison at 84]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aldrich Ames, a former CIA counterintelligence officer who was one of the most damaging moles in U.S. intelligence history, has died in an American prison at the age of 84. During his three-decade career with the CIA, Ames was responsible for identifying foreign infiltration attempts and protecting American sources abroad. However, in the mid-1980s, he began selling highly classified information to the Soviet Union (and later to Russia) in exchange for more than $2.5 million. His betrayal exposed numerous covert operations, led to the arrest of several U.S. agents, and significantly compromised American intelligence capabilities at the end of the Cold War.

Ames and his wife lived far beyond their means, buying luxury cars and maintaining international bank accounts, which eventually drew the attention of investigators. Arrested in 1994, Ames confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, while his wife served several years in prison.

The controversy escalated after Trump, now 79 and in his second term, boasted on Truth Social about scoring '100%' on a third cognitive exam. Medical analyst Dr. Vin Gupta criticized the president’s repeated tests, stating that the frequency of such assessments could indicate ongoing monitoring of cognitive decline rather than routine evaluation. He noted that it is rare for a healthy individual to take the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) multiple times unless early-stage dementia is suspected.

Psychologist Dr. John Gartner echoed these concerns, emphasizing that repeating the same cognitive test is generally done to track the progression of dementia, not to confirm normal function. He also suggested that Trump’s increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior could reflect signs of cognitive deterioration.

The Crew Dragon Endeavour will depart from the International Space Station (ISS) carrying Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui, and Oleg Platonov, leaving the Soyuz MS-28 crew—Sergei Kud-Sverchkov, Sergei Mikayev, and Christopher Williams—in orbit. This is the first time in ISS history that a spacecraft returns prematurely for medical reasons, though similar events have occurred earlier in spaceflight history. In 1976, during the Soyuz 21 mission, cosmonaut Vitali Zholobov’s deteriorating psychological state forced an early end to the mission aboard the Salyut 5 station. Later, in 1985, commander Vladimir Vasyutin of Soyuz T-14 suffered a prostate-related infection that led to an unscheduled return from Salyut 7.

Initially introduced as a tool for managing labor and immigration controls, the program could expand to encompass all citizens from birth. According to the report, each baby would receive a digital identification linked to their medical record, enabling unified access to state services such as child benefits, healthcare, and education applications. Supporters argue that it would modernize bureaucracy, while critics see it as a step toward pervasive state surveillance. Human rights organizations, including Big Brother Watch, have voiced strong concerns, calling the plan a serious threat to civil liberties.

Although the Rule of St Benedict placed little priority on material comfort, cold climates forced monks to develop ways to cope in winter. Monks lived by strict principles of poverty, humility, and communal discipline, and personal ownership was forbidden. Comfort was considered spiritually dangerous, so enduring cold often symbolized devotion and endurance. Still, some practical concessions existed—such as heavier wool cowls in winter and the construction of special heated rooms when possible. The only room in most monasteries with a fire was the calefactorium, or warming room, where monks could briefly gather for warmth. These rooms were rare and valued, as dormitories, churches, and refectories remained unheated.

The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office decided that federal agencies would handle the case without involving Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) or state prosecutors. This decision prevents state officials from accessing key evidence, including reports, witness statements, and physical materials from the scene, effectively blocking Minnesota from conducting an independent investigation.

Minnesota’s Department of Public Safety Commissioner Ben Jacobson and Governor Tim Walz both condemned the move, arguing it undermines transparency and accountability.

Diagnosed with acute kidney disease in 2022, she relies on Affordable Care Act (ACA) insurance to afford her treatments. Without the subsidies, her monthly premium will more than double, putting her medical care beyond reach. Her story mirrors that of more than 22 million Americans, particularly in Republican-led states like Florida, Texas, and Mississippi, who depend on the same financial assistance to maintain coverage.

Congress remains gridlocked over whether to extend the ACA subsidies.

Good, who was a poet, mother of three, and U.S. citizen, seems calm in the video, speaking politely as Ross films around her car. At one point, other agents rush toward the vehicle, shouting for her to get out. Good then reverses and steers away from the agents. Ross, appearing to be almost clear of the SUV’s route, fires three shots while muttering an expletive. The video contradicts the Department of Homeland Security’s claim that Ross acted in self‑defense after being charged by the vehicle.

Charli, who was allegedly released under suspicious circumstances during the government's crackdown on gangs, granted a public interview to the investigative outlet El Faro. In the interview, he described how gang representatives began communicating with Bukele’s close allies around 2014, when he planned his political rise from mayor of San Salvador to the presidency. Charli asserts that Bukele’s intermediaries, like Carlos Marroquín ('Slip'), offered community benefits and advance warnings about police operations in exchange for electoral support. The gangs purportedly helped secure votes for Bukele and intimidated opposition groups. 

The report contrasts the secret political alliances with Bukele’s later war on gangs, launched in Mar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/former-gang-leader-details-alleged-deals-between-bukele-s-government-and-salvadoran-gangs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/former-gang-leader-details-alleged-deals-between-bukele-s-government-and-salvadoran-gangs</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[European Commission to Develop Strategy for Scaling Open Source Software and Boosting Digital Sovereignty]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Commission is developing a new strategy to transform European open source software into commercially viable alternatives to major U.S. technology providers. This initiative aims to strengthen the European Union’s digital sovereignty, ensuring that value generated within open source communities remains inside the EU rather than benefiting international tech giants. The forthcoming strategy, set to be released alongside the Cloud and AI Development Act (CAIDA) in early 2026, focuses on scaling communities, supporting industrial deployment, improving market integration, and ensuring the financial sustainability of key open source projects. The Commission acknowledges that while past EU-funded research efforts have had positive outcomes, they have not been enough to help European software compete globally at commercial scale.

The analysis, led by researchers from the University of Lancashire and supported by the NIHR Applied Research Collaboration North-West Coast, reviewed 73 randomized controlled trials with nearly 5,000 adult participants diagnosed with depression. Compared with no treatment, regular exercise showed noticeable improvements in mood and mental health. When compared with psychological therapies, the effect of exercise was similar, supported by moderate-quality evidence. Its comparison with antidepressant medication also suggested a similar benefit, although the certainty of this evidence remains low due to small sample sizes. The review notes that exercise is a low-cost, accessible intervention with few reported side effects—mainly mild musculoskeletal injuries—whereas antidepressants often cause fatigue or gastroint]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exercise-shown-to-moderately-reduce-depressive-symptoms-in-comparison-with-therapy-and-medication</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exercise-shown-to-moderately-reduce-depressive-symptoms-in-comparison-with-therapy-and-medication</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 04:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeremy Corbyn Criticizes UK Support for US Actions in Venezuela and Calls for Ethical Foreign Policy]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this opinion piece, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn denounces the British government’s failure to condemn the United States for its unprovoked military attack on Venezuela. Corbyn draws parallels between Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s response to the Venezuelan crisis and Tony Blair’s support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He argues that both instances demonstrate the UK’s unwillingness to uphold international law when it conflicts with US interests. The article accuses Starmer, a former lawyer, of choosing political convenience over legal and moral principles by avoiding criticism of Donald Trump’s actions. According to Corbyn, the UK’s silence over an illegal bombing and the abduction of a sitting president shows that Britain remains dependent on Washington and has forsaken its duty to defend sovereignty and justice. Corbyn also rejects the justification of ‘democratic transition,’ noting that US interventions historically lead to suffering rather than stability.

The meeting, intended to secure $100 billion in investments for Venezuela’s energy reconstruction, gathered executives from Chevron, Exxon, Halliburton, Valero, and Marathon at the White House. While promising profitability from the proposed deal, Trump received a note from Rubio and, apparently unaware it was private, read it to the entire room, instructing an executive from Chevron to speak. The moment caused visible discomfort among attendees and drew renewed attention to Trump’s increasingly erratic behavior and signs of cognitive decline. According to energy officials, Chevron remains the only U.S. company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with Petróleos de Venezuela.

It explains that producers sought performers who could reflect the dark humor and charm of Charles Addams’ original cartoons, and that many moments from the auditions were captured in striking black and white photographs by Bill Ray for LIFE magazine. John Astin was first considered for the role of the butler, Lurch, as early plans envisioned the show centered around the servant character, but after a discussion with executive producer David Levy, Astin was recast as the family patriarch and even allowed to choose the name Gomez instead of Repelli.

However, the piece argues that the agreement actually facilitates the continuation of the conflict rather than its resolution. The meeting in Paris included representatives from France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey, Poland, the United States, the European Union, and NATO. Ultimately, only France and the UK signed, while Turkey agreed to manage a ceasefire zone in the Black Sea and the U.S. verbally supported the initiative without signing. Germany, Canada, Italy, and Poland refused to endorse the agreement.

He begins by tracing the origins of geopolitical thinking back to simulated war games and strategic mapping, comparing them to chess with real political consequences. Grijalvo notes the popularization of geopolitical discussions through media figures such as Colonel Pedro Baños on YouTube, and he views this growing public interest as positive, even if often superficial. The article then delves into the concept of hemispheres—northern vs. southern, western vs. eastern—and how these divisions reflect not only cartographic conventions but also deep historical and ideological divides, from European colonialism to the modern notion of the 'Global North' and 'Global South'.

La afirmación se produjo tras compartir una publicación que pronosticaba ese escenario. A continuación, Trump advirtió a las autoridades cubanas de que ya no recibirán más dinero ni petróleo de Venezuela, alegando que La Habana ha dependido durante años del crudo y los fondos venezolanos a cambio de apoyo en seguridad a los gobiernos de Hugo Chávez y Nicolás Maduro. El mandatario instó a la isla a llegar a 'un acuerdo antes de que sea demasiado tarde', sin detallar en qué consistiría dicho pacto.

En un vídeo difundido por visitantes del recinto, se observa a un muntjac chino macho —una especie de ciervo de pequeño tamaño originaria de Asia— enfrentarse a un rinoceronte que supera ampliamente su tamaño y peso, con más de 1,7 toneladas. A primera vista, la escena parece insólita, pero según el personal del zoológico, tiene una explicación biológica bastante lógica.

Los cuidadores del parque explicaron que la hembra de muntjac se encontraba en celo, lo que activó el comportamiento territorial del macho. Este tipo de conducta es habitual entre los muntjacs, que suelen mostrar agresividad para defender su espacio o su pareja durante el periodo reproductivo. Aunque el enfrentamiento con un animal tan grande como un rinoceronte resulta inofensivo para este último, el vídeo muestra cómo el pequeño ciervo se planta con seguridad, sin mostrar miedo.

Dávila criticó la falta de recursos de seguridad y reclamó más dispositivos de protección, como las pulseras antimaltrato, argumentando que Madrid es la comunidad que menos apoyo recibe por número de víctimas. Sin embargo, los datos presupuestarios muestran una tendencia regresiva en las partidas autonómicas dedicadas a igualdad y atención a las víctimas. 

En 2026, la Comunidad de Madrid destina 38,26 millones de euros al área de Igualdad, frente a los 39,85 millones de 2025 y los 40,53 millones de 2024, a pesar de que el Gobierno de España ha incrementado sus transferencias en más de un 25%.

El incidente, ocurrido mientras Good intentaba alejarse en su coche, fue grabado por varias cámaras y ha provocado una fuerte indignación tanto en Minnesota como en otras ciudades del país.

Miles de manifestantes salieron a las calles durante el fin de semana en urbes como Los Ángeles, San Francisco, Salt Lake City y Portland, exigiendo una investigación independiente y denunciando el uso excesivo de la fuerza por parte de los agentes federales. En Mineápolis, la situación se tensó cuando el DHS desplegó más de 2.000 agentes en lo que describió como su ‘mayor operación de control’ hasta la fecha, generando enfrentamientos con los manifestantes y algunas detenciones.

La población activa ha caído hasta las 436.200 personas, un 4 % menos que en el mismo periodo de 2024, mientras que el número de ocupados se ha reducido a 382.000, lo que supone una disminución del 6,7 %. Por el contrario, la población inactiva ha aumentado un 7,16 %, alcanzando las 311.300 personas. El número de desempleados ha crecido notablemente: 54.000 personas se encuentran en situación de paro, con una tasa del 12,4 %, frente al 9,9 % del año anterior. Desde Compromís, el concejal Ferran Puchades ha atribuido esta tendencia negativa al “fracaso de las políticas de ocupación del PP y Vox” en el Ayuntamiento de València.

Autor de más de una veintena de libros, Von Däniken alcanzó la fama internacional en 1968 con 'Recuerdos del Futuro', obra en la que defendía que culturas antiguas como la egipcia o la maya habían recibido conocimientos tecnológicos avanzados de seres de otros planetas. Su propuesta, rechazada por la comunidad científica, fascinó sin embargo a millones de lectores y dio origen a una corriente popular de pseudociencia que perdura hasta hoy. 
A lo largo de su vida, vendió más de 60 millones de ejemplares en 32 idiomas, consolidándose como una figura clave dentro de la literatura de misterio y teorías alternativas.

Basándose en la definición del historiador Robert Paxton, destaca que el asalto al Capitolio en enero de 2021 marcó la transición hacia un fenómeno propiamente fascista. Hustvedt argumenta que este tipo de política se alimenta de sentimientos de victimismo y declive, canalizados hacia la exaltación de la pureza, la unidad y la masculinidad. En su visión, el trumpismo recupera los mitos viriles del fascismo clásico —la virilidad heroica, el nacionalismo agresivo y el desprecio hacia las minorías y la igualdad de género— y los reinterpreta a través de la cultura MAGA, que transforma a Trump en un símbolo semidivino de fuerza y autoridad.

Esta cifra representa un incremento del 54 % respecto a 2011, cuando se contabilizaban 3.092 templos. El auge del evangelismo se asocia en gran parte a la inmigración latinoamericana, que encuentra en estas comunidades un espacio religioso y social de referencia. Las nuevas aperturas, unas cinco por semana, se concentran principalmente en Catalunya, Madrid y Andalucía. El evangelismo se caracteriza por su énfasis en la lectura de la Biblia como autoridad suprema, la conversión personal, el bautismo de creyentes y la evangelización activa. Algunos analistas apuntan a que determinados sectores evangélicos, especialmente los vinculados al pentecostalismo, mantienen afinidades ideológicas con partidos de extrema derecha, debido a coincidencias en temas como el rechazo al aborto, la oposición al matrimonio igualita]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-iglesias-evangelicas-duplican-a-las-mezquitas-en-espana-y-crecen-entre-la-poblacion-inmigrante</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-iglesias-evangelicas-duplican-a-las-mezquitas-en-espana-y-crecen-entre-la-poblacion-inmigrante</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 06:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resumen meteorológico de España y Canarias del 13 al 19 de octubre de 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante la semana del 13 al 19 de octubre de 2025, el régimen euroatlántico estuvo dominado por un patrón de bloqueo escandinavo y una dorsal atlántica que condicionaron la meteorología en la Península, Baleares y Canarias.

En el ámbito interno, su gobierno ha militarizado la gestión de la inmigración, reforzado la persecución de los indocumentados, debilitado las políticas sociales, medioambientales y de igualdad, y emprendido una venganza política contra jueces, medios y adversarios.

Según el autor, esta información es falsa y manipulada, ya que el expresidente no tuvo ningún papel en el caso. En realidad, se trató de un intercambio de presos entre Venezuela y Estados Unidos, donde cada país decidió los nombres de los detenidos que formarían parte del acuerdo.

Relata su participación como consultor en 2002 y cómo fue testigo directo de las primeras transformaciones sociales que beneficiaron a millones de personas antes marginadas, a quienes se les otorgó por primera vez una identidad legal y acceso a servicios básicos. Torres destaca que, en sus inicios, la izquierda española mostró escepticismo hacia el chavismo, al considerarlo un movimiento militarista y populista, aunque con el tiempo cambió su postura y terminó apoyando el proceso, aunque con escasa autocrítica. El autor también subraya cómo desde dentro del movimiento se advirtieron signos de corrupción y autoritarismo que, en su opinión, terminaron deteriorando los ideales originales de la revolución.

En 2014, tras una década alejado de los escenarios, Bowie sorprendió con The Next Day, pero un diagnóstico de cáncer de hígado le hizo entender que su tiempo era limitado. A pesar del mal pronóstico, el músico inglés trabajó en su último disco, que lanzó el 8 de enero de 2016, coincidiendo con su cumpleaños número 69, y falleció solo dos días después. Blackstar se considera un reflejo perfecto de su carrera: un trabajo complejo, hermoso e inesperado que fusiona jazz, rock y reflexiones vitales sobre la muerte y la despedida. Pocas veces un artista ha creado un álbum sabiendo que sería su testamento sonoro, como hicieron Bowie y Leonard Cohen en sus últimos meses. Tony Visconti, productor y socio de Bowie, destacó que le alegra que este disco figure entre sus mejores obras, permitiendo que se fuera como una leyen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/diez-anos-de-la-muerte-de-bowie-y-su-album-blackstar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/diez-anos-de-la-muerte-de-bowie-y-su-album-blackstar</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 22:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nueve especies críticas en España que necesitan medidas urgentes de conservación]]></title><description><![CDATA[España enfrenta una grave crisis de biodiversidad con más de 200 especies amenazadas y alrededor de 140 consideradas vulnerables. Entre las más críticas hay nueve especies cuya situación es especialmente alarmante, debido a factores como la destrucción de hábitats, el cambio climático o la introducción de especies invasoras. Entre los mamíferos destacan el visón europeo, del que apenas quedan unos 142 ejemplares concentrados principalmente en Navarra, y el desmán ibérico, reducido a cinco núcleos poblacionales que sufren la degradación de los ríos y la contaminación. En cuanto a las aves, la focha moruna, el alcaudón chico, la cerceta pardilla y el urogallo cantábrico presentan una regresión preocupante por la pérdida de humedales, la agricultura intensiva, el uso de pesticidas y los incendios. La situación de la focha moruna, en particular, se considera crítica por la desaparición de los humedales del sur peninsular.

La propuesta provocó una fuerte oposición entre los altos mandos militares, quienes advirtieron que la acción sería ilegal sin la aprobación del Congreso y podría generar una grave crisis diplomática con Europa. Fuentes diplomáticas señalaron que los generales consideraban la idea temeraria e intentaron desviar la atención de Trump hacia otras operaciones menos polémicas, como la vigilancia de buques rusos que eluden sanciones o eventuales acciones contra Irán. El impulso detrás del plan estaría motivado tanto por razones estratégicas —el control del Ártico y la competencia con Rusia y China— como por cálculos políticos internos ante las próximas elecciones legislativas.

Antes de la llegada masiva de los CD-ROM, muchos usuarios tuvieron que instalarlo mediante nada menos que 28 disquetes de 3,5 pulgadas, cada uno con una capacidad de apenas 1,44 MB. En total, el sistema ocupaba unos 40 MB, una cifra considerable para la época. El proceso de instalación era largo y tedioso: había que insertar y cambiar los disquetes uno tras otro, siguiendo las instrucciones en pantalla con cuidado. Si un solo disquete estaba dañado, toda la instalación podía quedar interrumpida, lo que obligaba a empezar desde el principio. La paciencia era una virtud imprescindible para cualquier usuario doméstico de mediados de los noventa. Con el tiempo, la versión en CD-ROM simplificó enormemente el proceso y se convirtió en la opción preferida por la mayoría, aunque aquellos ordenadores sin lector de CD siguieron dependiendo de los disquetes.

Callaghan explicó que se unió a la manifestación cuando se enteró de la muerte de la mujer, identificada como Renee Nicole Good, e intentó interceder cuando vio que los agentes rodeaban a una joven latina. Durante el enfrentamiento, uno de los oficiales le apuntó con un arma y le preguntó si tenía miedo, a lo que él respondió que no.

Aunque la medida pretende combatir la pornografía infantil en internet, la propuesta plantea que las plataformas de mensajería escaneen voluntariamente las comunicaciones privadas de los usuarios para detectar contenido ilegal. Este enfoque, conocido como 'Chat Control', permitiría la instalación de un software en los dispositivos de los usuarios para analizar los mensajes antes de que sean cifrados, lo que, según múltiples expertos, supone una grave amenaza a la privacidad y a los derechos fundamentales. El artículo compara esta estrategia con el uso masivo de programas espía como Pegasus, destacando que el sistema podría implicar vigilancia sin orden judicial.

Esta operación, ocurrida pocas horas antes de la captura de Nicolás Maduro por fuerzas especiales de Estados Unidos, habría generado ganancias estimadas en 400.000 dólares a partir de una inversión inicial de 30.000.

Sin embargo, la agencia Lusa Verifica, tras una investigación de verificación, ha demostrado que esta afirmación es falsa. El análisis del entorno de la imagen, realizado mediante técnicas de geolocalización, determinó que la foto no procede de Irán, sino de un aparcamiento en la ciudad de Richmond Hill, en los alrededores de Toronto (Canadá).

En el artículo se destaca una de sus ideas clave: las convicciones más arraigadas, aquellas que menos nos hacen dudar, son precisamente las más sospechosas. Según Ortega, estas creencias profundas no surgen de un razonamiento crítico, sino que forman parte del sustrato de nuestra vida cotidiana, de lo que damos por sentado sin cuestionar. Distingue entre 'ideas', que son pensamientos elaborados y discutibles, y 'creencias', que son el fundamento mismo de nuestra existencia, tan radicadas que las confundimos con la realidad misma. El filósofo argumenta que la verdadera vitalidad intelectual radica en la duda, en cuestionar esas bases inamovibles para evitar el dogmatismo. Ortega ilustra esto con ejemplos cotidianos: creemos en la solidez del suelo bajo nuestros pies o en la permanencia de nuestro entorno sin pensarlo, pero es pre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reflexion-de-ortega-y-gasset-sobre-las-convicciones-y-la-duda</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-reflexion-de-ortega-y-gasset-sobre-las-convicciones-y-la-duda</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 17:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los Mercedes W123, vehículos esenciales en los campamentos saharauis de Tinduf]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hace cincuenta años, en 1975, Marruecos inició la ocupación del Sáhara Occidental, lo que provocó el éxodo masivo de la población saharaui hacia la hamada de Tinduf, una región desértica e inhóspita en Argelia.

YouTube, según Lacort, muestra anuncios más largos, frecuentes e invasivos que interrumpen vídeos y canciones en los momentos más inoportunos, buscando que el usuario se sienta frustrado y opte por pagar la versión sin anuncios.

Aunque las reglas monásticas, especialmente la Regla de San Benito, promovían la austeridad y la renuncia a los placeres materiales, la realidad del clima obligó a los religiosos a buscar formas prácticas de combatir el frío. San Benito, escribiendo en la Italia del siglo VI, reconocía que en regiones más frías los monjes necesitarían ropa adicional, aunque en la práctica solo se permitía una cogulla más gruesa en invierno. En el norte de Europa, donde las temperaturas eran mucho más bajas, la vida en los monasterios se volvía especialmente dura. Las iglesias y dormitorios no tenían calefacción y solo existía un espacio con fuego: el calefactorio o sala de calentamiento. Este lugar, normalmente junto al refectorio, era el único donde los monjes podían reunirse alrededor del fuego para recuperar algo de calor.

Desde mediados de diciembre, Irán ha sufrido un aumento del malestar social motivado por la caída del valor del rial, el encarecimiento de los combustibles y la escasez de agua. Las protestas se han extendido por todo el país, reflejando el descontento general de la población ante la crisis económica. La declaración del Mossad se produce tan solo meses después de un conflicto armado de 12 días en junio, en el que, según fuentes israelíes, agentes del Mossad participaro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mossad-publica-un-inusual-mensaje-en-farsi-apoyando-las-protestas-en-iran</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-mossad-publica-un-inusual-mensaje-en-farsi-apoyando-las-protestas-en-iran</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 15:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La influencia del periodismo sensacionalista estadounidense en la guerra de 1898 y su impacto en Cuba]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, escrito por Sabdiel Batista Díaz, analiza cómo la difusión de noticias falsas por parte de la prensa estadounidense durante la Guerra Hispano-Cubano-Norteamericana (1895-1898) contribuyó a justificar la intervención militar de Estados Unidos en Cuba. Según el autor, medios como el New York Journal, de William Randolph Hearst, y el New York World, de Joseph Pulitzer, promovieron un periodismo sensacionalista que exageraba o inventaba hechos para despertar emociones y vender más ejemplares, iniciando así la era del “periodismo amarillo”. Ejemplos destacados incluyen el 'caso Olivette', donde se inventó un registro humillante de una joven cubana por funcionarios españoles; la manipulación del rescate de Evangelina Cossío, presentado como una epopeya heroica; y la tergiversación de la explosión del acorazado USS Maine, atribuida falsamente a las fuerzas españolas, lo que desató un fervor bélico con el lema “Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!”.

En plataformas como X (antes Twitter), algunos internautas aplaudieron la ocurrencia, calificándola de 'trato inteligente' o 'acuerdo perfecto', incluso compartiendo imágenes generadas con inteligencia artificial de la supuesta pareja o hipotéticos hijos.

En su intervención, Trump afirmó que China no utiliza energía procedente del viento y que las turbinas que fabrica se destinan únicamente a su exportación hacia países como Estados Unidos y las naciones europeas, a las que calificó de “pardillos”. Sin embargo, los datos oficiales desmienten categóricamente esta declaración: China no solo produce la mayoría de los componentes de los aerogeneradores, sino que también lidera el uso global de esta fuente de energía renovable. Según cifras de 2025, el país contaba con una capacidad operativa de unos 444.000 megavatios, lo que equivale a aproximadamente el 44% del total mundial, casi el triple que Estados Unidos.

Estos jóvenes llegan a pie, en vehículos todoterreno o con tractores, destruyen depósitos de agua, cercas y paneles solares, y en algunos casos agreden físicamente a residentes y activistas israelíes que intentan documentar los ataques. Haaretz señala que esta práctica forma parte de una estrategia planificada de desplazamiento forzado: los menores mantienen un acoso constante para desgastar a las comunidades, y posteriormente adultos armados ejecutan ataques más violentos que obligan a las familias a huir.

En su análisis, explica que la infancia atraviesa un profundo sufrimiento psíquico derivado de la presencia masiva de las pantallas y de la ausencia emocional de los adultos. Según Knobel Freud, la introducción temprana del teléfono móvil —entre los 9 y 11 años— supone un error que sustituye el papel del padre o la madre por el del dispositivo, que pasa a dictar las normas y a ofrecer una falsa sensación de control. El resultado es una generación con menos creatividad, menos juego y mayor soledad.

Este movimiento marca un paso significativo para la industria tecnológica, ya que por primera vez un gran fabricante estadounidense opta por proveedores chinos en un segmento tradicionalmente dominado por Samsung, SK Hynix y Micron. CXMT, que ha desarrollado memorias DDR5 y LPDDR5X de alto rendimiento con velocidades de hasta 8.000 y 10.667 MT/s respectivamente, se perfila como una alternativa sólida gracias a su creciente capacidad de producción, estimada en unas 300.000 obleas mensuales. Aunque su volumen todavía no iguala al de los líderes del sector, ya representa una oferta relevante para cubrir necesidades parciales de fabricantes OEM, incluidos HP, Dell y Lenovo. La medida también refleja una tendencia: mientras las grandes compañías coreanas y estadounidenses priorizan ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hp-recurrira-a-fabricantes-chinos-como-cxmt-para-reducir-la-escasez-de-memoria-dram</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/hp-recurrira-a-fabricantes-chinos-como-cxmt-para-reducir-la-escasez-de-memoria-dram</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 07:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tucker Carlson critica que Estados Unidos actúa como un imperio tras su ofensiva contra Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El periodista estadounidense Tucker Carlson declaró en una entrevista con la periodista Megyn Kelly que el reciente ataque de Estados Unidos contra Venezuela marca, en su opinión, la transición del país norteamericano de una república a un imperio. Según Carlson, esta evolución se caracteriza por la concentración del poder en el Ejecutivo y la pérdida de relevancia del Congreso, cuyo papel considera cada vez más simbólico e ignorado en la toma de decisiones. Argumentó que estas acciones reflejan una política exterior más directa y sin disimulos, en la que Washington ya no oculta sus motivaciones geopolíticas y económicas. En este sentido, señaló que el verdadero motivo de la ofensiva no es la lucha contra el narcotráfico, sino el interés por hacerse con los recursos petroleros venezolanos, especialmente ante la competencia de China. Desde Caracas, el ministro venezolano Diosdado Cabello respaldó esta interpretación, afirmando que Estados Unidos busca apropiarse de las riquezas naturale]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tucker-carlson-critica-que-estados-unidos-actua-como-un-imperio-tras-su-ofensiva-contra-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tucker-carlson-critica-que-estados-unidos-actua-como-un-imperio-tras-su-ofensiva-contra-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Casos históricos de misiones espaciales interrumpidas por problemas médicos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La NASA ha decidido adelantar el regreso de la misión Crew-11 debido a un problema médico de uno de los cuatro astronautas, un hecho inédito en la historia de la Estación Espacial Internacional (ISS). La nave Crew Dragon Endeavour llevará de vuelta a Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Kimiya Yui y Oleg Platónov, dejando a la tripulación rusa-estadounidense de la Soyuz MS-28 a bordo. Aunque nunca antes una misión de la ISS había finalizado antes por razones médicas, existen precedentes en la era soviética. 

El primero ocurrió en 1976 con la Soyuz 21, cuando el cosmonauta Vitali Zhólobov sufrió un grave deterioro psicológico tras una serie de fallos eléctricos en la estación militar Salyut 5. A pesar de los esfuerzos por continuar la misión, los médicos decidieron evacuar a la tripulación anticipadamente. Un segundo caso tuvo lugar en 1985 con la Soyuz T-14: Vladímir Vasyutin enfermó de la próstata mientras servía en la Salyut 7, lo que obligó a adelantar el regreso. En 1987, durante la misión ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/casos-historicos-de-misiones-espaciales-interrumpidas-por-problemas-medicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/casos-historicos-de-misiones-espaciales-interrumpidas-por-problemas-medicos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 06:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Controversia en Argentina por los incendios en la Patagonia y la respuesta del gobierno de Milei]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo aborda los recientes incendios en la provincia argentina de Chubut, iniciados en enero de 2026, que han devastado miles de hectáreas y provocado evacuaciones masivas. A partir de este hecho, la autora desarrolla una narrativa que mezcla hechos comprobables —como los recortes presupuestarios del gobierno de Javier Milei que debilitaron la capacidad de respuesta ambiental y de los bomberos— con teorías conspirativas de carácter antisemita relacionadas con un supuesto plan israelí para dominar la Patagonia. La pieza cita incidentes antiguos protagonizados por turistas israelíes en Chile y Argentina y los conecta con la llamada 'teoría del Plan Andinia', una idea infundada nacida en los años setenta que sugiere la creación de un segundo Estado judío en el sur de Sudamérica. Aunque el texto expone datos sobre la crisis ambiental y la precariedad del sistema de gestión de incendios en Argentina, su tono deriva hacia la especulación, presentando acusaciones graves sin evidencias v]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-argentina-por-los-incendios-en-la-patagonia-y-la-respuesta-del-gobierno-de-milei</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-argentina-por-los-incendios-en-la-patagonia-y-la-respuesta-del-gobierno-de-milei</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China condena las acciones de Estados Unidos en Venezuela y refuerza sus lazos con África y Corea del Sur]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 7 de enero de 2026, la portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de China, Mao Ning, ofreció una conferencia de prensa en la que abordó temas de gran relevancia internacional. Comenzó destacando la tradicional visita del ministro de Exteriores Wang Yi a África, con motivo del 70.º aniversario de las relaciones diplomáticas sino-africanas y la inauguración del Año de Intercambios de Pueblo a Pueblo China-África. Subrayó el compromiso de China con la cooperación estratégica con Etiopía, Somalia, Tanzania y Lesoto. En materia latinoamericana, Mao Ning denunció con contundencia las acciones de Estados Unidos contra Venezuela, incluido el supuesto secuestro del presidente Nicolás Maduro y su esposa. Calificó estas acciones de violaciones del derecho internacional y exigió su liberación inmediata, reafirmando que la cooperación entre China y Venezuela se basa en el respeto mutuo y el derecho internacional.

Este sistema combina las propiedades de un superfluido (flujo sin fricción) con un orden cristalino, es decir, una modulación periódica en la densidad que rompe la simetría de traslación espacial. El experimento parte de un condensado de Bose–Einstein de polaritones en una guía de ondas fabricada con una aleación de AlGaAs, estructurada con una rejilla sublongitud de onda que permite manipular los modos de propagación de la luz acoplada a excitones. Mediante la excitación del sistema con un láser ultrarrápido a 770 nm y el enfriamiento a unos 4 K, se genera el condensado polaritónico fundamental (modo |0⟩). Al aumentar la potencia del láser, se produce una oscilación paramétrica óptica isoenergética, que dispersa polaritones hacia dos modos simétricos (|±1⟩), generando un patrón de interferencia estable —una huella ex]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/observacion-experimental-de-un-supersolido-de-polaritones-en-un-cristal-fotonico-semiconductor</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/observacion-experimental-de-un-supersolido-de-polaritones-en-un-cristal-fotonico-semiconductor</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 05:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El juez Antonio Piña inicia diligencias previas para determinar si se investiga a Zapatero por su relación con el Gobierno de Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El magistrado Antonio Piña, de la Audiencia Nacional, ha ordenado la apertura de diligencias previas contra José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero tras una querella interpuesta por la asociación Hazte Oír. La organización acusa al expresidente del Gobierno de mantener vínculos con el régimen de Nicolás Maduro que podrían implicar delitos de blanqueo de capitales, tráfico de drogas y pertenencia a organización criminal. En su resolución, el juez considera que las acusaciones presentan indicios que justifican la incoación de diligencias y solicita al Ministerio Fiscal que se pronuncie sobre la competencia de la Audiencia Nacional para investigar los hechos. Hazte Oír también ha solicitado como medidas urgentes la retirada del pasaporte de Zapatero y la prohibición de salida del territorio español, así como la citación como testigos de José Luis Ábalos, Koldo García y el empresario Víctor de Aldama.

Velasco tenía 15 años cuando comenzó a colaborar con la parroquia de San José Obrero, donde el sacerdote aprovechó su posición de confianza para abusar de él entre 2001 y 2004. Tras años de silencio, culpa y graves secuelas psicológicas, Velasco ha encontrado cierta reparación simbólica gracias al reciente acuerdo firmado entre el Gobierno español y la Conferencia Episcopal Española (CEE), que busca resarcir a las víctimas cuyos casos han prescrito o cuyos agresores han fallecido. Este acuerdo, impulsado también por el Vaticano y asociaciones de víctimas, surge tras el exhaustivo informe del Defensor del Pueblo que estima en 440.000 las personas abusadas por el clero, un 1,13% de la población.

El suceso tuvo lugar el miércoles por la mañana, y las autoridades federales —el FBI y la Oficina del Fiscal de los Estados Unidos— han decidido dirigir por completo la investigación, sin colaboración con las agencias estatales o locales. Esto impide al estado acceder a las pruebas, informes y entrevistas clave, limitando significativamente su capacidad para valorar posibles cargos contra el agente implicado, identificado como Jonathan Ross. 

El gobernador de Minnesota, Tim Walz, criticó duramente la decisión, argumentando que el estado no confía en que el Gobierno federal realice una investigación imparcial. También pidió que los agentes federales se retiraran del estado, y subrayó la importancia de una investigación independiente y tra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-federal-asume-en-exclusiva-la-investigacion-del-tiroteo-mortal-del-ice-en-minneapolis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-federal-asume-en-exclusiva-la-investigacion-del-tiroteo-mortal-del-ice-en-minneapolis</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 04:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE.

La medida, anunciada por la secretaria de Agricultura, Brooke Rollins, se produce tras descubrirse un presunto fraude masivo en la gestión de programas de asistencia social y nutrición financiados con dinero público. Según el Departamento de Agricultura, el esquema habría permitido el desvío de miles de millones de dólares durante los últimos años, incluyendo fondos asignados durante la pandemia del COVID-19. Rollins acusó a las autoridades de Minnesota de no presentar un plan creíble para detener la corrupción y aseguró que los recursos no se restablecerán hasta que se demuestre que el fraude ha cesado completamente.

Cámaras de seguridad registraron parte del asalto, donde se aprecia cómo el hombre es derribado, pateado y golpeado repetidamente. Los agresores también incendiaron y destruyeron cuatro vehículos pertenecientes al vivero, que ya había sido atacado en dos ocasiones previas durante el último año. El incidente se suma a una ola creciente de violencia por parte de colonos israelíes contra palestinos, especialmente durante la temporada de recolección de aceitunas.

Estos bombardeos se produjeron tras el lanzamiento de un proyectil desde Gaza que, según Israel, cayó dentro del propio territorio palestino y fue considerado por las autoridades israelíes como una violación del alto el fuego vigente. Hamas no ha reivindicado este lanzamiento.

En un comunicado conjunto, las Fuerzas de Defensa de Israel (FDI) y el servicio de inteligencia Shin Bet explicaron que los ataques se dirigieron contra “terroristas e infraestructuras terroristas” pertenecientes a Hamas, afectando enclaves en el norte y el sur de la Franja.

El yacimiento de Kvanefjeld alberga una de las mayores reservas mundiales de tierras raras, uranio y torio. En 2021, el partido inuit Ataqatigiit prohibió su explotación por motivos medioambientales, una medida que ETM considera una expropiación y que ha impugnado ante tribunales internacionales, reclamando más de 11.000 millones de dólares, cifra que multiplica por cuatro el PIB de Groenlandia.

Según informó la fiscalía del condado de Delaware, el acusado sustraía restos humanos de mausoleos y bóvedas selladas que databan de hace varios siglos. En su vivienda y en una nave de su propiedad, la policía encontró cráneos, huesos, manos y pies momificados, así como torsos parcialmente descompuestos. Algunos de estos restos habían sido colocados o colgados en diferentes estados de conservación, lo que sugiere una manipulación deliberada de los cadáveres. 

Gerlach fue arrestado cuando regresaba a su coche portando una palanca y una bolsa que contenía restos momificados de dos niños pequeños junto con tres cráneos y varios huesos.

Wolff plantea que dichos sucesos, lejos de reflejar una demostración de fuerza por parte de Estados Unidos y sus aliados, expresan más bien los síntomas de su debilidad estructural. Según el economista, la política exterior norteamericana lleva años recurriendo a estrategias agresivas y desestabilizadoras para mantener su influencia global, especialmente en regiones que considera estratégicas como América Latina.

Martínez sostiene que este episodio no solo representa una nueva aplicación de la Doctrina Monroe, sino también una redefinición del poder imperial de Estados Unidos en América Latina. Según el análisis, el golpe habría contado con la colaboración de sectores del chavismo, en especial del entorno de Delcy y Jorge Rodríguez, que habrían aceptado un acuerdo tácito con Washington para garantizar su permanencia parcial en el poder, dando lugar a lo que el autor califica como una situación de 'una y media dictaduras' en el país.

Según los investigadores, se absorbieron 23 zettajulios de energía, el equivalente a la cantidad de energía consumida por la humanidad durante 37 años. Esta acumulación de calor oceánico (OHC) confirma la tendencia sostenida al calentamiento global y convierte a los océanos en el mayor reservorio térmico de la Tierra, ya que absorben más del 90 % del exceso de calor causado por los gases de efecto invernadero. Los datos proceden de instituciones de Asia, Europa y América, como el Instituto de Física Atmosférica de la Academia China de Ciencias, Copernicus Marine y la NOAA/NCEI.

Kennedy Jr. La guía, vinculada al movimiento 'Make America Healthy Again', pretende revolucionar las recomendaciones dietéticas con una pirámide invertida, aunque Sánchez considera que esta decisión tiene un propósito más simbólico y propagandístico que científico. Según el experto, la propuesta mezcla mensajes populistas con decisiones de marketing, sin introducir cambios significativos en relación con versiones anteriores. 

Entre las principales críticas, destaca la incoherencia entre el texto de las directrices y la imagen que lo acompaña: la representación gráfica otorga protagonismo a la carne y los lácteos, mientras minimiza los cereales integrales, que sin embargo el texto recomienda consumir con frecuencia.

Esta práctica redujo drásticamente el tipo aplicado —de 222 euros por cada 1.000 litros a apenas 0,56 euros por tonelada métrica—, generando un perjuicio de más de 7,7 millones de euros a las arcas públicas canarias.

El mensaje, recuperado por redes sociales y medios, decía: “Quien se mete con Diosdado se mete con Maduro. Quien se mete con Maduro se mete con Chávez. Quien se mete con Chávez se mete con Venezuela”. Este comentario contrasta fuertemente con la postura actual de Ayuso, férrea crítica del Gobierno de Nicolás Maduro y defensora de la oposición venezolana. 

El contexto del tuit se remonta a un momento en que Estados Unidos investigaba a altos funcionarios venezolanos, como Diosdado Cabello, por presunto narcotráfico y lavado de dinero.

La IA se presenta ahora como una capacidad integrada de serie, explicando qué hace realmente el equipo por el usuario, sin etiquetas vacías.

Anexionado en 1898, el archipiélago ocupó un lugar complejo dentro de la historia norteamericana, marcado por tensiones entre identidad local y política imperial. Durante la primera mitad del siglo XX, los habitantes de Hawái solicitaron repetidamente la condición de estado, con la esperanza de elegir su propio gobernador y participar de forma directa en las decisiones federales.

Mientras el Gobierno de Emmanuel Macron mantenía silencio, la líder del Reagrupamiento Nacional (RN), Marine Le Pen, criticó duramente la acción de Washington y apeló al respeto de la soberanía nacional. Le Pen reivindicó la doctrina gaullista, recordando que Francia debe ser aliada de Estados Unidos, pero siempre preservando su independencia en materia de política exterior. Esta postura fue reforzada por su mano derecha, Louis Aliot, quien consideró inaceptable que un jefe de Estado sea detenido por un comando extranjero, incluso si se trata de un líder como Maduro, con quien el RN no comparte afinidades ideológicas.

La reacción del RN contrasta con la prudencia del presidente Macron y refleja una tendencia creciente en la extrema derecha francesa: un distanciamiento estratégico de la órbita de Donald Trump.

La grabación, obtenida por el medio Alpha News y analizada por The Advocate, muestra que Ross no se encontraba en inminente peligro cuando abrió fuego contra el vehículo de Good. En las imágenes se observa a la mujer comportándose de forma tranquila y conciliadora durante la interacción, mientras su esposa, Becca Good, grababa la escena. El vídeo muestra que Ross ya se había apartado del camino del coche cuando disparó tres veces, en aparente contradicción con la versión oficial que describía una acción en defensa propia ante una supuesta embestida del vehículo.

La denuncia acusa a Zapatero de estar presuntamente vinculado a una estructura criminal liderada por Nicolás Maduro y le atribuye posibles delitos de tráfico de drogas, blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal. Esta decisión se produce poco después de que el Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos informara de que no podía probar la existencia del llamado 'Cartel de los Soles', término utilizado en Venezuela para referirse a funcionarios corruptos, pero no a una organización criminal estructurada. A pesar de esa aclaración, Piña ha ordenado la apertura de diligencias y ha solicitado a la Fiscalía que se pronuncie sobre la continuidad del proceso.

La medida busca dar respuesta a la preocupación de muchas familias inmigrantes que temen enviar a sus hijos a la escuela mientras continúan las operaciones federales. Según informó el propio distrito, los docentes impartirán sus lecciones desde las aulas, combinando la enseñanza presencial y virtual. El plan, de carácter temporal, se extenderá hasta el 12 de febrero.
El anuncio se realizó a través de un correo electrónico interno a los profesores, al que tuvo acceso Associated Press. El contexto de esta decisión se enmarca en la llegada de unos 2.000 agentes federales enviados por el Gobierno del presidente Donald Trump y por las tensiones provocadas tras la muerte de una mujer abatida por un agente migratorio en la misma semana.

En una publicación en Truth Social, el mandatario de 79 años aseguró que los médicos de la Casa Blanca le habían descrito en 'perfecta salud', lo que, según el Dr. Vin Gupta, médico analista de NBC News, podría ser un indicio preocupante. Gupta explicó que repetir con tanta frecuencia el test cognitivo MoCA suele ser una señal de que los médicos están vigilando un posible deterioro cognitivo o demencia temprana, y no simplemente realizando exámenes rutinarios. Otros especialistas, como el psicólogo John Gartner, coinciden en que la repetición del test sugiere seguimiento de una enfermedad más que prevención.

La sanción se debe a la negativa de la empresa estadounidense a integrarse en el sistema Piracy Shield, una plataforma creada por las autoridades italianas para gestionar de forma centralizada el bloqueo de contenidos considerados piratas. Este sistema obliga a los proveedores de Internet, redes móviles, resolutores DNS y servicios VPN a aplicar restricciones sobre sitios web denunciados por infringir derechos de autor. Desde marzo de 2024, AGCOM había requerido en varias ocasiones a Cloudflare que registrara sus servicios en la plataforma para ejecutar los bloqueos exigidos. Ante la falta de respuesta, el organismo ordenó bloquear más de 15.000 dominios y direcciones IP, pero en junio de 2025 constató que la compañía seguía sin obedecer.

Guetté denunció en la red social X lo que calificó como el “secuestro” del presidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro, el apoyo militar estadounidense a “un genocidio en Palestina”, las amenazas de “anexión armada” sobre Groenlandia y los bombardeos que, según ella, violan las leyes internacionales.

Su tesis central es que la narrativa de una Venezuela próspera antes del chavismo no se corresponde con los datos históricos. Durante las décadas de 1980 y 1990, el país experimentó una profunda crisis económica, elevados niveles de pobreza y una marcada desigualdad social. Según cifras del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo y el Banco Mundial, más de dos tercios de la población vivía bajo el umbral de pobreza en 1999, y el coeficiente de Gini alcanzaba valores cercanos a 0,5, reflejando una fuerte concentración de riqueza en manos de una élite minoritaria. El auge petrolero de los años 70 generó una aparente bonanza económica que se desmoronó con la caída de los precios del crudo, dejando una economía dependiente y poco diversificada.

En la nota, Rubio sugería que se retomara la conversación con los representantes de Chevron, algo que desató una escena incómoda en la sala.

Según The New York Times, este cambio implica que ya no se considera a Maduro líder de una organización de narcotráfico, sino parte de un sistema de corrupción y clientelismo alimentado por el dinero del narcotráfico. La acusación original, presentada en 2020 bajo la administración de Donald Trump, había vinculado directamente a Maduro y a altos mandos militares chavistas con el tráfico de cocaína hacia Estados Unidos y Europa. Durante la administración de Joe Biden, el Departamento de Estado y el Tesoro usaron esta narrativa para justificar sanciones y designaciones internacionales.

Bosch señaló que utilizar términos como 'captura' o 'detención' para describir un hecho que, según él, constituye un secuestro, supone otorgar legitimidad jurídica a una acción que no la tiene. Para el jurista, llamar 'detención' a lo que en realidad es la privación forzosa de libertad en el domicilio de una persona es una manipulación del lenguaje que suaviza y encubre la ilegalidad del acto. 

Bosch insistió en que las palabras importan y subrayó el riesgo que conlleva tergiversar los significados en el discurso público, ya que ello puede influir en la percepción social y jurídica de los hechos.

En publicaciones difundidas en redes sociales, el medio calificó a la víctima como 'zurda enferma mental' y 'desquiciada', afirmando que fue correctamente abatida 'en defensa propia'.

Según fuentes citadas por la cadena CBS, Good murió cuando su vehículo trató de bloquear una calle durante un control migratorio.

Los investigadores grabaron los primeros 100 segundos tras la llegada a casa de 31 cuidadores para analizar el comportamiento de saludo de los gatos. Aunque el tamaño de la muestra fue reducido, el hallazgo principal indica que los gatos emiten más vocalizaciones —maullidos y otros sonidos— cuando la persona que regresa a casa es un hombre. En concreto, los felinos realizaron una media de 4,3 vocalizaciones en saludos a cuidadores varones, frente a 1,8 cuando se trataba de mujeres. 

Según los investigadores, esta diferencia podría deberse a las variaciones en el estilo comunicativo entre hombres y mujeres.

La agente formaba parte del dispositivo de seguridad y, al recibir aviso de posibles hurtos de móviles, persiguió a un grupo de jóvenes. Al acercarse a uno de ellos, utilizó su defensa extensible golpeando por la espalda y en la cara a la víctima, creyendo que era un ladrón. Al instante se descubrió que se trataba de un compañero del operativo. Tras un juicio en la Audiencia Provincial de Madrid y recursos posteriores, el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid confirmó la condena por un delito de lesiones, imponiendo una multa de 1.450 euros y la obligación de indemnizar con más de 18.000 euros al agente agredido.

Según Soberón, la producción anual en la región andino-amazónica alcanza unas 2.700 toneladas métricas de clorhidrato de cocaína, cultivadas principalmente en Colombia, Perú y Bolivia, mientras que el número de consumidores mundiales asciende a unos 23 millones. A su juicio, los principales consumidores siguen siendo Estados Unidos, Europa Occidental y Brasil, y la ruta dominante de tráfico pasa por México y el océano Pacífico, que hoy canalizan el 70 % del flujo hacia Norteamérica. El Caribe, antaño un corredor clave, se ha visto desplazado debido al fuerte control marítimo y aéreo de Estados Unidos y Europa.

Según Reich, el propósito ético de toda sociedad civilizada es impedir que los poderosos ataquen y exploten a los más débiles. Este principio, que inspiró los documentos fundacionales de Estados Unidos y el orden internacional posterior a la Segunda Guerra Mundial, se ve cada vez más erosionado por la concentración del poder económico y político.
Reich conecta los recientes acontecimientos –como la incursión de Trump en Venezuela, sus amenazas hacia Cuba, Colombia y Groenlandia, y su intento de golpe de Estado hace cinco años– con una tendencia global en la que líderes autoritarios y grandes corporaciones actúan sin rendir cuentas. Esta dinámica, argumenta, debilita las normas legales y morales que sosti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/robert-reich-advierte-sobre-el-impacto-de-las-politicas-de-trump-en-el-orden-civilizado-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/robert-reich-advierte-sobre-el-impacto-de-las-politicas-de-trump-en-el-orden-civilizado-global</guid><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 00:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Comité de Ética de la Cámara concluye que Matt Gaetz tuvo una conducta sexual inapropiada y consumió drogas durante su etapa en el Congreso]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Comité de Ética de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos publicó un informe en el que afirma haber hallado 'pruebas sustanciales' de que el excongresista republicano Matt Gaetz mantuvo relaciones sexuales con una menor de 17 años en 2017 y que pagó regularmente a mujeres por sexo mientras ejercía su cargo. El informe también indica que Gaetz consumió drogas ilegales, como cocaína y éxtasis, entre 2017 y 2019, y aceptó regalos no permitidos, incluyendo un viaje a las Bahamas. El documento, de 42 páginas, concluye que el comportamiento de Gaetz fue deshonroso y violó normas de conducta del Congreso y leyes estatales y federales.

El informe detalla que Gaetz pagó decenas de miles de dólares a mujeres, en parte vinculados a actividades sexuales o consumo de drogas.

Entre los beneficiarios se encuentra Rudy Giuliani, antiguo abogado personal de Trump, quien desempeñó un papel destacado en la promoción de teorías de fraude electoral y en la organización de acciones legales y políticas destinadas a cuestionar los resultados electorales. Estos indultos se producen en un contexto de tensión política persistente en EE.UU., donde las disputas sobre la legitimidad de las elecciones de 2020 continúan siendo un tema divisivo. La medida ha generado fuertes reacciones tanto de partidarios como de críticos: algunos la consideran un acto de clemencia presidencial dentro de sus prerrogativas, mientras que otros la ven como un intento de proteger a aliados que participaron en maniobras ilegales o cuestionables para alterar los resultados democráticos.

París teme que el enfoque europeo incremente los costes para los consumidores franceses y limite su soberanía energética. Según el operador RTE, las infraestructuras de interconexión se financian mediante tarifas que suponen aproximadamente una cuarta parte del recibo eléctrico en Francia. La Comisión Europea propone destinar un 25% de los ingresos por congestión (beneficios generados cuando las líneas eléctricas están saturadas) a financiar nuevos proyectos europeos, lo que reduciría el alivio económico para los usuarios franceses. Además, Francia teme que un mayor flujo de electricidad renovable y barata desde España provoque una caída en los precios mayoristas de la energía, afectando la rentabilidad de su parque nuclear.

Según las autoridades del ICE, el agente actuó en defensa propia cuando Good presuntamente trató de huir con su vehículo y amenazó su seguridad. Sin embargo, las autoridades locales, incluido el alcalde de Mineápolis, Jacob Frey, rechazan esta versión y califican el tiroteo como una acción injustificada. Videos difundidos muestran cómo los agentes intentaron detener a la mujer, cuyo coche quedó bloqueado, antes de que un disparo acabase con su vida.

El Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica considera que las actuaciones actuales, como el aporte de arena valorado en seis millones de euros, son solo soluciones temporales. La única forma de dar estabilidad, según el MITECO, sería retrasar el paseo unos 100 metros tierra adentro, aunque esto implicaría demoler hasta 300 edificios.

Su trabajo revela que, al tatuarse la piel, parte de la tinta no se queda únicamente en el lugar del tatuaje, sino que viaja a través del sistema linfático y se acumula en los ganglios linfáticos. Allí, las células defensivas, como los macrófagos, intentan eliminarla sin éxito, lo que provoca una inflamación que puede volverse crónica. Según González, esta inflamación persistente podría estar relacionada con un mayor riesgo de desarrollar ciertos tipos de cáncer, como el melanoma o el linfoma. Aunque insiste en que no se trata de alarmar, sí subraya la necesidad de seguir investigando el impacto de los tatuajes en la salud.

El texto sostiene que la creciente cooperación energética y financiera entre Venezuela y China —basada en intercambios de petróleo por infraestructuras y acuerdos denominados en monedas alternativas— debilita el papel central del dólar en el comercio internacional de energía.

Este esquema implica que las furgonetas de Amazon se centrarán en llevar lotes de paquetes a los comercios colaboradores, en lugar de realizar entregas individuales puerta a puerta, lo que reduciría drásticamente el número de vehículos y repartidores nec]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-impulsa-en-espana-un-sistema-de-reparto-a-domicilio-a-traves-de-pequenos-comercios-locales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-impulsa-en-espana-un-sistema-de-reparto-a-domicilio-a-traves-de-pequenos-comercios-locales</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Críticas del PP a la ausencia de Sánchez en la Pascua Militar pese a su asistencia a una cumbre internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda la polémica generada tras las declaraciones de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, líder del Partido Popular, al criticar que el presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, no acudiera al tradicional desfile de la Pascua Militar celebrado el 6 de enero. Feijóo reprochó esta ausencia pese a que Sánchez se encontraba participando en una cumbre internacional de alto nivel, en un contexto geopolítico especialmente sensible y con la presencia de líderes internacionales como Emmanuel Macron, Keir Starmer, Volodímir Zelenski o Mark Rutte.

El artículo, publicado en la sección Tremending de Público, adopta un tono claramente irónico y crítico con la postura del PP, subrayando lo que considera una contradicción política y una falta de visión internacional por parte de la derecha española. Se señala que la crítica de Feijóo se ve amplificada por determinados medios afines, como La Razón, que llegaron a hablar de un 'plante a la Zarzuela', alimentando así una narrativa de confrontación institucio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-del-pp-a-la-ausencia-de-sanchez-en-la-pascua-militar-pese-a-su-asistencia-a-una-cumbre-internacional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-del-pp-a-la-ausencia-de-sanchez-en-la-pascua-militar-pese-a-su-asistencia-a-una-cumbre-internacional</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 23:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rusia envía un submarino para acompañar a un petrolero implicado en sanciones en el Atlántico Norte]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rusia ha desplegado un submarino y otros recursos navales para escoltar a un petrolero que estaba siendo seguido por la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos en el Atlántico Norte, elevando la tensión entre ambos países. El buque, inicialmente llamado Bella 1 y recientemente renombrado Marinera, está vinculado al transporte de petróleo sancionado de Venezuela. Según informes de The Wall Street Journal, Moscú tomó la decisión de involucrarse directamente para proteger al petrolero y disuadir un posible abordaje estadounidense. Durante la persecución, la tripulación cambió la bandera del barco a Rusia y su nombre, lo que genera un conflicto legal sobre su estatus bajo el derecho internacional. Estados Unidos argumenta que inicialmente el barco era “sin bandera”, lo que permitía su abordaje, mientras que el registro ruso actual lo protege bajo su pabellón. Este incidente se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de sanciones occidentales, evasión de transporte de crudo y disputas sobre la denomina]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-envia-un-submarino-para-acompanar-a-un-petrolero-implicado-en-sanciones-en-el-atlantico-norte</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rusia-envia-un-submarino-para-acompanar-a-un-petrolero-implicado-en-sanciones-en-el-atlantico-norte</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez tras la reunión de la Coalición de Voluntarios por Ucrania]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo recoge la comparecencia de Pedro Sánchez tras una reunión internacional de países y actores que apoyan a Ucrania, en la que informa sobre los acuerdos alcanzados, la posición de España respecto al conflicto y el respaldo político, diplomático y posiblemente humanitario o militar al Gobierno ucraniano.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-tras-la-reunion-de-la-coalicion-de-voluntarios-por-ucrania</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-tras-la-reunion-de-la-coalicion-de-voluntarios-por-ucrania</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 21:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El exsenador Carles Mulet denuncia a Fran Rivera por solicitar una intervención extranjera en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[El torero Francisco Rivera Ordóñez, conocido como Fran Rivera, ha sido denunciado por el exsenador de Compromís, Carles Mulet, ante la Fiscalía Provincial de Castellón. Mulet considera que unas declaraciones públicas del torero podrían constituir delitos graves como traición o provocación para delinquir. Los hechos se basan en un vídeo difundido en Instagram en el que Rivera agradece al expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump su actuación en Venezuela, donde supuestamente habría promovido la detención de Nicolás Maduro, a quien llama 'narcoterrorista asesino y cobarde'. En el mismo mensaje, el torero añade una frase que ha levantado la polémica: 'No pare ahora, hay que seguir, mire acá, que aquí hay cosas que huelen a chamusquina', en aparente referencia a España. 

Mulet sostiene que esas palabras suponen una incitación a una potencia extranjera a intervenir en los asuntos internos de un Estado soberano, lo que podría encajar con el delito de alta traición y otros delitos contra el o]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-exsenador-carles-mulet-denuncia-a-fran-rivera-por-solicitar-una-intervencion-extranjera-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-exsenador-carles-mulet-denuncia-a-fran-rivera-por-solicitar-una-intervencion-extranjera-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 21:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Unión Europea ante su crisis de dependencia y militarización]]></title><description><![CDATA[El politólogo español Manolo Monereo analiza en profundidad la crisis estructural de la Unión Europea (UE) y su vínculo con la hegemonía estadounidense. Según el autor, la UE ha renunciado progresivamente a la soberanía popular y económica, sustituyéndola por una política subordinada a los intereses de Washington y de la OTAN. Monereo sostiene que la guerra en Ucrania ha acelerado esta dependencia, al convertir a Europa en un actor secundario dentro de una estrategia diseñada por Estados Unidos para contener a Rusia y a China. El texto también revisa la evolución de la globalización neoliberal desde la posguerra, afirmando que los tratados europeos como Maastricht o el Acta Única fueron instrumentos para consolidar un modelo económico basado en la financiarización y el recorte de derechos sociales. En su análisis, la UE ha pasado de ser un proyecto de integración solidaria a convertirse en una estructura oligárquica y tecnocrática que reprime toda disidencia y empuja a las sociedades e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-union-europea-ante-su-crisis-de-dependencia-y-militarizacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-union-europea-ante-su-crisis-de-dependencia-y-militarizacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 14:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
