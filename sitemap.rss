In 2024, the country added about 360 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity, more than half of the world’s total additions for that year, bringing total installed renewables capacity to around 1.4 terawatts. This rapid deployment has driven innovations such as large-scale storage, virtual power plants, and new business models, yet it presents significant challenges. Integrating intermittent wind and solar requires enhanced grid flexibility, long-distance transmission from resource-rich northwest regions to demand centers on the eastern coast, and modernization of local distribution grids to handle two-way flows from rooftop solar and electric vehicles. Economically, expanding renewables necessitates substantial investments in grids, storage, and backup capacity, while ensuring that low generation costs translate into lower system-wide costs and con]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-expands-renewables-at-scale-while-strengthening-grid-and-market-reforms</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 12:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study finds NAD+ balance restoration may reverse Alzheimer's pathology and restore function in mouse models]]></title><description><![CDATA[A collaborative research team from Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center challenges the long-standing view that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is irreversible. Published online in Cell Reports Medicine on December 22, 2025, the study investigates whether advanced AD can be reversed by restoring the brain’s energy balance, specifically the NAD+ coenzyme. Using two genetically engineered mouse models that mimic human AD mutations affecting amyloid processing and tau protein, researchers observed significant disease reversal when NAD+ balance was maintained. They administered the pharmacologic agent P7C3-A20, which helps sustain NAD+ levels without causing excessive NAD+ accumulation. Results showed not only protection against AD progression but also reversal of major pathological features, including blood-brain barrier integrity, axonal integrity, neuroinflammation, neurogenesis in the hippocampus, synaptic transmi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/study-finds-nad-balance-restoration-may-reverse-alzheimer-s-pathology-and-restore-function-in-mouse-models</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iowa denies Satanic Temple’s Capitol event request amid ongoing religious discrimination dispute]]></title><description><![CDATA[For the second consecutive year, Iowa state officials have denied The Satanic Temple Iowa’s request to host a holiday event at the Iowa Capitol, a decision that has reignited debate over religious freedom and government neutrality. The Iowa Department of Administrative Services stated that the denial was 'based on the same grounds as last year,' without providing new justification. The decision arrives as the state faces a civil rights complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa, which accuses state officials—including Governor Kim Reynolds and former DAS director Adam Steen—of religious discrimination following the 2024 rejection. The ACLU argues that once the Capitol was opened to public events and displays from multiple faith groups, the state could not legally exclude The Satanic Temple due to disagreement with its beliefs. Reynolds previously defended the denial, claiming the event would be 'harmful to minors.'

The package, described as the second since Trump took office that year, is portrayed as a deliberate escalation of military preparations by the United States against China. It includes long-range offensive systems such as 82 HIMARS launchers with GMLRS and ATACMS missiles, 420 ATACMS missiles, and over 1,200 GMLRS containers. An anonymous official cited by Taiwan News suggested modern ATACMS missiles with reach up to 500 kilometers are also being supplied, placing major Taiwanese coastal regions within striking distance. The piece argues these weapons are not defensive in nature, and claims they undermine the U.S. “one China” policy and violate the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, by shifting from defensive to offensive capabilities. It contends that the sale aligns with a broader strategy to provoke China and to entangle ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-approves-largest-ever-arms-sale-to-taiwan-escalating-proxy-tensions-with-china</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-approves-largest-ever-arms-sale-to-taiwan-escalating-proxy-tensions-with-china</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's Graphene Battery Breakthrough Reframes the Global EV Race]]></title><description><![CDATA[China is rapidly advancing graphene-based battery technology, claiming ultra-fast charging, high cycle life, and high energy density that could disrupt the global EV market. The article describes graphene batteries that can reach 80% charge in under five minutes, endure more than 3,000 cycles, and deliver up to four times the energy density of traditional lithium-ion cells, while remaining cooler and safer across temperature ranges. Chinese firms such as SuperC Technology, Tunghsu Optoelectronic, and Ufine Battery are developing graphene slurries, coatings, and full-cell prototypes, with Huawei building a 100-megawatt charging station to support heavy-duty fleets. Deployment is expected to begin with commercial fleets and premium EVs around 2027, expanding into broader consumer markets by the early 2030s. The West lags in mass production and policy integration, though U.S. institutions and European initiatives show strong academic activity.

The BND director, Martin Jäger, who took the helm in September, allegedly spoke by phone with Russian intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin, a move described as extraordinary by the Berliner Zeitung. Jäger previously served as ambassador to Ukraine and publicly warned that Germany faced active threats and could see direct military conflict with Russia. The article also notes a parallel action by the UK’s MI6, whose new director Blaise Metreweli allegedly spoke with Naryshkin. Additionally, it references a March incident where the US CIA director John Ratcliffe reportedly spoke with Naryshkin to de-escalate tensions. The piece emphasizes that clandestine lines of communication remain a critical emergency channel among allied intelligence services, particularl]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-restarts-high-level-intelligence-contacts-with-russia-amid-war-tensions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-restarts-high-level-intelligence-contacts-with-russia-amid-war-tensions</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 21:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vince Zampella, influential game industry leader and co-founder of Respawn, dies at 55]]></title><description><![CDATA[Vince Zampella, a pivotal figure in the modern video game industry, passed away at the age of 55 following a fatal car crash in Altadena, California. Zampella co-founded Infinity Ward, the studio behind the original Call of Duty, and later founded Respawn Entertainment, which EA acquired in 2017. His career also included leadership roles shaping major franchises such as Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series, as well as his involvement with Battlefield during his time at EA. The news was confirmed by statements from EA, Respawn, Infinity Ward, and the Battlefield team, all praising Zampella’s influence, leadership, and lasting impact on both players and developers. As the industry reflects on his legacy, colleagues highlight how his vision and commitment to team collaboration helped redefine modern interactive entertainment and community engagement.

She sat with a placard declaring support for hunger-striking Palestine Action prisoners and opposing alleged genocide. The demonstration also involved two other activists who used red paint and fire extinguishers to damage the building’s façade before attaching themselves to it. Palestine Action targets insurers linked to Elbit Systems UK, an arm of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, to protest alleged complicity in the Middle East conflict. The protest coincided with broader actions by hunger-striking prisoners related to Palestine Action’s activities before a ban on the group. Police reported additional arrests for criminal damage and for displaying material in support of a proscribed organization under anti-terrorism laws. Several hunger strikers reached a dangerous point in health, prompting legal efforts from their counsel to secure a meeting with justice officials.

Founded in 2004 by Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, the network allegedly mirrors the influence patterns of other prominent magnates while maintaining a low public profile. The piece claims Omidyar has invested nearly $2 billion across more than 700 organizations this year, supporting both for-profit ventures and philanthropic entities under the banner of social entrepreneurship and what it characterizes as controlled journalism akin to Wikimedia. According to the article, Omidyar-backed entities participate in destabilization operations, including funding anti-government groups during events like the Arab Spring and the 2013-2014 Ukrainian coup, as well as supporting protest movements in Nigeria and the Philippines.

About 30 seconds after liftoff, an anomaly in the first stage caused the rocket to fall to the ground around 80 seconds after launch, resulting in a large fireball and the destruction of the payload that consisted of five small satellites (Floripasat 2a and 2b, Jussara-K, PionBR 2, and Solaras S2). HANBIT-Nano can place about 90 kg into a 500 km SSO orbit. The vehicle's first stage relies on a hybrid engine using paraffin and LOX, with a second stage capable of using the Hyper (3.5 t) or LiMER (3 t) engines, though the first mission used the hybrid. HANBIT-Nano is derived from the suborbital HANBIT-TLV, which flew successfully in 2023.

Among the documents, there are mentions of US President Donald Trump, including an email noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s. The DOJ emphasized that some materials contain untrue and sensationalist claims about Trump submitted to the FBI just before the 2020 election. The department stressed that these allegations are unfounded and false, though the records are being made public for transparency and victim protection. The release also discusses an FBI intake report from October 27, 2020, describing a claim from a limousine driver about a 1995 conversation involving Trump and Epstein, and a woman who was later reported dead by suicide in 2000. Authorities acknowledge the details are heavily redacted and do not establish credibility.

While GDP growth exceeded expectations, a prominent political figure, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, sparked online backlash by asserting on television that such growth would translate into a 4.3% pay raise for Americans. Critics highlighted a misinterpretation of macroeconomic data, noting that GDP growth does not directly translate to wage increases for all workers, especially in the short term. The piece contextualizes the GDP figure with spending trends—consumption rose, while inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s target—indicating that real incomes may not rise in tandem with nominal GDP growth. Social media users mocked the claim, using terms like “#MAGACantMath,” and experts emphasized the need to distinguish between overall economic growth and individual earnings, which are affected by inflation, productivity, unemployment, and oth]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticism-follows-claim-that-us-gdp-growth-equates-to-a-4-3-pay-raise-for-americans</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticism-follows-claim-that-us-gdp-growth-equates-to-a-4-3-pay-raise-for-americans</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 09:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[US plans to involve private sector in cyber offensives raise security concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that the White House is preparing a national cybersecurity strategy that could involve private sector companies in offensive cyber operations against foreign entities. It notes that currently, no legal basis authorizes independent cyberattacks by private firms, and actions against foreign infrastructure could invite retaliation. Proponents argue that leveraging private resources would augment the government’s ability to counter cybercriminals and state-backed threats, especially in the wake of g d budget cuts and personnel reductions across agencies like CISA. The piece highlights concerns about blurring lines between civil defense and offensive capabilities, potential risks to critical infrastructure, and the need to advance cryptography for a post-quantum era. It also references ongoing tensions with China and other powers, incidents of large-scale cyber campaigns, and the rising role of AI in cyber threats.

Brussels argued that the EU’s digital rules, notably the Digital Services Act (DSA), are essential to safeguarding fundamental rights and market autonomy, and that the bloc will respond decisively to what it calls unjustified U.S. measures. The dispute centers on tensions over digital regulation, with Washington condemning what it sees as Europe’s excessive rules while Brussels emphasizes its sovereign right to regulate its digital market without discrimination. Macron described the move as coercive and vowed to defend European digital sovereignty, noting Breton’s role in shaping the DSA. The article also highlights that the DSA can levy fines up to 6% of a company's worldwide turnover for non-compliance, exemplified by a €120 million penalty on X.

It alleges that Finland allied with Nazi Germany during World War II and conducted harsh occupation policies in Karelia, including concentration-like camps and severe labor. Citing sources such as Otto Kuusinen and a doctoral thesis by Antti Laine, the piece portrays a historiographical shift in Finland that minimizes Finnish complicity and emphasizes a narrative of fighting guerrillas, while downplaying the Nazi influence and the presence of Finnish troops in Karelia. It also highlights ongoing Russian-Finnish historical discourse, including claims about Sandarmokh and debates over figures like Mannerheim and Koivisto. The article connects these historical reinterpretations to contemporary political rhetoric, noting statements by Finnish leaders and a broader anti-communist and anti-Soviet sentiment.

The post claimed that a photo showing Bill Clinton with Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, with some faces redacted, was evidence of victims’ involvement. Journalistic outlets noted that the image in question is a publicly available fundraiser photograph featuring Michael Jackson’s sons and Diana Ross’s son, not Epstein’s victims. This prompted criticism from MeidasTouch Network and others, who argued the post misrepresented the image’s context. The incident came amid broader coverage of the Epstein document release, which followed bipartisan pressure from Congress and included heavy redactions.

The Daily Beast reports that an 11,034-document dump released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act contained numerous redactions, which social media users quickly discovered could be bypassed by copying redacted text into another document and pasting it back, effectively unmasking sensitive information. Prominent online commentators demonstrated the method, with one claiming he recovered hidden text simply by copying and pasting. While some redactions were justified to protect victims or minors, others appeared to reveal names and details previously shielded in the public release. A specific example cited involves a civil case against Epstein estate executors Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, where a redacted line suggested substantial payments to models and actresses, described by Guardian reporting.

The image was fully redacted in the released materials, with both the photo and the sender/recipient names redacted. The article highlights questions about selective redactions and suggests possible special treatment for Trump compared to other figures like Bill Clinton, whose face appeared unredacted in similar disclosures. The broader context involves DOJ disclosures tied to Jeffrey Epstein’s associates and extensive travel records suggesting Trump flew on Epstein’s private jet multiple times, with dates and passenger lists mentioning Maxwell present on several flights.

It notes Paramount's ambitions to expand through a similar purchase, signaling a broader battle among entertainment giants. Despite massive investments in original content by studios, a growing share of audiences in the United States consumes video outside Hollywood channels, with YouTube accounting for a substantial portion of streaming on televisions. This shift shows viewers increasingly watch long-form content on mobile devices, while Hollywood is leaning toward shorter formats on smaller screens.

It claims UK authorities warn of potential Russian attacks and stresses civil preparedness against a range of threats, framing this as part of a broader effort to incite fear. The piece references various sources, including a CBS 60 Minutes segment, die Welt, and a New York Post article, to support its claims about cyberattacks, mercenary networks, and alleged Western cyber offensives. It also discusses alleged Russian attempts to destabilize Europe through sabotage of critical infrastructure, such as water systems, electrical grids, and urban networks, connected to the development of cyber capabilities and intelligent cities.

Prisoners are often offered reduced sentences or even complete pardons in exchange for risking their lives. Both Russia and Ukraine have utilized this strategy, sending prisoners to the front lines. However, the rise of drone warfare has significantly changed the recruitment landscape. With drones, being a soldier no longer requires intense physical training. Even individuals who are out of shape or enthusiasts of video games can become drone operators. These operators can kill from the comfort of a chair without the need for physical exertion. Private military companies are now competing with tech giants like SpaceX, Maxar Technologies, Planet Lab, and Palantir to supply drone technology, satellite images, and real-time data analysis. Western private military firms like Vectus Global and Forward Observation Group have been involved in Ukraine, where drones are deploy]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recruitment-of-prisoners-as-mercenaries-for-technological-warfare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/recruitment-of-prisoners-as-mercenaries-for-technological-warfare</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Controversy Surrounds Canada's 'Victims of Communism' Monument Due to Nazi Links]]></title><description><![CDATA[A year after Canada unveiled its 'Victims of Communism' monument in Ottawa, a government report revealed that many names originally slated to be included had ties to Nazi movements. The monument, conceived in 2007 as a private initiative, originally featured 553 names. However, concerns raised by Jewish groups and independent media suggested that over half of those listed had affiliations with fascist and Nazi groups. The monument, funded by private donations and public funds, has sparked controversy due to these revelations. Some of the donors were organizations with ties to Nazi collaborators, such as the Croatian United Committee of Canada, which honored figures involved in the Nazi-puppet regime of Croatia. The debate also touches on the historical narrative surrounding communism, with the monument's claim of 'over 100 million victims' facing increasing skepticism.

On December 22, 2025, the H3 F8 mission launched from the Tanegashima Space Center, but the second-stage liquid hydrogen engine, LE-5B-3, failed to ignite properly. As a result, the payload, a geostationary satellite named QZS-5, was left in a low orbit and reentered the atmosphere over South America. The mission was originally scheduled for December 17, but it was delayed after a fault in the water injection system at the launch pad. This failure marks the second unsuccessful attempt for the H3 rocket, with the first failure occurring in March 2023 due to a similar engine issue. Despite these setbacks, Japan continues its space ambitions with plans to expand its constellation of geostationary satellites. The failure of this mission highlights ongoing challenges for Japan’s space program, especially as it seeks to compete with other space powers.

According to police in Gelderland province, the incident did not initially appear to be intentional, though an investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause. Authorities identified the driver as a 56-year-old woman from Nunspeet who sustained minor injuries. She was detained as part of the standard protocol for serious traffic accidents. 

The accident occurred as residents had gathered to watch a festive parade of vehicles decorated with Christmas lights. Following the incident, officials in the nearby municipality of Elburg announced that the event had been halted. Nunspeet’s mayor, Jan Nathan Rozendaal, expressed deep sorrow, describing the situation as a moment that was meant to bring “solidarity” turning instead into one of “worry and sadness.”

Led by Major Yevdokiya Bershanskaya and formed under Major Marina Raskova’s initiative, the regiment operated primarily at night, employing a tactic of throttling engines to glide stealthily toward targets. The unit earned the coveted Guards designation in 1943 and carried the honorary title “Taman” for its role in the Novorossiysk–Taman operations.

Russian police opened a criminal investigation into murder by explosives, with investigators inspecting security footage, conducting forensics, and interviewing witnesses to reconstruct movements around the vehicle. Authorities consider multiple leads, including potential involvement by foreign intelligence services. Since the 2022 war in Ukraine, selective killings and sabotage against strategic infrastructure and security figures have risen, though the violence previously fluctuated between spikes and relative calm.

The report, released by the World Bank and China's Ministry of Finance, outlines the drivers of China's poverty alleviation achievements and offers insights for other developing countries. Two primary strategies have driven China’s success: broad-based economic transformation, which raised average incomes and created new opportunities, and targeted support for disadvantaged areas and households. The report emphasizes the importance of education, infrastructure, and competition-friendly policies.

Moms for Liberty, founded in Brevard County, now has a national presence, and many parents voiced their support for less government intervention in vaccine requirements. However, some public health experts have expressed concerns over the potential risks of rolling back vaccination mandates, particularly with outbreaks of diseases like whooping cough and measles.

A significant power outage, affecting around 125,000 homes and businesses, caused traffic lights to fail, which created chaos for Waymo's fleet of driverless cars. Numerous videos surfaced showing Waymos halted at intersections, blocking traffic as human drivers navigated around them. The power outage, caused by rolling blackouts from Pacific Gas & Electric, led to widespread gridlock, and emergency vehicles faced challenges due to the confusion on the streets. In response, Waymo stated that it paused operations to ensure rider safety and allow clear access for emergency responders. The company confirmed the resumption of its services the following Sunday.

It traces periods when Christmas faced suppression, such as in Soviet bloc countries where religion was seen as disloyal to the party, and even in Scotland during the 17th century. It then highlights the modern instances where Christmas is restricted or prohibited, focusing on a small set of countries. North Korea is described as an officially restrictive religious environment where only the leader’s cult is permitted; December 24 is noted as a local holiday in honor of the leader’s grandmother, and December 27 as a constitution-related holiday.

The loan will be used to cover Ukraine's massive economic and military collapse, raising a total of 90 billion euros over the next two years. While the EU initially considered using Russian assets to back the loan, this proposal was rejected in favor of joint debt financing. The repayment will be financed through national budgets and EU contributions, with payments beginning in 2027. Countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic have opted out of the agreement, citing financial concerns. Critics argue that the EU should prioritize domestic spending on healthcare, housing, education, and pensions, rather than continuing to fund the war effort in Ukraine.

A notable shift has been the widespread use of federal agents who operate in masks and without visible identification. These practices undermine transparency and accountability, contributing to a climate of fear within immigrant communities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, often in civilian clothes and unmarked vehicles, have been involved in arrests at sensitive locations like courthouses, schools, and places of worship. The rationale for masking is cited as a means to prevent doxing, yet this blanket policy seems to compromise the agents' accountability and transparency, which are crucial for upholding the rule of law.

The US CLOUD Act of 2018 has created a direct conflict with Europe's stringent privacy laws, particularly the GDPR, as American companies are legally compelled to hand over data to US authorities, even if it’s stored in Europe. This situation forces European organizations to seek alternatives to US cloud providers to maintain control over their data and systems. A few public bodies in Austria, Germany, and France, as well as the International Criminal Court, are taking steps to regain digital autonomy by migrating to European solutions like Nextcloud and OpenDesk.

While this might seem unsettling to many, Raz finds a sense of safety and order under the gang's rule. He explains that the strict enforcement of the gang's power, including harsh punishments for anyone who steps out of line, creates a secure environment where crime is minimal. Although he acknowledges the authoritarian nature of the gang's governance, Raz contrasts it with his experiences in Israel, where he feels democracy has failed to deliver the security and stability he desires. The article explores themes of governance, security, and the perceived failure of democratic systems in the face of societal instability.

Beginning with the early 20th century, the piece details the role of U.S. corporations, such as Standard Oil, in Venezuela's oil sector. The Venezuelan nationalization of its oil industry in the 1970s marked a turning point, but the U.S. continued to exert influence. The rise of Hugo Chávez in the late 1990s and his policies of resource sovereignty sparked heightened U.S. opposition, including covert support for a 2002 coup attempt.

Belgium’s Prime Minister Bart De Wever has become a central figure in opposing this proposal, arguing that confiscating the assets would violate international law, undermine financial stability, and set a dangerous precedent. Most of these Russian reserves are held by Euroclear, a major Brussels-based financial institution. Legal experts, including Robert Volterra, have warned that such a move would be illegal and could trigger lawsuits that might bankrupt Euroclear and destabilize Belgium’s economy. 

De Wever’s stance sparked strong backlash from EU officials and pro-EU media, accusing him of siding with Moscow. Yet, other countries — including Hungary, Slovakia, Italy, Bulgaria, and Malta — have joined Belgium’s opposition, fearing that confiscation could erode trust in the euro and cause capital flight.

Thousands have been displaced from border regions, while hundreds of thousands of reservists were pulled from the workforce, disrupting key sectors. Despite these struggles, some aspects of the economy, like the stock market and the shekel, have shown resilience, though they mask deeper issues. Economist Shir Hever describes Israel's economy as a 'zombie economy,' functioning but with no clear future due to heavy reliance on military expenditure, foreign loans, and denial of the situation. The nation faces significant debt, weakening international trade relations, and boycotts.

While the idea of an ocean rich in ammonia and other compounds has been supported by Cassini's data, a new study challenges this notion by analyzing Titan's response to tidal forces. The original hypothesis suggested a liquid ocean nearly 250 km thick, but new research indicates that instead of a global ocean, Titan might have multiple layers of different types of ice, with potential liquid water pockets. Titan's unique environment, including its methane lakes and thick atmosphere, makes it a fascinating target for NASA's Dragonfly mission, launching in 2028.

As of early 2025, the population of the city is a fraction of the expected number, with only around 10,000 people living in the area. Despite over $30 billion invested, the island city remains almost deserted, with many buildings and shops empty.

The article notes that Israel’s defense industry has broadened its client base from Southeast Asia to North Africa, with Morocco validating a new order for heavy artillery within the year. It mentions deployments of Israeli-made equipment in other regional conflicts, illustrating that international criticism of the Gaza war has not disrupted Israeli arms exports. Leading defense companies such as Elbit Systems and Rafael are highlighted as key players in this growth. Morocco reportedly made a significant investment, signing an agreement estimated at 150 to 200 million euros for ATMOS artillery systems, supplementing existing acquisitions like the PULS rocket launcher and the Barak MX air defense shield.

In a recent blog post, the author reflects on the critical themes of the documentary and shares a poignant excerpt that highlights the dangers of the privatization of healthcare. The excerpt features a doctor who passionately discusses how the current trend of privatizing healthcare is leading to preventable deaths. As public healthcare systems collapse under the pressure of underfunding, more and more individuals are unable to access essential care. The doctor warns that this isn't an accidental outcome, but a deliberate policy shift that prioritizes private profits over human lives. Long waitlists, overcrowded primary care, and understaffed emergency services are just some of the deadly consequences of this shift. The post emphasizes that those who promote the dismantling of public healthcare systems are not just poor managers—they are complicit in a system that is ki]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impact of Satellite Megaconstellations on Space-Based Observatories]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent years, the deployment of massive satellite constellations such as Starlink has raised concerns about their impact on astronomical observations, including those conducted from space. Initially, some suggested that moving telescopes to low Earth orbit (LEO) could solve the issue. However, a recent study published in Nature by Alejandro Borlaff, Pamela Marcum, and Steve Howell confirms that even space-based telescopes in LEO are increasingly affected. Currently, about 9,400 Starlink satellites orbit Earth, but projections suggest that by 2040 there could be up to 500,000 satellites, causing significant contamination of astronomical images. Already, 4.3% of Hubble Space Telescope images between 2018 and 2021 were affected. Newer satellites, such as Starlink v2 Mini, are larger and brighter, exacerbating the problem. Future wide-field and all-sky survey missions like NASA's SPHEREx, the Chinese Xuntian telescope, and the European ARRAKIHS could see up to 96% of their observations ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canada’s Controversial ‘Victims of Communism’ Monument Will Remove All Names]]></title><description><![CDATA[A year after its opening, Canada's Monument to the Victims of Communism in Ottawa is facing a major controversy over the names initially set to be inscribed on the memorial. A government report revealed that more than half of the 553 names planned for inclusion were linked to Nazi or fascist affiliations. As a result, the Department of Canadian Heritage has decided to remove all individual names and instead focus on thematic content that aligns with Canadian values of democracy and human rights. The monument, designed by architect Paul Raff, originally sought to commemorate the suffering of millions under communist regimes. However, its funding and connections to controversial groups, including Nazi collaborators, have sparked criticism. This shift in focus follows widespread backlash from Jewish organizations and media outlets who raised concerns about the individuals initially listed on the memorial.

Staff recounted that the guest was rarely seen outside the room, and several workers did not know what he looked like due to his limited movements. Upon checkout, staff discovered an enormous mess: a three-foot-deep mountain of toilet paper, food wrappers, bottles, and takeaway containers cluttered every surface. The bathroom was severely littered, with tissues and discarded items covering the sink, and a thick brown grime covering the floor. A table and two gaming chairs were buried under waste. Cleaning required three days of back-breaking work to disinfect and restore the room. Despite the severity, management indicated no police report and no immediate plans to pursue responsibility, noting the guest still owed fees totaling nearly £300.

The decision comes amid a broader defense spending spree, as the German Bundestag recently authorized over 50 billion euros for various military projects, including combat vehicles, artillery systems, and space-based assets. The MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, manufactured by General Atomics, will be used for long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions, supporting the German Navy's existing fleet of P-8A Poseidon aircraft. This acquisition effectively ends Germany’s involvement in the EuroDrone program, a European initiative led by Airbus for developing a medium-altitude long-endurance drone. Germany’s decision is seen as a blow to the European defense industry, especially given its historical leadership in the EuroDrone project and its use of Israeli-made drones in the past.

The author, Martin Sonneborn, argues that these sanctions highlight the EU's increasing authoritarianism and disregard for the rule of law. Baud, who has written extensively on the Ukraine conflict, has been banned from entering EU territory and had his assets frozen despite having no financial ties to Russia. Sonneborn compares the EU's actions to a dictatorship, noting the lack of transparency, the inability for the accused to defend themselves, and the absence of legal processes. He also points out that similar repressive actions are being taken against others who dissent from the mainstream EU narrative on Ukraine and Gaza.

It frames the Palestinian struggle as emblematic of a broader anti-colonial and anti-elite resistance, suggesting that slogans like 'globalize the intifada' echo historical calls for people’s power against oppressive systems. The piece links modern surveillance tech, facial recognition, and militarized policing to a broader trend of control over everyday life, positing that these tools have been developed and tested in the occupied Palestinian territories. It further contends that Israel serves as a model for how elites might manage surplus populations in a resource-scarce, climate-threatened world, with dissent framed as antisemitic when directed at this dominant narrative.

El grupo atribuye la medida a la necesidad de mantener la innovación y evitar la fuga de talento hacia competidores, especialmente ante la presión de un mercado saturado donde los márgenes son estrechos y algunas compañías ya han cerrado.

A lo largo de su reflexión, la periodista sitúa el tema en un contexto más amplio: la Navidad como periodo de celebración, ayuda a los necesitados y reflexión comunitaria. Señala que el cristianismo, y otros enfoques, deben coexistir sin que la lingüística de las festividades llegue a convertirse en una barrera para la inclusión.

El autor sostiene que este fenómeno no puede explicarse únicamente por la influencia de las redes sociales o por una supuesta frivolidad juvenil, sino por el fracaso de la democracia en dar respuesta a los principales problemas que afectan a las nuevas generaciones.

Sevilla argumenta que la política democrática ha perdido prestigio debido a la polarización extrema, la corrupción, el enfrentamiento permanente y la incapacidad de diálogo entre los partidos, lo que ha erosionado la confianza de los jóvenes en las instituciones. A ello se suma la falta de soluciones efectivas a problemas estructurales como el desempleo juvenil, la precariedad laboral y, especialmente, el acceso a la vivienda.

Según el auto de 5 de diciembre de 2025, la Sala sostuvo que el nombramiento de Cristina Álvarez, amiga íntima de Begoña Gómez, como asistente de la esposa del presidente del Gobierno podía ser el 'primer indicio' de un posible delito de malversación, argumentando que nunca antes se había nombrado a alguien sin formación en protocolo. Sin embargo, investigaciones posteriores demostraron que todos los asistentes de esposas de presidentes anteriores también eran personas de confianza y no necesariamente expertos en protocolo. Además, se descubrió que el juez instructor Juan Carlos Peinado tergiversó la declaración de la testigo Sonsoles Blanca Gil de Antuñano para imputar a Juan José Güemes, ejecutivo del Instituto de Empresa, bajo amenaza de falso testimonio, generando una imputación basada en información incorrecta que más tarde fue archivada por la Aud]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/errores-procesales-y-falsedades-en-la-instruccion-del-caso-begona-gomez</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/errores-procesales-y-falsedades-en-la-instruccion-del-caso-begona-gomez</guid><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 07:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Opciones para los asegurados privados ante el aumento de sus cuotas de 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 2026, los seguros de salud privados en Alemania experimentarán un aumento significativo de las cuotas, afectando a aproximadamente el 60% de los asegurados, con un incremento medio del 13%. Esta situación está generando preocupación entre muchas personas, especialmente ex autónomos con pensiones bajas. La Verbraucherzentrale NRW ofrece orientación sobre cómo afrontar estos incrementos. Entre las opciones disponibles se encuentra el cambio de tarifa dentro de la misma aseguradora, aunque con la advertencia de que ciertos beneficios pueden perderse permanentemente. Otra alternativa es renunciar a algunos servicios, como la habitación individual en hospitales o la atención de un médico especialista, o cambiar a tarifas con médico primario, donde se requiere acudir primero a un médico general. Incrementar el propio deducible es otra posibilidad para reducir la cuota mensual, aunque hay que considerar que esta medida no suele ser reversible sin una nueva evaluación de salud.

A pesar de ello, el envío fue liberado en el mercado español. El cadmio es un metal pesado muy tóxico, que puede acumularse en los riñones y afectar la salud ósea si se ingiere de manera prolongada. También puede causar irritación gastrointestinal aguda, vómitos y diarrea en casos de exposición elevada. La EFSA establece una ingesta semanal tolerable de 2,5 μg/kg de peso corporal.

El crecimiento se apoya en varios pilares fundamentales.

Estas alzas afectan tanto a seguros individuales como colectivos y se deben a diversos factores, entre los que destacan el aumento de los costes sanitarios, la presión en precios de los proveedores y la mayor utilización de los seguros desde la pandemia. Las aseguradoras perciben que los clientes mantienen fidelidad a pesar de las subidas, debido a la sensación de deterioro de la sanidad pública y las largas listas de espera. Según Rastreator, la variabilidad de precios puede alcanzar hasta el 72%, con seguros básicos a partir de 46 euros y completos hasta 74 euros.

La citación original estaba prevista para el 9 de enero, fecha en la que su agenda oficial aún permanece vacía, lo que ha generado críticas de la Asociación de Víctimas Mortales dana 29O. Esta entidad representa a 160 familiares de 90 fallecidos en la catástrofe que provocó 230 muertes. La portavoz de la asociación, Rosa Álvarez, ha criticado que Feijóo remitiera su escrito pocas horas antes de Nochebuena, considerando que se trataba de un gesto insensible hacia los familiares. La petición de Feijóo se ampara en la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal, que permite a diputados y senadores declarar desde su despacho o la sede del órgano del que forman parte.

El cura de la localidad publicó en Wallapop un anuncio para vender las puertas de la iglesia, incluyendo una puerta barroca del siglo XVI, a un precio de 390 euros. Este templo es relevante históricamente porque se cree que alberga la tumba del renombrado escultor Alonso Berruguete, cuyos restos se intentaron localizar años atrás mediante georradar. La noticia fue alertada por la vecina Malena Alonso, quien informó a la alcaldesa María Luisa Escalante. Según fuentes oficiales, la venta se realizó a través de un amigo del cura, y las puertas finalmente no se vendieron. Wallapop retiró el anuncio, siguiendo su política de prohibir la venta de bienes pertenecientes a instituciones públicas o religiosas.

Según Mossawa, un centro de derechos de los ciudadanos palestinos en Israel, la detención se llevó a cabo con el uso de fuerza excesiva, afectando también a un DJ y a un vendedor ambulante. Todos fueron puestos en libertad al día siguiente, pero podrían ser citados de nuevo ante los tribunales. La intervención policial incluyó la dispersión de las actividades festivas, el decomiso de equipo y la entrada en una academia de música sin autorización. Testigos y la propia Mossawa describen videos que muestran a oficiales arrastrando al disfraz de Santa Claus, interrumpiendo un dabke callejero y agrediendo a asistentes, mientras que la policía señaló que se trató de un incidente de “ruido inusual y alteración del orden público”.

La norma, conocida como 'Energy Consumption Limits for Electric Vehicles', establece límites de consumo basados en el peso en vacío y las características del vehículo, endureciendo los requisitos de eficiencia en un 11% respecto a los estándares anteriores no obligatorios. Se estima que, tras las mejoras técnicas necesarias, la autonomía de los vehículos aumentará un 7% con baterías de la misma capacidad. La regulación no afecta a los híbridos enchufables ni a los eléctricos de autonomía extendida, aunque sí se elevará la autonomía mínima requerida para acceder a incentivos fiscales. Muchos modelos actuales ya cumplen los nuevos requisitos, por lo que no necesitarán modificaciones.

La pareja le brindó cuidados básicos, apoyo emocional y ayudó a Ronnie a integrarse en la sociedad, consiguiéndole un empleo como recolector de basura y facilitándole ropa y educación social. Ronnie desarrolló diversas rutinas diarias y colaboró activamente en la iglesia local, mostrando siempre su generosidad y dedicación a los demás, a pesar de luchar con adicciones y ciertas dificultades sociales. La relación entre ellos se consolidó como una familia no convencional, donde Ronnie asumió distintos roles según las necesidades de la pareja y sus hijos, quienes crecieron viéndolo como un miembro más del hogar.

Más Madrid argumenta que estas prácticas podrían haber afectado a la calidad asistencial y denuncia instrucciones para no aplicar ciertos procedimientos clínicos a pacientes “no cápita” y la reutilización de material desechable, lo que pone en riesgo la seguridad.

Ferran Adrià, reconocido chef español, cuestionó esta afirmación señalando que en España solo un pequeño porcentaje de la población alcanza salarios elevados.

Adrià subrayó que la aspiración de la mayoría no debería centrarse en marcas exclusivas, sino en expectativas más realistas según la situación económica de cada uno.

El título original, 'Siente un pobre a su mesa', fue prohibido por su carácter crítico con la moral y la tradición católica. Incluso la segunda propuesta, 'Los Bienaventurados', fue rechazada por considerarla excesivamente evangélica. Finalmente, la película se estrenó con el nombre 'Plácido', aunque los censores llegaron a recomendar su prohibición total. La documentación recopilada por la Associació Memòria i Història de Manresa, disponible en memoria.cat, incluye más de setenta comunicaciones que muestran cómo la Junta de Clasificación y Censura recortó escenas y emitió informes sobre el contenido, criticando su humor negro, el ataque a la religión y la representación de la sociedad.

Todas ellas compartían un mismo administrador, Manuel Alba Fernández, y estaban domiciliadas en la misma dirección. Cada empresa solicitaba 15 licencias, siguiendo un patrón ya conocido en el sector de transporte, que busca rodear la normativa mediante sociedades instrumentales y aparentes independencias. El Juzgado de lo Contencioso-Administrativo número 31 respaldó al Ayuntamiento de Madrid, afirmando que las empresas no habían seguido el procedimiento legal correcto y que el taxi es un servicio público, no un mercado libre sin reglas. Aunque la sentencia aún puede ser recurrida, marca un precedente importante para limitar la concentración de licencias y proteger el equilibrio del sector. Este caso pone de relieve la tensión entre la protección del servicio público y los intereses empresariales, subrayando la necesidad de reglas claras]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trece-empresas-en-madrid-intentan-concentrar-licencias-de-taxi-y-la-justicia-lo-frena</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Colosal error de Óscar Puente frente a Mariló Montero: 4 bulos en 1 minuto, récord mundial.

Según un informe de Zonaprop, el incremento promedio fue del 19,46%, mientras que la subida interanual alcanza el 35,08%. Actualmente, el precio mensual promedio de un departamento de dos ambientes es de 850 dólares. El 42% de los anuncios de alquiler se publica en dólares, mientras que el resto se ofrece en pesos argentinos. Tras la derogación de la Ley de Alquileres en diciembre de 2023, la proporción de avisos en dólares había disminuido, aunque desde agosto de 2025 se observa un repunte. En cuanto a los barrios más costosos, Puerto Madero lidera la lista con 1.312 dólares mensuales, seguido de Colegiales (1.160 dólares) y Monserrat (1.057 dólares).

La investigación judicial comenzó a tomar forma en 2020, aunque los hechos más controvertidos ocurrieron entre 2008 y 2014, periodo protegido por la inviolabilidad de la corona y, además, por la prescripción de posibles delitos. Fondos millonarios procedentes de Arabia Saudí y Bahréin fueron gestionados mediante fundaciones y cuentas en Suiza y Panamá, llegando incluso a transferencias a personas cercanas al monarca. La Fiscalía y Hacienda reconocieron que los pagos realizados posteriormente por Juan Carlos a la Agencia Tributaria, sumando varios millones de euros, impidieron acusaciones por fraude fiscal.

Sin embargo, este buen desempeño macroeconómico no se refleja en la vida cotidiana de los ciudadanos.

El salario mínimo interprofesional ha subido a 1.184 euros mensuales, pero incluso esta cifra resulta insuficiente en las grandes ciudades. La vivienda es uno de los principales factores de presión económica, con alquileres que superan los 14 euros por metro cuadrado y subidas de precios que pueden absorber gran parte del salario.

Aunque Merz prometió mejorar la economía y fortalecer la posición internacional de Alemania, su gestión ha sido percibida como insuficiente. Internamente, enfrenta desafíos por el descontento de miembros de su propio partido, y ministros como Boris Pistorius y Johann Wadephul gozan de mayor aprobación que el propio canciller.

Durante la misa y la tradicional bendición 'Urbi et Orbi', el pontífice hizo un llamamiento a la responsabilidad individual y colectiva para promover la paz y la justicia. Destacó la fragilidad de los niños, los jóvenes obligados a la guerra y las personas que sufren hambre, pobreza o explotación laboral. Además, pidió por la estabilidad y la reconciliación en zonas de conflicto como Líbano, Palestina, Israel, Siria, Ucrania, Sudán, Malí, Burkina Faso, República Democrática del Congo, Haití, Myanmar, Tailandia y Camboya, así como por las víctimas de desastres naturales en Asia y Oceanía.

Este vídeo fue compartido en las redes sociales del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) estadounidense, como parte de una campaña que muchos consideran provocativa e insensible. En paralelo, la administración ha implementado nuevas medidas legales que buscan anular miles de solicitudes de asilo, en un contexto de críticas sobre la retórica y las políticas migratorias adoptadas. La publicación del vídeo ha generado indignación tanto dentro como fuera de Estados Unidos, resaltando la controversia sobre el uso de herramientas digitales para comunicar mensajes políticos y la creciente normalización de contenidos que trivializan situaciones humanas graves.

Según datos de ACEA que abarcan la Unión Europea, Reino Unido y los países de la Asociación Europea de Libre Comercio, se matricularon 253.768 turismos eléctricos, lo que representa un aumento del 37,3% respecto al mismo mes del año anterior. Los vehículos 100% eléctricos (BEV) alcanzaron una cuota del 23,5%, mientras que los híbridos y mild hybrid (HEV y MHEV) lograron un 33,4%. Los modelos de gasolina bajaron al 23,1% y los híbridos enchufables (PHEV) consiguieron un 10,4%. Esto refleja que un 33,9% de los compradores europeos eligieron coches enchufables, superando a los híbridos convencionales. El diésel se sitúa en el 6,9% y otras tecnologías en el 2,7%.

Los hechos se remontan a comportamientos inapropiados detectados meses antes de que se interpusiera una denuncia formal en mayo de 2025, cuando una profesora alertó de la gravedad de la situación. A pesar de que varios docentes ya habían advertido internamente sobre la conducta del trabajador del comedor, el colegio mantuvo al presunto agresor en su puesto durante todo un curso escolar.

Las familias, cuyos hijos tenían entre tres y seis años, aseguran que la dirección del centro actuó con silencio, minimización de los hechos y peticiones de discreción, lo que a su juicio buscaba evitar un escándalo público y proteger la reputación del colegio, vinculado al Opus Dei.

Aunque su acción era ilegal según la ley DORA, Jebb buscaba visibilizar el sufrimiento de los niños y usar su detención para amplificar su mensaje humanitario. Nacida en 1876 en una familia acomodada, estudió historia en Oxford y, tras la muerte de su hermano, dedicó su vida a ayudar a los más necesitados. Su trabajo en los Balcanes y con la Charity Organisation Society le permitió constatar que la pobreza se debía más a la injusticia que a la desgracia. Tras la guerra, ella y su hermana Dorothy documentaron la hambruna en Europa y fundaron el Consejo de Lucha contra la Hambruna.

Inicialmente se trasladó a Estados Unidos gracias al Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS) aprobado para venezolanos, lo que le permitió trabajar y formalizar su negocio editorial. Sin embargo, sus intentos de obtener una visa de talento extraordinario en EE.UU. fracasaron pese a contar con un expediente exhaustivo.

Estos ataques se justifican por acusaciones a Hamás de no respetar el alto el fuego vigente. La ofensiva ha afectado especialmente al sur de Ciudad de Gaza y al este de Jan Yunis, coincidiendo con la primera Navidad tras dos años de conflicto en la zona. Además, Israel ha bombardeado distintos puntos de la frontera con el Líbano, donde han fallecido dos personas, entre ellas un miembro de la unidad de élite de la Guardia Revolucionaria de Irán. Según el Ejército israelí, los objetivos eran considerados terroristas, específicamente Husein Mahmud Marshad al Juhari, vinculado a la Unidad 840 de la Fuerza Quds, implicada en ataques planificados contra Israel desde Siria y Líbano.

La pieza escultórica ofrece una ventana a las prácticas culturales romanas relacionadas con el teatro, la pantomima y la expresión cómica, destacando cómo los romanos podían integrar lo grotesco y lo humorístico en su arte y en su percepción del cuerpo humano.

Estudios muestran que un adulto revisa el teléfono entre 80 y 150 veces al día, generando una sensación constante de urgencia que afecta la comunicación cara a cara. La exposición de los menores a los dispositivos está condicionada por el comportamiento de los adultos: si durante la comida o el ocio familiar todos miran el móvil, los niños perciben que el dispositivo es más importante que las personas. Además, el uso excesivo del móvil se asocia con ansiedad, insomnio y otros problemas de salud.

La medida se enmarca dentro de un esfuerzo más amplio por proteger la seguridad nacional y reducir la dependencia de tecnología extranjera considerada de riesgo. Esta regulación, respaldada por la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC), impide que nuevos modelos de drones y componentes críticos obtenidos fuera de EE.UU. reciban la aprobación para su comercialización. Sin embargo, los drones ya adquiridos por consumidores y empresas seguirán siendo legales, por lo que la prohibición solo afecta a modelos más recientes.

Publicado en Cell Reports Medicine, el estudio demuestra que restaurar el equilibrio del NAD+, una molécula central para la energía celular, puede prevenir e incluso revertir el Alzheimer en ratones con la enfermedad avanzada. Los investigadores utilizaron modelos animales que replican mutaciones humanas en proteínas asociadas al Alzheimer, como la beta-amiloide y la tau, y encontraron que la recuperación del NAD+ permitió corregir patologías cerebrales y restaurar la función cognitiva. Además, los niveles de tau fosforilada 217, un biomarcador clínico de la enfermedad, también se normalizaron, confirmando la reversión de la enfermedad. El estudio advierte que los precursores de NAD+ disponibles sin receta pueden ser peligrosos, mientras que el fármaco experimental P7C3-A20 usado en el estud]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restaurar-el-equilibrio-energetico-cerebral-podria-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-modelos-animales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restaurar-el-equilibrio-energetico-cerebral-podria-revertir-el-alzheimer-en-modelos-animales</guid><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 00:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cuerno Verde y la batalla que marcó la frontera norte de Nueva España]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante la segunda mitad del siglo XVIII, los comanches dominaron las Grandes Llanuras de Norteamérica, estableciendo un territorio conocido como Comanchería gracias a su habilidad con los caballos, la diplomacia y el comercio del bisonte. El gran jefe Cuerno Verde, cuyo nombre indígena era Tabivo Naritgant, heredó el liderazgo de su padre y se convirtió en un formidable enemigo de los asentamientos españoles en Nuevo México. Sus incursiones y ataques constantes llevaron a Madrid a organizar una expedición dirigida por Juan Bautista de Anza, gobernador de Nuevo México desde 1777. Anza, experimentado en tácticas de caballería ligera, ideó un plan de emboscada que permitió acorralar a Cuerno Verde y sus hombres en las faldas de la actual Greenhorn Mountain en Colorado el 3 de septiembre de 1779, donde murieron junto a su hijo y otros jefes comanches. El penacho verde de Cuerno Verde fue tomado como trofeo y enviado al rey Carlos III y posteriormente al Papa Pío VI.

La cuarta baliza es de producción española por Ditraimon S.L., vendida bajo la marca Call SOS. La retirada de la homologación implica que estos modelos ya no figuran en la lista oficial de balizas certificadas, aunque los usuarios que las hayan comprado podrán seguir utilizándolas durante su vida útil, estimada en hasta 12 años, hasta que expire el periodo de conectividad incluido.

En 2025, se conmemoraban 50 años de la primera intervención televisada de un monarca tras la muerte de Franco y 40 años de la entrada de España en la Unión Europea. El rey centró su mensaje en conceptos abstractos como 'Europa', 'convivencia' y 'confianza', evitando abordar directamente los problemas políticos actuales, la polarización social y el auge del fascismo. Según el autor, Gerardo Tecé, el discurso fue breve y simbólico, más enfocado en la puesta en escena que en contenido concreto, adoptando una estrategia de equidistancia que pretende no posicionarse ni a favor ni en contra de distintos sectores de la sociedad. Tecé critica que la monarquía use esta estrategia para evadir responsabilidades en la crisis democrática y social del país, comparando irónicamente al rey con un 'Mortadelo' inten]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-critico-del-discurso-de-navidad-de-felipe-vi-en-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-critico-del-discurso-de-navidad-de-felipe-vi-en-2025</guid><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tribunal absuelve a un hombre de estafa por negligencia del denunciante]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Canarias (TSJC) ha absuelto a un hombre previamente condenado a cuatro años de prisión por estafa en la venta de viviendas, tras considerar que la víctima actuó con desidia y negligencia al entregar sucesivamente importantes sumas de dinero sin recibir ninguna propiedad a cambio. La sentencia destaca que las estafas fueron burdas y reiteradas, sumando un total de 246.000 euros en seis operaciones durante año y medio. El acusado se hizo pasar por un agente inmobiliario con experiencia y ofreció viviendas a precios muy bajos de fondos buitres, recibiendo transferencias y cheques por montos significativos. Aunque en ningún caso se formalizó la compra, tras la amenaza de acciones judiciales devolvió 100.000 euros, lo que permitió aplicar la atenuante de reparación del daño.

Fulnecky denunció que la nota se debía a sus creencias religiosas y a su ejercicio de la libertad de expresión, ya que en el ensayo citaba repetidamente la Biblia y defendía que la existencia de múltiples identidades de género se alejaba del “plan original de Dios”.

Usando equipos más antiguos de litografía ultravioleta profunda (UVP), adquiridos antes del veto, han conseguido fabricar procesadores de 7 nanómetros —e incluso de 5 nm— empleando una técnica conocida como 'multi-patterning'. Este método consiste en realizar múltiples pasadas sobre la misma oblea de silicio para alcanzar una mayor densidad de los circuitos, algo que normalmente solo sería posible con maquinaria UVE de última generación. 

El avance, que ha permitido la producción del Kirin 9000S y el reciente Kirin 9030, demuestra el ingenio técnico de SMIC pese a las limitaciones de hardware.

Mientras muchos compañeros abandonaban la compañía, él optó por quedarse, formarse y adaptarse a los cambios con el objetivo de seguir siendo útil y competitivo.

El despido se produjo de manera inesperada, dentro de un recorte de plantilla que afectó a unas 200 personas en varios países europeos. Favre sospecha que la causa principal fue su coste salarial, ya que con los años había mejorado sus condiciones, y también la deslocalización de funciones hacia países con mano de obra más barata.

Rubio destaca que la adicción al alcohol es una enfermedad crónica con predisposición a recaídas, y que la vulnerabilidad persiste incluso tras la abstinencia. Se enfatiza que la diferencia de género existe: las mujeres pueden sufrir daños neurológicos con menores consumos por la mayor sensibilidad de sus neuronas a tóxicos. El artículo concluye que el tratamiento efectivo requiere un enfoque integral que combine desintoxicación, terapia cognitivo-conductual y, crucialmente, apoyo comunitario y grupos de ayuda mutua.

La medida busca evitar un aumento brusco de costes y una espiral inflacionaria mientras el país desarrolla su propia capacidad de producción mediante la Ley de Chips. Aunque se mantiene la postura firme frente a China en la guerra tecnológica, la suspensión refleja la imposibilidad de un desacople total a corto plazo sin dañar la economía estadounidense. Los fabricantes habían advertido de incrementos de costes de hasta un 25% en sectores críticos, lo que podría repercutir directamente en los precios al consumidor. China, por su parte, sigue teniendo influencia sobre materiales estratégicos como tierras raras y minerales críticos, lo que refuerza la interdependencia.

Estas iniciativas han generado preocupación en la comunidad científica debido a los riesgos éticos y biológicos que implican, como la posibilidad de introducir errores genéticos y efectos no deseados en la línea germinal. Los expertos advierten que, aunque los proyectos se presentan como soluciones médicas, podrían abrir la puerta a la creación de 'bebés de diseño' y a un tipo de eugenesia moderna. Investigadores como Lluis Montoliu y Gemma Marfany destacan que existen métodos más seguros, como el diagnóstico genético preimplantacional, que permiten seleccionar embriones sin mutaciones patógenas sin necesidad de editar su ADN.

La licitación fue publicada en plena semana de Navidad y afecta a una superficie de 3.042 metros cuadrados, valorada en más de 2,3 millones de euros. Este intento sucede tras la anulación de un concurso anterior debido a las deudas del Arzobispado con el Ayuntamiento. Aunque la convocatoria está abierta a otras confesiones religiosas, todo apunta a que la única oferta provendrá de la Iglesia. El proyecto original, conocido como 'minivaticano', incluía un gran templo, oficinas, auditorio y otros servicios, pero fue cuestionado por su posible aprovechamiento económico indebido.

La política se ha convertido en espectáculo y los líderes visibles actúan como pararrayos de indignación colectiva, absorbendo críticas y polémicas que desvían la atención de los asuntos estructurales que realmente importan. La incompetencia aparente de estos líderes es funcional: permite al sistema financiero y corporativo consolidar su poder sin interferencias.

Sin embargo, la controversia surgió por las declaraciones del secretario de Comercio, Howard Lutnick, quien aseguró que este crecimiento significaba automáticamente un aumento salarial del 4,3 % para todos los estadounidenses. Estas afirmaciones provocaron burlas y críticas en redes sociales y entre economistas, que señalaron que el crecimiento del PIB no se traduce directamente en un incremento uniforme de los ingresos personales. El informe del Departamento de Comercio también indicó que el gasto de los consumidores subió un 3,5 %, mientras que la inflación sigue siendo una preocupación, con índices superiores al objetivo del 2 % de la Reserva Federal.

Su posición, dentro de una pequeña esfera giratoria de apenas tres pies de diámetro, los exponía a ataques enemigos, al frío extremo de gran altitud y a riesgos mecánicos, incluyendo el aterrizaje. La torreta ofrecía poca protección y su diseño limitado dificultaba cualquier intento de escape rápido, especialmente en emergencia. Los artilleros debían permanecer en posición fetal, operando las ametralladoras Browning AN/M2 de calibre .50 desde un espacio extremadamente reducido, lo que requería tanto fuerza física como una gran concentración.

Estas palabras, lejos de tranquilizar al sector, provocaron un fuerte impacto en los mercados y un profundo malestar entre productores que, en su mayoría, habían apoyado políticamente al presidente.

El caso de Gary Vetter, ganadero de Iowa con más de cinco décadas de experiencia, refleja el sentir generalizado.

Esta medida, resultado de negociaciones directas entre el enviado especial John Cole y el régimen de Aliaksandr Lukashenka, ha permitido la liberación de 123 presos políticos, incluyendo al Nobel de la Paz Ales Bialiatski. Sin embargo, más allá del aspecto humanitario, el movimiento afecta al mercado agrícola europeo, ya que la potasa es un insumo clave para fertilizantes y la seguridad alimentaria.

En dichos mensajes, Mazón describía la gravedad de la situación y las dificultades que enfrentaba la administración autonómica para gestionar la catástrofe, incluyendo la falta de acceso a algunos pueblos y la coordinación con el Gobierno central. Feijóo ha remitido al Juzgado de Instrucción de Catarroja los mensajes recibidos de Mazón, acompañados de un acta notarial que acredita su autenticidad y un documento explicativo del contexto de las conversaciones. El líder del PP ha solicitado además que su comparecencia como testigo prevista para el 9 de enero se realice de forma telemática.

La iniciativa fue anunciada por Galen Hunt, ingeniero veterano de la compañía, quien busca contratar a un ingeniero especializado en Rust para liderar este proceso. La estrategia combina análisis de código a gran escala para mapear dependencias y estructuras complejas con agentes de inteligencia artificial capaces de ayudar a traducir y reescribir código de forma automatizada. Rust ha sido elegido por su capacidad de ofrecer un rendimiento cercano al de C/C++ pero con seguridad de memoria y concurrencia integradas, reduciendo riesgos asociados a vulnerabilidades históricas.

Entre estos hallazgos destaca una fotografía encontrada en el teléfono de Steve Bannon que muestra a Trump junto a Maxwell, la cual fue redactada en su totalidad en los documentos oficiales. Además, se revelan correos electrónicos que indican que Trump viajó en el jet privado de Epstein más veces de lo que había declarado públicamente, en algunos vuelos acompañado de Maxwell y familiares suyos. Otro documento polémico es una supuesta carta de Epstein a Larry Nassar, mencionando a Trump, aunque el FBI declaró posteriormente que dicha carta era falsa.

Pla se describe como alguien que crea “cosas” y considera la interpretación como un trabajo más, mientras señala que provocar es más una consecuencia que una intención. A punto de estrenarse la película Emergency Exit, de Lluís Miñarro, Pla interpreta a un director de cine extremadamente complejo, y su visión sobre el arte es contundente: “un trabajo como cualquier otro” y “no me transformo en nada, solo sigo indicaciones”. El actor también aborda su presencia en Hamlet, a partir del 23 de diciembre en Barcelona, y su percepción de la moda del camuflaje artístico frente a la reacción del público.

Además, subraya el tono lacrimógeno del relato y cuestiona la veracidad de afirmaciones sobre Franco y la Transición, señalando que Juan Carlos exagera su papel y minimiza la oposición del dictador a la democratización de España.

A pesar de este ingreso, Torrejón Salud presentó en agosto un recurso de reposición solicitando una compensación adicional, argumentando que persisten los desequilibrios económicos que han generado pérdidas acumuladas de 69,5 millones hasta 2024.

Según datos de la Comisión Europea, la edad media de los agricultores en la UE es de 57 años y solo el 12 % tiene menos de 40 años, lo que pone en riesgo la continuidad del sector primario. En este contexto, Samanta, una joven agricultora de Níjar (Almería), ha dado visibilidad a esta problemática a través de un vídeo en TikTok que ha tenido una amplia repercusión.

En su intervención, Samanta rechaza la idea de que los jóvenes no quieran dedicarse al campo y subraya que el verdadero problema es la imposibilidad económica de hacerlo. Explica que acceder a la agricultura hoy en día requiere una inversión inicial muy elevada y que el sistema actual de financiación y ayudas no facilita la incorporación de nuevos profesionales.

La jueza Luisa María Prieto Ramírez argumenta que el Código Penal no contempla la figura de desórdenes públicos y desobediencia en su modalidad “imprudente”, requisito necesario para imputar responsabilidad penal al delegado. Para que existiera delito, sería necesario que el acusado hubiera actuado con dolo, es decir, con intención de causar daño a los agentes, algo que no se demuestra en la querella.

Esta división tiene implicaciones directas sobre el acceso al aborto: mientras que en Tennessee es ilegal tras el fallo de la Corte Suprema de 2022, en Virginia sigue siendo legal. La única clínica de abortos de la ciudad, la Clínica de Salud Femenina de Bristol, se trasladó a Virginia para poder operar legalmente.

El desarrollo técnico del registro ya está finalizado, pero la normativa legal aún se encuentra en trámite, y su aprobación no llegará a tiempo para la fecha prevista. Mientras tanto, los VMP no deberán registrarse ni asegurarse, excepto aquellos que superen los 25 kilos de peso y 14 km/h de velocidad máxima, que sí deben contar con un seguro obligatorio.

Según los datos del catastro, en 2025 un total de 38.357 inmuebles pertenecen a personas o empresas que poseen más de cinco propiedades, representando el 6,1 % del total del parque inmobiliario de las islas. Hace diez años, estas cifras eran de 30.776 viviendas (5,3 %), y en 2006 solo se alcanzaban 15.640 inmuebles (3,5 %). El tramo de propietarios con entre 6 y 10 viviendas es el que más ha crecido, pasando de 11.132 inmuebles en 2006 a 28.679 en 2025, un aumento del 157 %. Paralelamente, el porcentaje de pisos en manos de propietarios únicos ha descendido del 64 % al 54 %, indicando un aumento progresivo de los multipropietarios.

Este sistema está diseñado para actuar en caso de que el piloto quede incapacitado durante el vuelo, asumiendo el control del avión y llevándolo de forma completamente autónoma hasta el aeropuerto más adecuado. Durante el proceso, el Autoland no solo calcula el destino más apropiado basándose en la distancia, las condiciones de la pista y el combustible disponible, sino que además se comunica activamente con el control aéreo y con los pasajeros mediante mensajes de voz automatizados. El incidente ocurrió en una aeronave Beech B200 Super King Air que volaba entre Aspen y el Aeropuerto Regional de las Montañas Rocosas, en Colorado.

Inicialmente, el buque había partido de Estambul rumbo al Caribe con destino a Venezuela, transportando nafta destinada al régimen de Nicolás Maduro, pero modificó su trayectoria para eludir la vigilancia de la Armada de Estados Unidos. Agate forma parte de la llamada 'flota fantasma', compuesta por antiguos petroleros con banderas de conveniencia y sistemas de navegación que evitan el control internacional. La presión de EEUU sobre los buques que surcan hacia o desde Venezuela se intensificó recientemente con la incautación de dos petroleros y la amenaza de bloqueo total a los buques sancionados.

Partiendo de la definición de pseudoterapia de la Asociación Médica Mundial, el texto subraya que se trata de prácticas sin respaldo empírico que prometen beneficios para la salud, explotando la vulnerabilidad de las personas y retrasando el acceso a tratamientos eficaces.

Entre los ejemplos más extendidos se encuentran la acupuntura aplicada a trastornos psicológicos, la bioenergética, las constelaciones familiares, la dianética, las flores de Bach, la homeopatía, la programación neurolingüística y el reiki. Todas ellas comparten elementos comunes: la apelación a conceptos no demostrados como la “energía vital”, la “fuerza vital”, los “meridianos” o la “memoria del agua”, así como el uso de un lenguaje aparentemente técnico que pretende dotarlas de legitimidad científica.

Hasta noviembre, el Estado presentó un saldo positivo de 640 millones de euros, frente al déficit de 8.740 millones del mismo periodo del año anterior. Este cambio se debe principalmente al aumento de los ingresos tributarios, que crecieron un 9,4% en contabilidad nacional, mientras que el gasto público aumentó en un 5,5%, igualando el crecimiento del PIB nominal. La prórroga de los presupuestos estatales ha contenido parcialmente el gasto estatal, aunque aún está pendiente la subida salarial retroactiva de los empleados públicos. En contraste, las comunidades autónomas presentan un deterioro de sus cuentas, con un déficit creciente pese a la financiación récord, y solo País Vasco y Navarra mantienen superávit por su régimen especial.

C., Cartimandua entregó al rey celtíbero a los romanos, lo que consolidó su alianza con el imperio. A pesar de recibir recompensas por este acto, su decisión fue muy controvertida entre su pueblo. Además, su relación con Venutius, su esposo, se vio marcada por conflictos, incluyendo un intento de derrocamiento de Cartimandua en 57 d. C.

Según los informes municipales, mantener la gestión pública sería económicamente viable, lo que sugiere que la decisión responde a una elección política más que técnica.

Esta decisión se suma al relevo de Ortega Smith como portavoz adjunto del grupo parlamentario, lo cual él mismo calificó como 'injusto'.

La operación ha llevado a la detención de siete personas, que formaban parte de un grupo criminal dedicado al expolio de sitios como la antigua ciudad de Lancia, en León, y el yacimiento de Mayorga, en Valladolid. Los detenidos utilizaban detectores de metales de alta tecnología para extraer monedas, áureos romanos, fíbulas y otros objetos históricos, los cuales posteriormente vendían por internet o en transacciones privadas. Se estima que el valor de las piezas recuperadas podría rondar el millón de euros en el mercado negro. La investigación, que comenzó a principios de 2025, culminó con la incautación de más de 6.000 monedas, varios áureos romanos, y un importante número de objetos de valor histórico.

El programa mostró a jóvenes militantes y religiosos compartiendo su visión positiva de estos grupos, sin explorar suficientemente la relación de estos movimientos con la extrema derecha o su vinculación con la manipulación de la fe. José Antonio Naz Valverde, presidente de Europa Laica, denunció la falta de diversidad de opiniones en el programa, subrayando que el enfoque mediático distorsionó la realidad de la juventud española, dando una imagen distorsionada de la juventud como fervientes seguidores del catolicismo.

Aunque las formaciones ultranacionalistas europeas celebran el ataque a la UE, su apoyo está matizado, ya que la injerencia de Trump choca con su propio ideario ultranacionalista. Líderes como Giorgia Meloni y Nigel Farage ven la estrategia de Trump como una oportunidad para avanzar en sus propios intereses políticos, pero reconocen las limitaciones de una cooperación que no ofrece un proyecto ideológico común. A pesar de las diferencias, los líderes ultraconservadores europeos aprecian la postura de Trump en temas como la inmigración y la defensa. Sin embargo, la ausencia de una agenda común plantea interrogantes sobre la viabilidad de estos vínculos.

Este comentario se produce en un momento en el que el expresidente estadounidense se enfrenta a varias controversias internas, entre ellas las peticiones para desclasificar documentos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein. La anexión de Groenlandia, que es rica en recursos naturales y clave para la geopolítica del Ártico, ha sido un tema recurrente para Trump. En sus recientes declaraciones, ha incluso designado a un enviado especial, el gobernador republicano Jeff Landry, para impulsar esta propuesta.

En un comunicado, los comités aseguran que esta organización no solo participó en la distribución de ayuda con fines propagandísticos, sino que también se aprovechó de la catástrofe para obtener beneficios. A raíz de esta denuncia, los CLER piden que los responsables sean puestos a disposición judicial y que las donaciones desviadas sean canalizadas hacia ONG y asociaciones locales con criterios éticos y de justicia social. La organización también critica las políticas del partido Vox, especialmente su postura contra los migrantes, las mujeres y las lenguas cooficiales, acusándolos de usar la tragedia para fortalecer su imagen política.

Esta decisión ha generado controversia, ya que se ha considerado que estas obras no son esenciales para el dominio público marítimo-terrestre. Aunque inicialmente se había señalado que las instalaciones podrían ubicarse fuera de esta zona protegida, la promotora defendió que su construcción era necesaria para atender la demanda de servicios turísticos en la zona. La Dirección de Costas argumentó que el proyecto es beneficioso para la economía turística de las islas, un aspecto clave para el desarrollo económico canario. Sin embargo, esta autorización ha sido criticada por colectivos ecologistas que alertan sobre los posibles impactos ambientales de las obras.

Un informe de auditoría reveló que varios contratos menores no se ajustan a la normativa, especialmente en lo que respecta a patrocinios, algunos de los cuales deberían haberse tratado como subvenciones. Además, se identificaron complementos salariales indebidos a empleados de la Fundación, los cuales deberán ser reintegrados. Estos hallazgos han motivado a los partidos PSPV y Compromís a pedir la ampliación de la denuncia contra Badenas. La auditoría también destaca otras incidencias en la contratación de personal, en la que se cuestionan los procedimientos seguidos y las retribuciones otorgadas a varios directivos, incluida la del subdirector de emprendimiento.

Nuevos estudios ponen en duda esta hipótesis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Titán, la luna de Saturno, ha sido durante mucho tiempo uno de los principales objetivos de estudio debido a la presencia de sus mares y lagos de metano en la superficie. Sin embargo, la posibilidad de que Titán cuente con un océano interno global ha sido cuestionada por nuevos estudios que analizan los datos obtenidos por la sonda Cassini. En el pasado, los científicos pensaban que debajo de la corteza de Titán existía un océano de agua líquida, tal vez mezclado con amoniaco. Este océano se pensaba que tenía un grosor de alrededor de 250 kilómetros y estaba separado de la superficie por una capa de hielo. Pero recientes investigaciones sobre el momento de inercia de la luna, que mide su respuesta a las mareas ejercidas por Saturno, sugieren que podría no existir un océano global, sino varias capas de hielo de agua en diferentes estados de fusión, lo que implicaría que los mecanismos de deformación de la corteza no se explican por un océano líquido.

Se estima que en 2040 habrá medio millón de satélites en órbita baja (LEO), lo que impactará seriamente a misiones como el telescopio Hubble y el observatorio SPHEREx. El aumento de tamaño y brillo de los satélites, especialmente los nuevos Starlink v2 Mini, los hace más problemáticos para los telescopios. A pesar de que el problema no es urgente aún, las futuras misiones de exploración del cielo podrían ver un aumento significativo en la contaminación por satélites.

Según el escrito, el desenlace no fue resultado de una acción dolosa sino de imprudencias graves derivadas de una gestión sanitaria en el ámbito privado, mezclada con prácticas de curanderismo y automedicación. Entre los elementos clave se destacan los llamados “sobados” o masajes abdominales de origen curanderil realizados por personas sin formación sanitaria, que, según la defensa, pudieron agravar lesiones internas preexistentes. También se señala la automedicación continuada con ibuprofeno, administrado tras consultas en internet, como un factor que podría haber interferido con la coagulación y contribuido a una hemorragia interna.

Un estudio reciente liderado por científicos de la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago ha identificado cómo una proteína llamada factor plaquetario 4, que se reduce con la edad, está implicada en el deterioro de las células madre hematopoyéticas, las cuales producen las células de la sangre y el sistema inmunitario. Los investigadores demostraron que restaurar esta proteína en modelos animales y en células humanas puede revertir algunos de los efectos del envejecimiento, mejorando el equilibrio entre células mieloides y linfoides, lo que fortalece la respuesta inmunológica. Este hallazgo no detiene el envejecimiento general, pero abre la puerta a posibles tratamientos que podrían mejorar la salud de los mayores, como terapias dirigidas a mejorar el sistema inmunitario y optimizar los resultados de trasplantes.

Utilizando ondas acústicas dentro de un circuito cerrado de gas, esta tecnología permite transferir calor de zonas frías a zonas calientes de forma más eficiente que los sistemas tradicionales. El prototipo, basado en un ciclo Stirling termoacústico, logra temperaturas extremas sin recurrir a la combustión ni compresión mecánica. Este avance no solo mejora la eficiencia energética, sino que también abre la puerta a nuevas aplicaciones industriales, especialmente en sectores como la metalurgia y la petroquímica, que requieren calor a altas temperaturas. Además, la bomba de calor termoacústica tiene el potencial de reciclar calor residual de procesos industriales, lo que contribuiría a reducir el desperdicio de energía en China, donde se pierde entre un 10% y un 27% de la energía en forma de calor residual]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/avance-tecnologico-en-calefaccion-industrial-sin-emisiones-bomba-de-calor-termoacustica-capaz-de-alcanzar-270-c</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr: de pionera en el cine a inventora clave del WiFi]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hedy Lamarr, nacida en Viena en 1914, fue una mujer que rompió moldes tanto en el cine como en la ciencia.

El texto sostiene que la tercera entrega desplaza el foco del conflicto exterior hacia una cuestión íntima: ¿cómo educar a los hijos en un mundo que los percibe como una anomalía? Se exploran paralelismos con obras como Gran Torino, American History X y To Kill a Mockingbird, para sostener la idea de que el racismo no se transmite únicamente como ideología, sino como estructura familiar que se reproduce.

Este hallazgo contradice la creencia popular de que los motores de combustión son más eficientes. Según Johannes Kückens, físico alemán, los motores de combustión nunca podrán superar un 45% de eficiencia debido a las leyes de la termodinámica, mientras que los motores eléctricos pueden alcanzar cifras cercanas al 90%. A pesar de los avances en la tecnología de los vehículos de combustión, la eficiencia energética sigue siendo muy limitada. Kückens también criticó la apuesta de la Unión Europea por los biocombustibles o e-fuels, señalando que, con la misma cantidad de electricidad, un coche eléctrico puede recorrer seis veces más distancia que uno alimentado con e-fuels.

Durante su discurso, Serrat destacó sus orígenes humildes, recordando que su familia era trabajadora y cómo esa herencia fue una fuente de orgullo para él. A lo largo de su carrera, el cantante ha defendido la importancia de la clase obrera y se mostró sorprendido por el rechazo actual a que alguien se llame a sí mismo 'obrero'. En su opinión, los trabajadores deberían sentirse orgullosos de su labor, ya que son los que hacen avanzar a la sociedad. El acto también contó con la presencia de diversas personalidades del mundo político y cultural. La Medalla de Oro fue entregada por el presidente de la Generalitat, Salvador Illa, quien elogió la trayectoria de ambos homenajeados, resaltando el impacto de su trabajo en la cultura catalana y universal.

Las resoluciones judiciales no consideran que se haya producido un delito de acoso, al entender que las concentraciones, que incluían rezos y mensajes antiabortistas, no fueron suficientemente intimidatorias ni coactivas. Sin embargo, las expertas advierten sobre la ineficacia de la legislación actual para frenar el acoso ambiental y abogan por la creación de 'zonas de seguridad' alrededor de las clínicas. La reforma del Código Penal en 2022 introdujo un tipo de delito específico para tratar de frenar el acoso antiabortista, pero las sentencias sugieren que este tipo de conductas no encajan con los nuevos tipos penales, lo que dificulta la aplicación efectiva de la ley.

Llano County, lo que, según la pieza, podría permitir a gobiernos estatales y locales decidir qué materiales pueden leerse en bibliotecas y escuelas en Louisiana, Mississippi y Texas. Los autores destacan que esta decisión, al mantener la resolución de la Quinta Corte, podría debilitar el alcance de la Primera Enmienda y abrir la puerta a una ampliación de las prohibiciones de libros en todo el país. Se subraya que los esfuerzos de censura han aumentado en las últimas décadas y que las campañas suelen dirigir sus tácticas hacia comunidades rurales, con un fuerte énfasis en obras que tratan temas de raza, género y sexualidad, especialmente aquellas escritas por autores negros y LGBTQ+. Los bibliotecarios se presentan como una de las últimas líneas de defensa, frente a despidos y presiones para retirar materiales.

Este corte de energía, que dejó a unos 125,000 hogares y negocios sin electricidad, provocó que los vehículos autónomos de Waymo se quedaran parados en las calles. Sin semáforos funcionando, los coches sin conductor generaron importantes atascos, bloqueando intersecciones clave. Videos en redes sociales mostraron Waymos detenidos en fila, sin poder moverse mientras los conductores humanos pasaban a su lado. A pesar de que las autoridades restablecieron la electricidad poco después, la interrupción dejó a muchos conductores y peatones frustrados. Waymo decidió suspender su servicio por precaución, priorizando la seguridad de los pasajeros y el acceso de los servicios de emergencia.

Según la Cancillería de China, estas acciones, que incluyen la confiscación de dos buques que transportaban petróleo de Venezuela, son una forma de 'incautación arbitraria' y una infracción a la soberanía de otro país. China se opone a las sanciones unilaterales impuestas por Estados Unidos, que no cuentan con la autorización de la ONU. Las autoridades estadounidenses justifican estas acciones bajo el argumento de que los buques involucrados forman parte de una 'flota fantasma' que transporta petróleo venezolano para financiar el régimen de Nicolás Maduro. Caracas ha respondido a estas incautaciones calificándolas de 'robo' y ha prometido tomar medidas legales.

En una reciente intervención sobre los resultados electorales en Extremadura, Ayuso utilizó el escenario para reforzar su propio relato político, atacando al presidente Pedro Sánchez de forma personal y presentando su discurso como una constante lucha. Ayuso no se detuvo en los detalles de los resultados electorales ni en los retos reales de las comunidades autónomas, sino que se centró en posicionarse como la figura central de una polarización política. Su estilo se caracteriza por sustituir el debate y la reflexión por insultos y eslóganes vacíos, mientras alimenta la sensación de un país en crisis.

La política del presidente Zelenski, que permitió la salida de varones de entre 18 y 22 años para continuar sus estudios, ha resultado en una fuga masiva de jóvenes que evitan el alistamiento. A pesar de la ayuda que muchos reciben en países como Alemania, la situación es cada vez más insostenible para los gobiernos europeos. En este contexto, las perspectivas demográficas de Ucrania son preocupantes, con una disminución significativa de su población, que ha caído un 21% desde el inicio de la invasión rusa.

Esta decisión afecta a productos como quesos frescos, cuajadas y leche, con España como uno de los principales exportadores afectados.

Mientras el transporte por tren se volvía cada vez más puntual, las diferencias horarias entre poblaciones podían ser de hasta 45 minutos, como ocurría entre Barcelona y A Coruña. Este desajuste se convirtió en un desafío para el funcionamiento de los trenes, que necesitaban horarios más precisos para evitar accidentes. Fue así como se propuso la unificación de la hora, una medida que surgió en Inglaterra y que, poco a poco, fue adoptada en otros países. El sistema se basaba en el horario de Greenwich, que se convirtió en la referencia mundial. En España, la primera normativa se implementó en 1859, estableciendo que las estaciones ferroviarias debían ajustarse a la hora de Madrid. Este proceso, que comenzó con la sincronización de los relojes de las estaciones, culminó en 1900 con la adopción de un huso horario nacional. Así, el ferrocarril]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-unificacion-de-la-hora-en-las-ciudades-gracias-al-ferrocarril</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercadona pierde juicio por despido improcedente tras acusar a trabajadora de comer platos preparados]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una ex trabajadora de Mercadona ha conseguido que se declare improcedente su despido, después de ser acusada de consumir platos preparados al final de su jornada laboral.

Sin embargo, la trabajadora no reconoció los hechos y llevó a Mercadona a los tribunales, rechazando una oferta de 1.000 euros a cambio de admitir su culpabilidad. En el juicio, el Juzgado de lo Social de Terrassa consideró que las pruebas eran poco creíbles, ya que las declaraciones de las excompañeras no resultaron convincentes y existió un conflicto previo entre ellas.

A pesar de la baja demanda interna, España es un exportador destacado de carne de caballo y animales destinados al sacrificio, con un creciente número de caballos sacrificados para la industria cárnica. La industria ha sido objeto de críticas por parte de organizaciones de defensa de los animales, como Igualdad Animal, que alertan sobre las condiciones de estrés y maltrato que sufren los caballos, tanto en el transporte como en el sacrificio. La Autoridad Europea de Seguridad Alimentaria ha publicado informes sobre los riesgos para el bienestar de los équidos en el proceso de sacrificio, incluyendo aturdimiento inadecuado, hemorragias y lesiones, así como largas distancias de transporte.

La reciente postura adoptada por el ministro griego de Migración y Asilo, Thanos Plevris, al cuestionar la validez de la Convención de 1951 en el contexto de la migración masiva de 2025, refleja un giro hacia políticas más restrictivas y de corte conservador en el país. En un debate parlamentario, Plevris afirmó que la Convención fue creada para situaciones del pasado, como la huida de personas de la Unión Soviética, y no para los desafíos actuales derivados de los flujos migratorios. Esta postura ha sido criticada por los opositores, pero también encuentra apoyo en sectores más extremistas de la política griega. La crítica apunta a que las leyes de asilo en Grecia han sido modificadas repetidamente en un intento de evitar la aplicación de la Convención, especialmente mediante prácticas como las devoluciones en caliente.

A pesar de que se discuten temas como la subida de impuestos o la digitalización de la facturación, muchos autónomos están más preocupados por las bajas pensiones y las coberturas insuficientes que reciben en caso de baja médica o cese de actividad. Con una media de pensión de 1.010 euros al mes frente a los 1.507 euros de los asalariados, muchos autónomos temen por su futuro. Además, la falta de cobertura adecuada en caso de enfermedad o accidente también es un tema recurrente. Por ejemplo, si un autónomo cae enfermo, solo recibiría el 60% de su base reguladora durante los primeros 21 días, lo que podría no cubrir ni siquiera los gastos básicos debido a la cuota mensual que deben seguir pagando.

El resultado fue una de las inundaciones provocadas por el hombre más catastróficas de la historia, con miles de muertos y millones de desplazados, además de daños a tierras de cultivo y sistemas de riego que perduraron años. Aunque a corto plazo la acción dificultó un avance japonés hacia Shaanxi y Sichuan, el costo humano fue extremo y generó resentimiento rural hacia el régimen de Nanjing, que terminó reconociendo su responsabilidad en 1945.

Valla, a través del análisis filológico, señaló errores gramaticales, vocabulario inadecuado y referencias históricas imposibles para la época de Constantino, como la mención de Constantinopla antes de su fundación. Su estudio fue mucho más que una crítica académica, ya que tenía un trasfondo político, pues Valla trabajaba para el monarca aragonés Alfonso V, quien tenía disputas con el Papa.

A pesar de que los médicos habían indicado que se debía conservar el fragmento óseo para su reimplantación, este se perdió debido a una confusión con los restos de otra paciente. Para enmendar el error, la administración del hospital habría ofrecido a la familia un vale de 25 dólares para gasolina, lo que ha causado aún más malestar.

Aunque la moneda no busca reemplazar al dólar de manera inmediata, permitirá que los países miembros realicen transacciones entre sí fuera del sistema SWIFT, utilizando una plataforma propia llamada BRICS Pay. El oro, un refugio tradicional ante la volatilidad del dólar, juega un papel clave en esta estrategia.

En las rutas migratorias, las mujeres enfrentan no solo los peligros inherentes al viaje, como la violencia, sino una explotación sexual sistemática por parte de los traficantes. Aunque los migrantes en general deben pagar a los traficantes, a las mujeres se les exige un tipo de 'pago' mucho más cruel: servicios sexuales forzados. La violencia sexual es una de las amenazas más devastadoras para las mujeres migrantes, y la falta de protección y apoyo durante su travesía por Libia y otros territorios las pone aún más vulnerables.

La movilización masiva de reservistas, la destrucción de viviendas y negocios, y una creciente dependencia de los préstamos extranjeros han puesto a la economía israelí al borde del colapso. El gasto militar ha sido el principal motor económico, pero este modelo parece insostenible a largo plazo. El país ha visto un aumento significativo en la pobreza y la inseguridad alimentaria, mientras que sectores clave como la educación y la sanidad se deterioran debido a la desviación de recursos hacia la guerra. A pesar de estos problemas, algunos indicadores, como la apreciación del shekel y los récords en la Bolsa de Tel Aviv, sugieren que la economía aún funciona, pero solo gracias a un gasto público masivo y el endeudamiento externo.

Sin embargo, el CIS ha sobreestimado significativamente el apoyo al PSOE, un patrón que ya ha sido observado en anteriores estudios del organismo. Según el sondeo, el PP lograría entre 25 y 29 escaños, cifra que finalmente ha obtenido María Guardiola. Vox también ha acertado en su estimación, alcanzando los 11 escaños previstos, mientras que Unidas para Extremadura ha conseguido 7, tal como el CIS había anticipado. Por otro lado, el PSOE ha quedado por debajo de lo esperado, con solo 18 escaños, el peor resultado histórico en la región, frente a los 19-22 escaños predichos. Este desfase ha reavivado las críticas hacia el CIS, que es acusado de favorecer al PSOE en sus encuestas, un argumento que Tezanos ha rechazado, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cis-de-tezanos-acierta-en-las-predicciones-de-pp-vox-y-podemos-pero-sobreestima-al-psoe</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cis-de-tezanos-acierta-en-las-predicciones-de-pp-vox-y-podemos-pero-sobreestima-al-psoe</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hígado y FGF21: un posible interruptor biológico para reducir antojos de dulces y alcohol]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio realizado por City of Hope ha identificado una vía metabólica que vincula el estrés hepático con la producción de FGF21, una hormona que reduce el deseo de dulces y de alcohol. En condiciones de disfunción metabólica, como la enfermedad del hígado graso asociada a disfunción metabólica (MASLD), el hígado aumenta FGF21 para intentar restaurar el equilibrio. Los investigadores han descubierto que la acumulación de G3P activa ChREBP, lo que favorece la síntesis de grasa en el hígado y, a la vez, inhibe su quema. Este hallazgo sugiere que modulando la ruta G3P-ChREBP se podría controlar la producción de FGF21 y, por tanto, disminuir los antojos mientras se favorece la quema de grasa. Aunque el estudio aún se encuentra en fases iniciales, abre la puerta a posibles terapias que aprovechen esta vía para tratamientos de MASLD, disfunción metabólica y obesidad, y podría explicar por qué algunas personas delgadas padecen MASLD y muestran aversión a los dulces.

Aunque este régimen puede parecer opresivo, él lo considera más seguro y menos problemático que la situación política en Israel. Raz destaca que en su favela la violencia está controlada: quienes se desvían de las normas pueden acabar encerrados en un tanque de agua durante una noche. Para él, esto es preferible a lo que considera una democracia defectuosa en Israel. Su relato subraya la compleja relación entre seguridad, orden y libertad, especialmente en contextos donde el gobierno formal se percibe como ineficaz o injusto.

Las mujeres son las principales protagonistas de la vida cultural, leyendo más, asistiendo a más museos y conciertos, y participando en actividades como la pintura o el teatro. Según un informe de la Encuesta de Hábitos y Prácticas Culturales 2024-2025, el 71,7% de las mujeres lee frente al 59% de los hombres, y además gastan más en cultura. Este fenómeno se debe a factores como la educación, con una mayor presencia femenina en la universidad y una mayor socialización desde la infancia en actividades culturales. Por otro lado, los hombres prefieren actividades más físicas o tecnológicas, como los videojuegos o el gimnasio. A pesar de estas diferencias, la participación masculina en actividades culturales no es nula, sino que se concentra en el ámbito digital y doméstico. Este cambio de hábitos también refleja una brecha generacional, ya que los jóvenes tienden a consumir cultura de manera digital.

En un giro reciente, se ha desvelado que López Madrid intentó sobornar al comisario retirado Jaime Barrado para que el juicio contra él nunca llegara a celebrarse. El caso ha puesto de manifiesto la relación estrecha entre el empresario y varios policías, algunos de ellos implicados en escándalos como el caso Villarejo. A pesar de los intentos por desviar la investigación, la doctora Pinto ha sido exonerada de los cargos, mientras que López Madrid y el comisario Villarejo se enfrentan a un juicio en 2025 que podría llevarlos a prisión por corrupción y manipulación policial.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-corrupcion-policial-en-el-caso-lopez-madrid-la-implicacion-de-altos-mandos-para-proteger-al-empresario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-corrupcion-policial-en-el-caso-lopez-madrid-la-implicacion-de-altos-mandos-para-proteger-al-empresario</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 00:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallece el actor Celso Bugallo, premiado con el Goya por ‘Mar adentro’]]></title><description><![CDATA[El actor gallego Celso Bugallo ha fallecido a los 78 años en su ciudad natal, Pontevedra, el 20 de diciembre de 2025.

Estos centros, que consumen grandes cantidades de energía y agua, están afectando a las comunidades locales al elevar las facturas de electricidad y contribuir a la contaminación ambiental. A pesar de los millonarios proyectos que promueven gigantes como Amazon y xAI, muchos pueblos han logrado bloquear o retrasar inversiones millonarias. De hecho, durante 2023, las protestas locales han llevado al aplazamiento o cancelación de 20 proyectos, sumando pérdidas de hasta 98.000 millones de dólares. La creciente oposición también se debe a la preocupación por el impacto ambiental, como el caso de xAI, que enfrenta una posible demanda por la contaminación de su centro de datos en Memphis.

Aunque Trump no ha comentado sobre los archivos ni ha sido acusado de delitos relacionados con Epstein, la controversia crece debido a los documentos parcialmente censurados. En los archivos también se encontraron pinturas desnudas de mujeres en la residencia de Epstein.

En este proyecto, basado en los diarios de guerra de Lindgren, se explica que Pippi nació como una respuesta a los horrores de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el ascenso del nazismo. Durante esa época, Lindgren, que vivía en Suecia, fue testigo de las atrocidades cometidas por el régimen de Hitler, y su escritura se impregnó de una profunda preocupación por el autoritarismo y la opresión. La escritora, que se oponía abiertamente al nazismo, creó a Pippi como un símbolo de independencia, empatía y libertad, valores opuestos al culto a la fuerza y a la obediencia ciega. La creación de Pippi fue, además, una herramienta pedagógica para educar a los niños en un mundo marcado por la violencia y el autoritarismo, alentándolos a no convertirse en dictadores.

Los expertos han destacado la falta de respuestas adecuadas por parte del gobierno local y han denunciado la retórica estigmatizante utilizada por las autoridades, que describieron a los migrantes como una fuente de inseguridad sin pruebas que lo demuestren. La mayoría de los desalojados provienen de África occidental y subsahariana, y muchos de ellos ya habían sido desplazados de otras áreas en el pasado.

El 50,2% considera que necesita cambios fundamentales o profundos, mientras que solo el 48,5% expresa satisfacción. Este descenso se compara con 2019 y, especialmente, con el año anterior a la pandemia, reflejando una caída de cerca de 21 puntos porcentuales en la aprobación respecto al periodo pre-COVID. El informe, basado en encuestas a más de 2.400 personas, también muestra que la valoración de la sanidad pública se sitúa en 5,89 sobre 10.

El Departamento de Patrimonio Canadiense ha decidido retirar los nombres individuales previstos para ser inscritos en el monumento tras un informe gubernamental que vinculó a muchos de los 'víctimas' no verificadas con grupos nazis. Originalmente, se iban a inscribir 553 nombres en el muro conmemorativo diseñado por el arquitecto Paul Raff, pero tras el aviso de grupos judíos y medios de comunicación canadienses, más de la mitad de los nombres fueron retirados por su posible relación con el nazismo o el fascismo. Esta decisión subraya el compromiso del gobierno canadiense con los valores de democracia y derechos humanos, aunque no se ha especificado qué contenido temático ocupará ahora la pared del monumento. La polémica comenzó cuando el ministro conservador Jason Kenney promovió la idea en 2007, inspirado por un monumento similar en Toronto, pero l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-canada-se-eliminan-los-nombres-del-monumento-a-las-victimas-del-comunismo-tras-vinculos-con-el-nazismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/controversia-en-canada-se-eliminan-los-nombres-del-monumento-a-las-victimas-del-comunismo-tras-vinculos-con-el-nazismo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Málaga refuerza la seguridad en La Trinidad con diez nuevas cámaras de videovigilancia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Málaga ha puesto en funcionamiento un nuevo sistema de videovigilancia en el barrio de La Trinidad, dentro del distrito Centro, como parte de un contrato valorado en 79.828,9 euros. Se han instalado diez cámaras distribuidas en ocho puntos clave del barrio, como la calle Mármoles y la plaza de San Pablo, las cuales ya están conectadas con la Policía Local. Esta actuación se enmarca dentro de un proyecto más amplio que incluye también la instalación de cámaras en los accesos al Parque de San Rafael y futuras ampliaciones en áreas cercanas a las estaciones de trenes y autobuses. Según datos de la Policía Local, la presencia de cámaras en las vías públicas ha contribuido a resolver el 80% de los delitos registrados en las zonas vigiladas.

La operación, coordinada por el Servicio Central de Operaciones de la Policía, ha sido apoyada por diversas brigadas de prevención del delito. Durante la intervención, también se han llevado a cabo inspecciones en tiendas de cannabis debido a la implementación de un nuevo marco regulatorio, que clasifica incluso productos con CBD como narcóticos.

A través de un debate entre Lem, AsimoV, Casandra, Chess y otros, se exploran temas como la arrogancia, la inmortalidad y la tradición literaria. Lem defiende su obra como un homenaje al héroe mesopotámico Gilgamesh, mientras que AsimoV le reprocha la pretensión de enmendar la obra de los grandes narradores del siglo XX. Casandra interviene, cuestionando las pretensiones de los autores, y Chess aporta una visión crítica sobre el impacto de Borges y otros maestros literarios en la imaginación. La discusión transcurre en un contexto surrealista donde lo preternatural y lo literario se entrelazan.

'The Book' se distancia de los manuales de supervivencia al enfocarse en el ingenio humano y la creatividad para recrear una nueva sociedad. Con un enfoque artístico y poético, el libro no pretende ser una guía técnica, sino más bien una reflexión sobre cómo la humanidad podría reinventarse después de un colapso global.

En particular, una fotografía que mostraba a Trump, su esposa Melania, Epstein y Ghislaine Maxwell ha sido eliminada. Los demócratas, liderados por Chuck Schumer, han criticado la eliminación de material y sugieren que podría tratarse de un encubrimiento. Además, se han censurado una gran parte de los documentos, con más de 550 páginas completamente negras, lo que ha generado indignación, sobre todo entre los republicanos.

Los datos indican una caída significativa en las ventas de estos establecimientos, y el aumento de las tiendas de cercanía parece ser una de las principales razones. A su vez, las multinacionales han ido reduciendo su presencia en el mercado argentino, siendo la venta de Carrefour una de las más destacadas en este proceso. Según expertos, la falta de rentabilidad y los elevados costos de operación son algunos de los principales factores que están empujando a los inversores extranjeros a abandonar el sector.

Monsonís defiende que su obra, aunque periférica y muy independiente, ofrece una reflexión profunda sobre temas relevantes como el uso de la lengua como herramienta de represión. A través de una historia personal de su abuela, la película pone de relieve cómo los hablantes de valenciano fueron brutalmente perseguidos en la época franquista.

Sin embargo, esta tendencia no refleja un aumento de la estabilidad familiar, sino una realidad económica difícil. Un 20% de las parejas sigue conviviendo tras la ruptura debido a la falta de recursos para independizarse. El encarecimiento del alquiler y la escasez de viviendas disponibles, junto con los altos costes de fianzas y alquileres, han llevado a muchas personas a posponer su separación. En el caso de Lucía, una mujer con dos hijos pequeños, la imposibilidad de acceder a una vivienda de alquiler ha sido la principal razón para seguir compartiendo casa con su ex pareja. La falta de ayudas adaptadas a las familias con hijos y el alto coste de la vivienda son los principales problemas, que afectan especialmente a aquellos que se separan a edades más avanzadas. Los expertos insisten en la necesidad de reformas en las políticas de vivienda para]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-economica-retrasa-los-divorcios-en-espana-el-alto-coste-de-la-vivienda-obliga-a-muchas-parejas-a-convivir-por-necesidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-economica-retrasa-los-divorcios-en-espana-el-alto-coste-de-la-vivienda-obliga-a-muchas-parejas-a-convivir-por-necesidad</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 23:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Violenta agresión a un técnico de ambulancias en el Hospital de Alicante: le rompen la nariz y pierden el conocimiento]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un nuevo episodio de violencia en el Hospital General de Alicante tuvo lugar en la madrugada del 19 de diciembre, cuando un técnico de ambulancias fue agredido por familiares de un paciente. El incidente ocurrió tras la llegada de un joven de 17 años, que había ingerido alcohol, acompañado de su familia. Tras una discusión y amenazas hacia el personal sanitario, dos jóvenes agredieron al técnico, rompiéndole la nariz de un puñetazo y dejándolo inconsciente en el suelo. Además, intentaron agredir a un celador y arañaron a una enfermera. Aunque el joven paciente no sufrió daños graves, los familiares huyeron del lugar antes de que llegara la policía, que procedió a realizar una detención relacionada con el ataque. El Hospital General de Alicante ha condenado el ataque y ha ofrecido apoyo al profesional afectado, mientras que las autoridades continúan investigando el caso. Este episodio se suma a una creciente tendencia de agresiones al personal sanitario en la región, con 1.356 incidente]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/violenta-agresion-a-un-tecnico-de-ambulancias-en-el-hospital-de-alicante-le-rompen-la-nariz-y-pierden-el-conocimiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/violenta-agresion-a-un-tecnico-de-ambulancias-en-el-hospital-de-alicante-le-rompen-la-nariz-y-pierden-el-conocimiento</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 23:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las élites occidentales temen una 'intifada globalizada' por el modelo de control social que impulsa Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo de Jonathan Cook expone cómo las élites occidentales temen una 'intifada globalizada', no por el riesgo que represente para la población judía, sino por lo que implica en términos de lucha contra las estructuras de poder que oprimen a las masas. Israel, según el autor, está diseñando un modelo para tratar a los sectores 'sobrantes' de la población en un futuro con recursos limitados y un clima hostil. Este modelo, que ya se aplica en Palestina, está basado en la vigilancia masiva, el control social a través de la tecnología y la militarización de la policía, lo que podría extenderse a las sociedades occidentales. Cook sugiere que la resistencia a este sistema de opresión debería basarse en la solidaridad con Palestina, antes de que las mismas tácticas se usen contra los propios ciudadanos de los países occidentales. La 'intifada globalizada' se presenta como un llamamiento a la acción contra los abusos y la injusticia, inspirada en los movimientos anticolonialistas y las lu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-elites-occidentales-temen-una-intifada-globalizada-por-el-modelo-de-control-social-que-impulsa-israel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-elites-occidentales-temen-una-intifada-globalizada-por-el-modelo-de-control-social-que-impulsa-israel</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 22:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE.

La operación forma parte de un esfuerzo continuado por parte de las autoridades estadounidenses para hacer cumplir restricciones económicas y de tráfico marítimo impuestas en respuesta a prácticas consideradas ilícitas por la comunidad internacional. El buque involucrado, cuyo nombre no se especifica en el titular, habría sido detenido en aguas cercanas al país caribeño durante una misión coordinada entre agencias de seguridad y aduanas. Este hecho se enmarca en una serie de medidas diseñadas para presionar a actores que, según Washington, facilitan violaciones de sanciones o beneficios de regímenes sancionados. El movimiento podría tener implicaciones para la logística de exportaciones e importaciones regionales, así como para empresas navieras que operan en la zona.

Según datos del Banco Mundial, por primera vez, en 2024, la clase media mexicana supera el porcentaje de personas en situación de pobreza. Mientras que el 39.6% de la población se encuentra en la clase media, solo el 21.7% vive en condiciones de pobreza. Sheinbaum atribuye este cambio a las políticas públicas implementadas por la Cuarta Transformación (4T), que incluyen los Programas del Bienestar y aumentos al salario mínimo. A pesar de los desafíos económicos globales, México ha logrado una reducción de la pobreza del 13.6%, mientras que la clase media ha crecido un 12.4%. Estos avances han sido fundamentales para que México sea uno de los países de América Latina que más ha reducido la pobreza en los últimos años, según un informe de la Cepal. La mandataria subrayó que, aunque los avances son notables, aún queda trabajo por hacer para reducir la pobreza y mejorar las c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mexico-supera-por-primera-vez-a-los-pobres-en-porcentaje-de-clase-media-segun-sheinbaum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mexico-supera-por-primera-vez-a-los-pobres-en-porcentaje-de-clase-media-segun-sheinbaum</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suecia rechaza la denuncia de Assange contra el Nobel por premiar a María Corina Machado]]></title><description><![CDATA[La policía sueca ha decidido no abrir una investigación tras la denuncia presentada por Julian Assange contra la Fundación Nobel. El fundador de WikiLeaks alegaba que la concesión del Premio Nobel de la Paz a la opositora venezolana María Corina Machado vulneraba el testamento de Alfred Nobel. Según Assange, Machado apoya las acciones de Donald Trump en Venezuela, lo que contravendría los principios establecidos por el testamento del fundador. En la denuncia, Assange también solicitaba el bloqueo del cheque de 11 millones de coronas (aproximadamente 1 millón de dólares) prometido a Machado, argumentando que los fondos podían ser desviados para apoyar la agresión y los crímenes de guerra. La policía sueca, sin embargo, no encontró pruebas que sugirieran la comisión de un delito y, por lo tanto, no iniciará ninguna investigación. El Premio Nobel de la Paz 2025 fue otorgado a María Corina Machado por sus esfuerzos en favor de una transición democrática en Venezuela, aunque su apoyo al pre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/suecia-rechaza-la-denuncia-de-assange-contra-el-nobel-por-premiar-a-maria-corina-machado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/suecia-rechaza-la-denuncia-de-assange-contra-el-nobel-por-premiar-a-maria-corina-machado</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis crítico de la cobertura mediática sobre inocencia en EE.

Se analizan las posibles tensiones entre divulgación periodística y objetivos políticos, y se examinan las dinámicas entre instituciones y figuras intelectuales de relevancia como Noam Chomsky, en relación con casos judiciales y controversias mediáticas que han marcado la opinión pública. El artículo también contextualiza el papel de actores y entidades (incluido un servicio de correos) en la difusión de informaciones sensibles, y evalúa las implicaciones de estas prácticas para la credibilidad de las instituciones y la confianza ciudadana. Se destacan también posibles sesgos ideológicos y la necesidad de un periodismo riguroso que verifique hechos antes de promover conclusiones categóricas sobre inocencia o culpabilidad.

La corte, con sede en Luxemburgo, ha respaldado la acusación presentada por la Comisión Europea, que denunció deficiencias en la gestión de las aguas residuales en más de 50 aglomeraciones urbanas y áreas intermunicipales, especialmente en Andalucía y Canarias. En concreto, se señaló que en numerosas localidades no se garantizaba ni la correcta recogida ni la depuración adecuada de las aguas residuales, lo que incumple la Directiva europea sobre el tratamiento de aguas residuales urbanas. En particular, la sentencia destaca la falta de control sobre los vertidos en estas zonas, que no cumplen con los estándares exigidos.

A pesar de que la comunidad tiene la menor proporción de población extranjera de toda España, Vox ha incluido la inmigración como uno de los puntos clave de su programa electoral, mencionándola en 32 ocasiones. Isabel Pérez Moñino, portavoz del partido, ha alertado sobre el supuesto peligro de la 'inmigración masiva', aunque las estadísticas oficiales contradicen estas afirmaciones. Según el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), la población extranjera en Extremadura representa solo un 4,4% del total, y la región tiene el menor porcentaje de delitos cometidos por inmigrantes. A pesar de estos datos, Vox continúa asociando inmigración con inseguridad y con una crisis de vivienda que, según el partido, se vería agravada por la llegada de inmigrantes.

Su historia comenzó cuando se mudó al país nipón por amor, pero terminó enamorándose de este antiguo arte marcial. Todo empezó por casualidad cuando una lesión le obligó a quedarse en casa, y fue entonces cuando descubrió el sumo a través de la televisión. Fascinado por la técnica y el estilo de los luchadores, comenzó a investigar más sobre el deporte y decidió adentrarse en él. A pesar de ser adulto y no tener la complexión de un luchador tradicional de sumo, se dedicó con empeño a aprender, y en pocos meses ya se vio compitiendo en torneos. En su primer combate oficial, Stephen se enfrentó a un rival experimentado, lo que le dio la sensación de estar siendo atropellado por un coche.
