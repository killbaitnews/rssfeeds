Onlookers shouted warnings about her pregnancy, pleading with agents to release her, but one agent allegedly pressed his knees on her body while others used pepper spray against the crowd, including reporters. Protesters responded by throwing snowballs, and ICE called local police for backup. The Minneapolis Police Department later reported that no violence occurred against the officers. ICE successfully arrested the intended targets, a young Ecuadorian couple, while two U.S. citizens were also taken into custody for assaulting federal officers. The incident has raised concerns over ICE's use of force and racial profiling practices, particularly in light of previous reports involving the Somali American community.

It frames digital transformation as a strategic, cross-cutting, and progressive process aimed at integrating digital technologies—such as process automation, artificial intelligence, data analytics, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, and systems interoperability—into public policy design and service delivery. The central objective is to boost institutional efficiency, improve service quality for citizens, enhance government transparency, and foster a nimble, modern, and inclusive state. The piece emphasizes that true transformation goes beyond digitizing procedures; it requires organizational reengineering, inter-institutional collaboration, data-driven decision making, and a user-centric service approach.

The defendants include a regional parliament deputy from Bashkortostan, Dmitry Chuvilin, physician Alexey Dmitriev, retiree Yuri Efimov, and two veterans, Pavel Matisov and Rinat Burkeev. Prosecutors described the group as an organization preparing to overthrow the Russian government and accused them of distributing materials that urged violent seizure of power. The defendants disputed the charges, maintaining their innocence. All five have been in pretrial detention for over three and a half years. The verdict is not final and may be appealed. The case’s chronology suggests the group was detained in March 2022 after meetings at Ufa’s Stalin Museum, where they studied Marxist works and trained physically. The FSB allegedly infiltrated the group with a Ukrainian provocateur to record conversations.

The couple was found dead in their Los Angeles home, and their 32-year-old son has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Trump, shortly after the incident, posted on Truth Social referring to Rob Reiner as suffering from 'Trump Derangement Syndrome,' which Greene called 'classless' and inappropriate for a former president. Greene emphasized that the tragedy should be met with compassion rather than politicization, highlighting the family’s grief and the son’s reported struggles with drug addiction and mental health issues. Other politicians, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, also criticized Trump’s remarks.

It argues that the war has entered a protracted phase of attrition, with rising costs and political strain across Europe, extending beyond conventional fighting to include diplomatic, economic, informational, and cyber pressures. Metreweli’s comments imply that Western endurance, political unity, and the ability to absorb sanctions are being tested over time, with wear and fatigue taking precedence over a decisive breakthrough. The piece notes persistent diplomatic stagnation and deep splits among Western powers, complicating concessions and any potential deal. It also suggests the message targets UK allies and reflects concerns about sustaining public and political support for Ukraine amid budgetary limits, national priorities, and electoral cycles.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/western-resolve-and-political-cohesion-under-strain-in-prolonged-ukraine-war</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/western-resolve-and-political-cohesion-under-strain-in-prolonged-ukraine-war</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volkswagen closes Dresden plant, signaling deeper industrial and economic challenges in Germany]]></title><description><![CDATA[Volkswagen ended vehicle production at its Dresden plant in Saxony, marking the first permanent closure of a car factory in Germany after 88 years of operation. Described as a decision long anticipated as economically essential, the move underscores systemic weaknesses affecting Volkswagen, the German economy, and the global automotive industry. The company faces a projected requirement to fund approximately €160 billion over five years for electrification, software platforms, and new vehicle architectures. Historically, Volkswagen chose reductions in output or partial reconversions rather than outright plant closures, making Dresden’s shutdown symbolically significant as a showcase facility intended to demonstrate openness, innovation, and brand image. The company’s leadership, including Thomas Schäfer, acknowledged the decision as economically necessary rather than merely symbolic. Beyond Dresden, the decision signals to European automakers that Germany can no longer shield its indus]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/volkswagen-closes-dresden-plant-signaling-deeper-industrial-and-economic-challenges-in-germany</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/volkswagen-closes-dresden-plant-signaling-deeper-industrial-and-economic-challenges-in-germany</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 07:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Personalized CRISPR Gene Therapy Enables Infant With Rare Metabolic Disorder to Reach Developmental Milestones]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a significant medical milestone achieved through personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy. KJ Muldoon, an infant born with a rare and often fatal metabolic disorder, has begun taking his first steps after receiving a one-patient, customized gene therapy developed by physicians at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). A year earlier, doctors were uncertain whether KJ would survive infancy due to the severity of his condition.

KJ became the first person in the world to receive this type of individualized CRISPR-based treatment, designed specifically to correct the genetic defect responsible for his disorder. Before the therapy, his life was defined by prolonged hospital stays and constant medical monitoring. After receiving treatment earlier in the year, his health stabilized enough for doctors to discharge him in June, allowing him to return home with his family.

Since leaving the hospital, KJ has continued to grow and reach developmental milestones th]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/personalized-crispr-gene-therapy-enables-infant-with-rare-metabolic-disorder-to-reach-developmental-milestones</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/personalized-crispr-gene-therapy-enables-infant-with-rare-metabolic-disorder-to-reach-developmental-milestones</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump files $10 billion defamation lawsuit against BBC over Jan. 6 speech edit]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit seeking $10 billion in damages against the BBC, alleging defamation and unfair trade practices. The suit contends that the BBC broadcast a distorted version of his January 6, 2021 speech, combining two separate parts to misrepresent his remarks and to influence the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The BBC has not yet commented publicly; they had previously apologized for the edit but denied defaming Trump. BBC leadership changes followed the apology, with the chairman calling it an error of judgment. The lawsuit claims the broadcaster’s actions were a deliberate attempt to interfere in the election. The legal action arrives as Trump continues to pursue aggressive lawsuits against media organizations and critics who have challenged him. The BBC’s coverage and the edited footage related to Jan. 6 remain a point of contention in discussions about media accuracy and political influence.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-files-10-billion-defamation-lawsuit-against-bbc-over-jan-6-speech-edit</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-files-10-billion-defamation-lawsuit-against-bbc-over-jan-6-speech-edit</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA['I created a MONSTER.'

Authorities report that Eichorn, 40, believed he was communicating with a 17-year-old female online, but the person was actually an undercover police officer. He faces felony charges for soliciting a minor. Eichorn, married with four children, was taken into custody and booked by the Bloomington Police Department, who emphasized the seriousness of attempting sexual activity with a minor. The Minnesota Senate GOP and the state Republican Party both called for his resignation, citing the gravity of the allegations. The bill Eichorn helped sponsor drew national attention and criticism for potentially trivializing mental health issues and for its politically charged nature, defining 'Trump derangement syndrome' as paranoia triggered by opposition to Donald Trump.

Inspired by the EU Digital Services Act, the draft law would tackle not only illegal content but also misinformation and hate speech, broad provisions that could enable government action against politically inconvenient opinions. The process traces back to debates initiated by MP Jon Pult and subsequent joint statements by AlgorithmWatch, Digital Society, and the Mercator Foundation of Switzerland. After initial setbacks and pushback from civil society groups such as Pirate Party and Chaos Computer Club, the federal commission released a proposal that gradually advanced toward formal consultation. Key features include potential blocking powers for OFCOM (Swiss telecom regulator) to restrict platform access without a court order, substantial fines based on turnover, and a formal]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/switzerland-moves-to-regulate-platforms-and-search-engines-amid-concerns-over-misinformation-and-speech-control</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/switzerland-moves-to-regulate-platforms-and-search-engines-amid-concerns-over-misinformation-and-speech-control</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 21:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Iran Faces Severe Water Crisis Due to Overpumping and Dam Mismanagement]]></title><description><![CDATA[Iran is facing an unprecedented water crisis, described by experts as a state of 'water bankruptcy.' Years of poorly planned dam projects, overpumping of aquifers, and neglect of ancient qanat systems have drastically depleted both surface and underground water reserves. The qanats, centuries-old tunnels that sustainably tapped underground water, have largely fallen into disuse due to overpumping from modern wells, causing aquifer depletion and land subsidence. Iran's reservoirs are mostly empty, while rivers and wetlands have dried up, exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Afghanistan. Agriculture accounts for 90 percent of water usage, yet increasing numbers of wells produce less water than before. Hydrologists warn of impending food shortages, repeated water protests, and potential conflicts over water resources. Proposed solutions include restoring qanats, recharging aquifers, redirecting floodwaters, and shifting to less water-intensive crops, though government focus remains]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Australian bystander hailed as hero after Bondi Beach shooting intervention]]></title><description><![CDATA[A mass shooting occurred at Bondi Beach in Sydney, reportedly targeting a Hanukkah event, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. Australian police confirmed 12 dead and 29 injured, with investigations noting three attackers and significant police response. Among the bystanders, Ahmed al Ahmed, a Muslim father of two, was photographed grappling with one of the gunmen and wresting the weapon away, actions described by relatives and local media as having potentially saved numerous lives. Ahmed was shot twice during the confrontation and remained in hospital for surgery, according to statements from a cousin who spoke to 7NEWS. The incident drew political reactions and an official description of the event as a terrorist attack, though authorities had not yet verified the attackers’ identities or motives at the time of reporting.

The analysis suggests a substantial shift over the past decade, with the United States remaining dominant in the remaining areas. The article emphasizes the importance of advancements in areas that influence national security, economic competitiveness, and strategic autonomy. The ASPI tracker aggregates data across multiple disciplines to assess which countries are most actively developing and publishing breakthroughs in high-impact technologies. The piece contextualizes China’s rapid scientific expansion within broader geopolitical and economic strategies, including investment in research infrastructure and talent.

The leaked simulations, revealed by The New York Times, suggest that the Chinese military might be capable of neutralizing or even destroying the U.S. Navy’s flagship aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, in just a few hours under certain combat conditions. The exercises reportedly evaluated a range of modern weapon systems, including hypersonic missiles and anti-satellite technologies. These findings could represent a major strategic concern for the U.S. military, which has long promoted its global technological superiority. The USS Gerald R. Ford is an enormous vessel weighing 100,000 tons, measuring 333 meters in length, and costing an estimated 13 billion euros. It was designed as a symbol of American naval dominance following years of development and advanced engineering.

The piece suggests that what began as a moral crusade—defending democracy against Russian aggression—transformed into a rigid narrative that European leaders can no longer abandon without undermining their own legitimacy. This moral absolutism, Vermeulen contends, prevents any pragmatic approach to ending the war.

The author highlights structural flaws within the EU, describing it as a system designed to accumulate commitments such as sanctions and military aid, yet incapable of reversing them. The alliance’s deep dependence on the United States has turned transatlantic loyalty into a trap, leaving Europe more invested in the conflict than Washington itself.

This marks the first known instance of an underwater drone strike against a submarine of this type. The targeted vessel, a Project 636.3 ‘Varshavyanka’-class diesel-electric submarine, reportedly carried Kalibr cruise missiles used by Moscow in long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. According to the SBU, the operation was conducted jointly with Ukraine’s Naval Forces and the 13th Main Directorate of military counterintelligence. The strike left the submarine critically damaged, forcing it to remain in port and effectively removing it from combat service.

It argues that the timing and nature of the announcement aim to influence public opinion during a period when European capitals are pressing to prolong the war. The piece asserts that Russia has accused Western forces of conducting terrorist-style strikes against Russian civilian targets, and it claims that NATO troops from the UK, France, the US, Poland, and Germany have been deployed in Ukraine, contrary to official silence labeling them as mercenaries. Citing leaked Pentagon documents from 2023, the article alleges about 50 British special forces personnel were deployed, making them the largest NATO commando contingent in the conflict.

It asserts that Western leaders, including Obama and Biden, supported a 2014 Maidan uprising and installed a government aligned with U.S. interests, ultimately fueling a civil war in eastern Ukraine. The piece accuses policymakers and the arms industry of fabricating or amplifying narratives to justify continued arms transfers to Ukraine, claiming that these efforts have harmed both Ukrainians and Europeans by prolonging conflict and raising costs.

It seeks to tackle the increasing regulatory challenges posed by platforms that often evade accountability due to outdated legal structures. The CRT introduces a novel mechanism known as the 'regulatory sandbox,' which provides a controlled environment for technological experimentation while ensuring consumer protection and public interest safeguards.

This innovation aims to close the existing gap between rapid technological developments and slow regulatory adaptation, supporting startups and nontraditional actors such as universities and nanosatellite developers.

Initial estimates started around $175 billion, but costs have surged due to technical challenges, required infrastructure, personnel, ongoing maintenance, and research cycles. Bloomberg’s analysis suggests the program could reach approximately $1.1 trillion when considering personnel, ongoing operations, and adaptation to evolving threats. The plan, first outlined by Trump in May as a national security priority, draws inspiration from Israel’s Iron Dome but would cover the entire U.S. The timeline targets an operational launch around 2029, though experts warn this deadline is unlikely given the scale and complexity. A more compact version designed to counter a massive, single-adversary attack is already valued at about $844 billion, indicating substantial budgetary pressure and strategic cho]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/projected-golden-dome-missile-defense-could-exceed-1-trillion-per-bloomberg</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/projected-golden-dome-missile-defense-could-exceed-1-trillion-per-bloomberg</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 09:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Palestina 36’: A Film Linking British Colonialism and Modern Violence in Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses the Palestinian film *Palestina 36*, directed by Annemarie Jacir, which revisits the Palestinian uprising against British colonial rule in 1936. The film retells the events of the Arab Revolt (1936–1939), portraying the British Empire’s violent suppression of Palestinian resistance and its indirect role in laying the groundwork for the later establishment of Israel. According to the article, the British government positioned itself as a neutral mediator in Palestine but effectively facilitated European Jewish settlement, aiming to create a loyal regional outpost under imperial influence. The movie follows figures such as British officer Orde Wingate, known for organizing brutal night raids on Palestinian villages, who also trained early Jewish militias using British colonial warfare tactics. Jacir’s film draws parallels between Wingate’s tactics and those Israel employs today, depicting a historical continuity of colonial violence and military oppression.

The total number of positions rose by only 0.1% compared to the previous year, while the volume of full-time equivalent employment even declined by 0.1%. This minor fluctuation points to deeper issues in national competitiveness and economic dynamism.

The slowdown coincides with a steady rise in the labor force, putting increased pressure on job seekers. The third quarter data revealed that employment growth nearly halted, reflecting a general weakening of the labor market. Analysts attribute this trend partly to Switzerland’s rapid population increase, with more job applicants entering the market than new jobs being created.

Sectors most affected include finance — particularly in Zurich, the country’s main economic hub — and certain branches of manufacturing.

Thousands of American farmers who used paraquat for decades are now living with Parkinson’s disease, claiming exposure to the pesticide is responsible. Among them is Paul Friday, a Michigan peach farmer diagnosed in 2017, and Jim Krause, a California grower who died in 2024 after years of spraying his orchards. Lawsuits against Syngenta, paraquat’s manufacturer, and Chevron, its former distributor, have surged, with more than 6,400 cases pending nationwide. Plaintiffs allege the companies knew of paraquat’s neurological risks but failed to warn users. While Syngenta and Chevron deny any causal link, citing a lack of conclusive scientific proof, multiple studies — some dating back decades — have associated paraquat exposure with an increased risk of Parkinson’s.

Inspired by German artist John Heartfield, Zhitomirsky created photo collages that targeted both Nazi Germany during World War II and later, Western powers during the Cold War. His works combined sharp satire with striking imagery to expose what he viewed as the evils of fascism, capitalism, and imperialism. During the war, his photomontages were disseminated through Soviet publications and leaflets called 'Front Illustrierte,' which were airdropped over enemy territory to demoralize German soldiers by appealing directly to them. His contributions made him one of the Third Reich’s most wanted propagandists. After the war, Zhitomirsky faced persecution during Stalin’s anti-Semitic campaigns, which heavily restricted Jewish intellectuals under the Zhdanov Doctrine that enforced strict socialist realism in the arts.

The legislation, introduced by Labour, aims to strengthen protections for workers by preventing unfair dismissals, banning exploitative practices such as 'fire and rehire,' and ensuring employees receive sick pay from their first day off. It would also limit employers' ability to arbitrarily change workers' hours or conditions. Following the vote, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) visited Clacton, the seaside constituency represented by Farage, to inform residents about his stance. Many local voters expressed surprise and disappointment, saying they believed Farage supported ordinary people and workers.

European leaders, including Germany’s Friedrich Merz, Poland’s Donald Tusk, and EU Council President Antonio Costa, have criticized the strategy for allegedly neglecting Europe’s interests and weakening transatlantic solidarity. However, the article argues that such responses reveal Europe’s dependence on the United States for security and its aversion to pursuing genuine strategic autonomy. Mamedov introduces the concept of 'vicarious primacy'—Europe’s illusion of global influence derived from acting as Washington’s junior partner.

This innovation enables dynamic adjustment of the rotor's magnetic flux to improve performance and energy efficiency across different driving conditions. Traditional permanent magnet motors rely on a constant magnetic field, which provides strong torque at low speeds but causes energy losses at higher speeds due to increased counter-electromotive forces. BYD's variable-flux system addresses this limitation by actively modifying magnetic intensity within the rotor based on speed and load, reducing unnecessary energy consumption and improving overall efficiency.

Known for its jarring red and yellow contrast, this theme has long been regarded as a humorous or deliberately bad design choice. However, Virginia Howlett, Microsoft’s first interface designer and co-creator of the Verdana font, clarified that it was never intended as a joke. She explained that she and a small design team created multiple themes using the limited 16-color palette available at the time, including subdued options like 'Bordeaux' and 'Tweed.' The bright and clashing 'Hot Dog Stand' merely offered an alternative for users who preferred bold colors. Though some designers debated whether to include it, the theme ultimately shipped with Windows 3.1’s 1992 release. Over the years, the bizarre palette became a cultural curiosity and a symbol of early user interface experimentation.

The U.S. Treasury highlighted that the group trains soldiers, including minors, to fight with the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been accused of targeting civilians. Four individuals and four entities were targeted by these sanctions, including Álvaro Andrés Quijano Becerra, an Italian-Colombian who resides in the United Arab Emirates and is described as playing a central role in recruiting and deploying Colombian veterans in Sudan. Since September 2024, hundreds of ex-South American troops have reportedly fought alongside the RSF in several battles, such as the recent seizure of El-Facher, a major Darfur city.

Despite lacking coastlines or ports, Switzerland's Federal Council imposed measures targeting several ships, entities, and individuals recently added to the sanctions list. The measures affect 22 new entities and 42 new companies, freezing assets and restricting entry for individuals. Additionally, five Russian banks and four of their subsidiaries established in third countries face transaction prohibitions, particularly given their use of Russian payment systems. The article also notes penalties extending to eight third-country companies that undermine the sanctions' objectives.

The article recounts a 1996 birthday spectacle where Michael Jackson performed for Hassanal Bolkiah, highlighting the extravagant expenditure tied to the monarchy, including a private jet and a venue built for the event. It spotlights the Billionth Barrel Monument, symbolizing Brunei’s oil-and-gas wealth that funds broad social welfare—education, health, housing, and subsidies—while imposing a low tax rate. The piece details Brunei’s path to independence (1984), its early elections in 1959 and subsequent suppression under a state of emergency and martial law, and the monarchy’s enduring grip on power. A striking geographic quirk is Brunei’s division into two non-contiguous territories, separated by an area now part of Malaysia, a situation arising from a late 19th-century arrangement with the Raj of Sarawak.

The incident was reported on Friday and highlights Iran’s ongoing struggle against widespread fuel smuggling operations by land and sea. Iran’s heavily subsidized fuel prices, among the lowest in the world, and the steep decline in its national currency have made fuel trafficking increasingly profitable for smugglers exporting to neighboring and Gulf Arab countries. 

The state broadcaster IRIB shared the news but did not provide specific details about the name or nationality of the seized tanker. The seizure continues a series of similar actions in recent years as Iran’s naval forces, including units tied to the Revolutionary Guard, have frequently intercepted vessels accused of smuggling petroleum products or violating maritime laws in regional waters.

On April 30 of that year, test pilots Al White and Col. Joe Cotton faced a critical emergency during a flight from Edwards Air Force Base when the aircraft’s nose landing gear jammed halfway due to an electrical short-circuit. The malfunction shredded the tires and disabled both the main and backup hydraulic systems, leaving the crew unable to deploy the landing gear properly. Without it, a safe landing was virtually impossible given the Valkyrie’s massive size and speed characteristics. After spending hours troubleshooting from the ground and cockpit, engineers discovered that the issue was a failed circuit breaker. The only way to restore power was to manually bridge two terminals—something impossible without tools at hand. Thinking quickly, Col.

The article critiques the legal basis for designating groups as domestic terrorists, arguing that NSPM-7’s labels lack clear statutory grounding and may enable extrajudicial force lacking due process.

This EVA stands out for three main reasons. First, its duration made it one of the longest spacewalks ever recorded. Second, it introduced the new generation of Feitian D and E spacesuits, designed for 20 missions across four years — a clear improvement over the earlier A and B models. These new suits were delivered to the station in July 2025 aboard the Tianzhou 9 cargo spacecraft. Third, the astronauts conducted a direct inspection of a damaged window on the uncrewed Shenzhou 20 spacecraft, suspected to have been hit by debris or a micrometeoroid. The inspection was necessary to ensure safe reentry after the detection of cracks that previously forced the Shenzhou 20 crew to return aboard Shenzhou 21.

This decision diverges from Brussels’ efforts to secure new funding mechanisms aimed at supporting Kyiv in its ongoing conflict with Russia. According to Babis, Prague will neither provide financial contributions nor accept any guarantees related to these plans, which involve using frozen Russian assets and additional national backing. His stance places the Czech Republic at odds with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other EU leaders seeking to sustain Ukraine through coordinated financial measures.

However, the Fallout season one recap inaccurately stated that The Ghoul’s backstory takes place in the 1950s instead of the correct year, 2077. It also misrepresented a key plot decision by Lucy MacLean, claiming she was offered a choice to 'die or leave' with The Ghoul, which oversimplified the actual context involving potential danger from the Brotherhood of Steel. These factual mistakes led Amazon to remove AI recaps not only from Fallout but also from other test titles like The Rig, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Upload, and Bosch.

This decision aims to strengthen Europe’s role as a global space power and ensure competitiveness with the US, China, and Russia, while fostering strategic cooperation with India and Japan. Although the ESA’s investment increased by €5 billion compared to previous years, Europe’s overall spending on space activities is still notably lower than that of the United States. The ESA plans to develop reusable launch systems and to reduce reliance on former Russian technology. 
A significant example of Europe’s growing military-space integration is the French company Hemeria, based in Toulouse.

The downgrade follows President Donald Trump’s return to office in January 2025, which the organization says precipitated numerous executive actions and restrictive laws curbing civil liberties. Secretary General Mandeep Tiwana described the backsliding of rule of law and democratic norms as alarming, citing an ongoing campaign to silence criticism and dissent.

The report documents militarized crackdowns on public protests, including Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in major U.S. cities such as Los Angeles, and increased use of ICE agents to police immigrant communities and protest gatherings.

Zanzibar, originally under Portuguese and later Omani control, had become a key British ally by the mid-19th century due to its strategic location along trade routes to India. Although the British pressured the island to abolish slavery, a practice that formed a large part of its economy, tensions remained strong among local Arab elites who relied on the slave trade.

When Sultan Hamad died in 1896, his cousin Khalid seized power without British approval, proclaiming himself ruler. The British, favoring another candidate, Hamoud, demanded Khalid’s abdication within 24 hours. When Khalid refused, British naval forces stationed nearby opened fire two minutes after the deadline.

The dispute arises from the freezing of approximately 235 billion U.S. dollars in Russian assets deposited in Europe following the European Union’s sanctions imposed after the start of the Ukraine conflict. According to the Russian Central Bank, Euroclear’s actions have caused financial harm by preventing Russia from managing its liquid assets and securities. Moscow argues that the use or repurposing of those assets violates international law, specifically the principle of sovereign immunity.

The lawsuit comes amid the EU’s recent decision to make the sanctions against Russia permanent.

Este incremento ha tensionado especialmente las Urgencias de los hospitales de València y ha aumentado la presión asistencial, con registros de más de 500 pacientes diarios en algunas unidades. Ante la saturación en los hospitales de la ciudad, muchos pacientes optan por desplazarse a centros comarcales como Requena, Llíria, Alzira o Sagunt, donde, según testimonios, las listas de espera de atención primaria son largas y la atención en Urgencias es percibida como más rápida.

El presidente ruso sostiene que Ucrania no está preparada para discutir la cesión de territorios a Rusia y exige la retirada de las tropas ucranianas de Donetsk para declarar control total sobre Donbass. Al mismo tiempo, acusa a Ucrania de la crisis iniciada en 2014 y señala que las causas subyacentes del conflicto deben abordarse para lograr una paz estable. Putin recordó el origen del conflicto vinculado a un golpe de Estado en Ucrania en 2014 y a los acuerdos de Minsk, y afirmó que las negociaciones deben basarse en principios previamente expuestos por Rusia, incluyendo la neutralidad de Ucrania y la reducción de su ejército, además de exigir el reconocimiento internacional de las adquisiciones territoriales rusas de 2022 y la cooperación en materia de seguridad a medio y largo plazo.

Sin embargo, la crónica señala varias inconsistencias: De los Santos tenía 17 años en la fecha de las elecciones del 3 de marzo de 1996 y no habría podido votar, ya que no alcanzaba la mayoría de edad hasta agosto de ese año. Además, la promesa de acabar con la mili no figuraba en el programa electoral del PP para 1996. El texto detalla que la eliminación de la mili se gestó posteriormente, en el marco del pacto del Majestic con CiU y, finalmente, con la Ley 17/1999 y el Real Decreto 247/2001 bajo el Gobierno de Aznar. Se describe también que la imagen pública de Aznar y el PP sobre este tema se hizo suya años más tarde, pese a no figurar en el programa original de 1996. La pieza contextualiza la evolución del servicio militar en España y desmonta la idea de una promesa electoral explícita de “quitar la mili” en 1996, subr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-supuesto-voto-de-de-los-santos-en-1996-y-la-promesa-de-la-mili-verificacion-de-datos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-supuesto-voto-de-de-los-santos-en-1996-y-la-promesa-de-la-mili-verificacion-de-datos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 19:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EEUU sanciona a jueces de la Corte Penal Internacional que investigan crímenes israelíes en Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[Estados Unidos ha impuesto sanciones a dos jueces de la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI), Gocha Lordkipanidze de Georgia y Erdenebalsuren Damdin de Mongolia, como parte de una política adoptada por la administración Trump para presionar a la CPI por investigar los crímenes cometidos en Gaza. Según el Departamento de Estado de EEUU, estos jueces habrían participado en intentos de procesar a ciudadanos israelíes sin el consentimiento de Israel, lo que va en contra de la postura oficial estadounidense que rechaza la jurisdicción de la Corte. Esta medida es una continuación de las sanciones previas impuestas a otros miembros de la CPI, incluidos jueces y fiscales, que han trabajado en investigaciones sobre Palestina o Afganistán.

Se destacan ahorros significativos en consumo de combustible para turismos y autobuses: un turismo puede dejar de consumir entre 825 y 1.125 litros de gasolina o diésel al año, mientras que los autobuses eléctricos pueden ahorrar alrededor de 22.500 litros de diésel anuales frente a sus homólogos de combustión. En términos de emisiones, un turismo podría evitar unas 1,8 toneladas de CO2 al año y un autobús unas 54,2 toneladas anuales, considerando un mix eléctrico nacional de CO2 por MWh de 0,107. El artículo también subraya el impacto económico y estratégico, como la reducción de importaciones de petróleo (aproximadamente 4,4 millones de barriles al año) y la menor dependencia de divisas, aun cuando el precio del petróleo se mantenga bajo.

Aunque Piñeyro cuenta con todos los permisos necesarios de la Embajada de Palestina, el Gobierno de Egipto y La Cruz Roja, aún no ha recibido la respuesta del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Argentina. A pesar de esta demora, Piñeyro está dispuesto a redirigir la ayuda a otros destinos si la situación no se resuelve pronto.

La práctica, conocida como el 'Protocolo Mosquito', involucra la coacción de palestinos a realizar tareas peligrosas, como caminar por zonas con posibles trampas explosivas, para proteger a los soldados israelíes. Uno de los casos más impactantes implicó a un hombre palestino de 80 años, quien fue forzado a recorrer casas deshabitadas con un cable explosivo atado a su cuello mientras los soldados lo amenazaban con detonarlo. Este tipo de abusos no son incidentes aislados, sino que forman parte de una estrategia sistemática que se ha intensificado desde el comienzo de la guerra de Gaza en octubre de 2023.

El trabajo utiliza un enfoque de electrodo diluido para aislar las partículas activas de carbono duro y medir con precisión la velocidad de inserción de sodio frente a litio. Los resultados indican que la sodación es intrínsecamente más rápida en ese material, con coeficientes de difusión aparentes mayores para el sodio. Además, el paso limitante durante la carga es el llenado de los poros del carbono duro, lo que se asocia con una menor energía de activación para el sodio frente al litio.

Aunque la Guardia Civil intervino, ambos implicados fueron identificados, pero no se realizaron detenciones.

En un mensaje de WhatsApp, Abascal le pidió al presidente de Revuelta, Jaime Hernández, que solucionara la situación 'cuanto antes' y que tras ello pudieran retomar su relación en términos amistosos, sin preocuparse por cuestiones de fidelidad al partido.

Aunque Vox fue consciente de las irregularidades desde primavera, no fue hasta diciembre cuando formalizó la denuncia.

Según la información difundida por la administración de Washington, las naves estaban vinculadas a organizaciones designadas como terroristas y participaban en operaciones de narcotráfico. El balance preliminar indica que murieron cinco personas (tres en la primera embarcación y dos en la segunda), sin reporte de víctimas entre las fuerzas estadounidenses. El Pentágono señaló que estas embarcaciones transitaban por rutas de narcotráfico reconocidas y operaban en coordinación con redes ilícitas, reforzando la narrativa de enfrentamiento contra el narcotráfico.

La decisión, adoptada el 18 de diciembre de 2025, confirma la resolución anterior del juez Vicente Ríos, quien ya había desestimado las acusaciones por considerar que no existían pruebas suficientes para llevar a Oltra a juicio. El fiscal Jaime Cussac también ha respaldado esta postura, argumentando que las acusaciones de Vox y la asociación Gobierna-te no han aportado indicios específicos contra la exdirigente de Compromís. La causa, relacionada con el supuesto encubrimiento de los abusos sexuales cometidos por el exmarido de Oltra, sigue siendo objeto de controversia, pero la falta de pruebas claras ha llevado a la jueza a archivar el caso.

Krishna sugiere que, con inversiones acumuladas que podrían ascender a unos ocho billones de dólares y con rendimientos anuales necesarios cercanos a los 800.000 millones para cubrir el coste de capital, la economía de estos proyectos podría resultar insostenible bajo los supuestos actuales. Este análisis se apoya en la depreciación de los aceleradores de IA, que suelen amortizarse en cinco años, lo que implicaría reemplazo frecuente de hardware y, por tanto, un ciclo de gasto extremadamente agresivo.

Aunque la recaudación ha aumentado gracias a la desaparición de ciertas rebajas fiscales y a la mejora del empleo, la cifra española se mantiene unos puntos por debajo de la media de la UE y de la zona euro. Varios expertos señalan que la mayor parte de la presión fiscal en España proviene de impuestos sobre el trabajo y las cotizaciones sociales, con una menor captación en IRPF e IVA en relación con la renta. Se advierte que para sostener servicios públicos y pensiones ante el envejecimiento de la población, España necesitaría una mayor recaudación, acercándose a la media europea, lo que podría requerir reformas que enfoquen la recaudación también hacia impuestos al consumo y reducciones de desgravaciones en el IRPF.

Este es el tercer ajuste de costes desde el inicio del proyecto y supone un incremento del 8% respecto a la última revisión de 2023. La compañía atribuye esta subida a los riesgos asociados a la magnitud del proyecto, que se espera comience a producir electricidad en 2038. La decisión de EDF se produce en un contexto de precios eléctricos bajos, demanda inestable y una elevada deuda de la empresa, estimada en 50.000 millones de euros. El proyecto requiere apoyo estatal en forma de préstamos garantizados y será evaluado por la Comisión Europea en 2026 para determinar su viabilidad.

Además, la promoción de valores materialistas y la influencia de las redes sociales contribuyen a un sentimiento de desesperanza. Los expertos destacan la insuficiente oferta de servicios de salud mental y la falta de atención a la Ley 26.657 de Salud Mental como factores que agravan la situación. La situación es aún más grave por la falta de redes de contención eficaces.

En los últimos días, tres personas han perdido la vida tras pasar horas de espera en las instalaciones del hospital. Un hombre de 82 años falleció después de esperar 40 horas, mientras que dos mujeres, de 92 y 93 años, murieron tras permanecer 70 y 58 horas, respectivamente, en la sala de urgencias. Los sindicatos CGT y FTC-IAC han presentado una denuncia por lo que consideran un 'abandono colectivo ilegal en un servicio público'. La situación en el hospital refleja el colapso de los servicios de salud pública en la ciudad, donde la demanda supera ampliamente la capacidad de respuesta.

Sin embargo, varios expertos y la propia Guardia Civil de Tráfico advierten que este dispositivo podría no ser suficiente en ciertas situaciones. Por ejemplo, algunos especialistas en seguridad vial aseguran que la visibilidad de la baliza es limitada, especialmente en curvas o cambios de rasante durante el día. Por este motivo, recomiendan seguir utilizando los triángulos de emergencia como una medida adicional de seguridad. Incluso un bombero que atendió un accidente afirmó que 'no dejéis de llevar los triángulos'. La Guardia Civil también apoya esta recomendación, destacando que cuantos más elementos de señalización se utilicen, mejor. No obstante, el presidente de Automovilistas Europeos Asociados, Mario Arnaldo, ha señalado que los triángulos pueden suponer un riesgo para los peatones al ser colocados en la vía.

Vox acusó al gobierno autonómico de gastar más de 240.000 euros para que las ranas pudieran 'beber agua de pilones'. Sin embargo, los usuarios de Twitter han explicado que estas rampas tienen un propósito mucho más profundo: evitar el ahogamiento de ranas y otros animales, además de permitir que otras especies, como el ganado, también accedan al agua. La medida busca conservar la biodiversidad y mejorar la calidad del agua de los abrevaderos en la provincia de León. A pesar de las críticas iniciales, los tuiteros han corregido la desinformación de los ultras, aclarando el objetivo ecológico de esta iniciativa.

Durante años, afirma el autor, se ha negado sistemáticamente que la ampliación de la OTAN hacia el este fuera un factor decisivo para el conflicto, así como el papel de Estados Unidos en los acontecimientos de 2014 en Kiev y en la posterior guerra en el Donbás. A juicio del texto, esta narrativa ha ocultado la realidad estratégica y ha alimentado expectativas irreales sobre una derrota militar de Rusia mediante el envío continuo de armamento occidental.

Según el artículo, ese relato ha terminado atrapando a quienes lo difundieron.

Cualquier influencia durante esta etapa puede afectar de manera significativa al futuro intelectual de los niños. Un estudio reciente reveló que los niños educados en un entorno religioso tienen dificultades para diferenciar la realidad de la ficción. El estudio, realizado por investigadores estadounidenses, comparó a niños de entre 5 y 6 años de edad, con diferentes niveles de exposición a la religión, como en escuelas públicas, colegios religiosos y catequesis. Los resultados mostraron que los niños que recibían educación religiosa eran más propensos a aceptar como reales los relatos que incluían elementos sobrenaturales o milagros, mientras que los niños sin esa formación religiosa distinguían claramente entre hechos reales y ficción. Este estudio pone de manifiesto cómo el adoctrinamiento religioso puede alterar la capacidad de razonamiento y distorsionar la percepción de la realidad en los niño]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-adoctrinamiento-religioso-en-la-capacidad-de-los-ninos-para-distinguir-entre-realidad-y-ficcion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-adoctrinamiento-religioso-en-la-capacidad-de-los-ninos-para-distinguir-entre-realidad-y-ficcion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez critica la decisión de la UE de alargar la vida de los coches de combustión]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez ha calificado de 'error histórico' la decisión de la Comisión Europea de eliminar la prohibición de los coches con motor de combustión para 2035.

Según el atestado, se afirmó que Víctor de Aldama «contactó» e «intermedió» con el director general de Minas, Manuel García Hernández, poco antes de que la empresa de su socio presentara documentación para obtener una licencia que no obtuvo hasta casi dos años después. El análisis de mensajes recuperados de un teléfono incautado mostró que el supuesto contacto pudo ser un malentendido: el código encontrado indicaba un usuario llamado Manuel García Maroto y la palabra inglesa “stranger” (desconocido), lo que sugiere que Aldama no tenía ese contacto entre sus contactos y que el interlocutor fue quien envió el mensaje.

Tita, una de las exnumerarias, compartió su experiencia de ser captada a los 16 años bajo la falsa promesa de estudiar en Argentina, solo para encontrarse trabajando sin salir a la calle y vestida con un uniforme de ama de casa. Las denuncias han llevado a la acusación de varios líderes del Opus Dei por trata de personas, y la noticia ha alcanzado incluso al Vaticano.

Un estudio realizado por la Universidad de Murcia y el Consejo Económico y Social señala que, aunque la economía sumergida ha disminuido en los últimos 20 años, el fraude fiscal y laboral sigue siendo elevado. Sectores como la agricultura, los trabajos domésticos y la hostelería son especialmente vulnerables a estas prácticas, que afectan principalmente a mujeres migrantes y personas en situación de vulnerabilidad. A pesar de los esfuerzos de las autoridades, la falta de recursos en la inspección fiscal y laboral es un obstáculo crucial.

El objetivo del proyecto es la construcción de 22 apartamentos turísticos con piscina, lo que ha generado críticas por parte de Compromís, que denuncia un incremento de la turistificación y la pérdida de patrimonio en el barrio. Según la portavoz Papi Robles, estas decisiones reflejan una política que acelera la turistificación y favorece la especulación, expulsando a vecinos con rentas asequibles y reemplazándolos por residentes de altos ingresos.

El borrador del mensaje, que se descartó en su momento, solicitaba a los ciudadanos permanecer en sus domicilios debido a las fuertes lluvias y el riesgo de inundaciones en varias localidades. Sin embargo, la versión final que llegó a los móviles de los valencianos solo pedía evitar los desplazamientos, sin hacer mención explícita al confinamiento. Este cambio de enfoque en el mensaje se debe a las dudas legales sobre las competencias del gobierno autonómico para ordenar el confinamiento, lo que retrasó su emisión.

Las manifestaciones, que comenzaron de forma pacífica en el Barrio Europeo, derivaron al mediodía en enfrentamientos con la policía belga, que utilizó cañones de agua y gases lacrimógenos para dispersar a los manifestantes. Los agricultores respondieron con el lanzamiento de patatas y petardos, registrándose un herido grave y varios detenidos. 

Los manifestantes denuncian que las reformas planteadas por la Comisión Europea y los acuerdos comerciales con países extracomunitarios ponen en peligro la viabilidad del campo europeo al introducir competencia desleal.

Aunque Okdiario afirmó haber tenido acceso a una orden de pago, la sentencia señala que la información estaba basada en indicios y documentación no verificada; además, señala que la fuente principal, Eugenio Pino, afirmó que la investigación era embrionaria y que los documentos eran fotocopias, lo que dificultaba su autenticidad.

Lucas asegura que este proceso es una experiencia deshumanizadora que dificulta enormemente la búsqueda de vivienda, no solo para pisos completos, sino también para alquilar habitaciones.

Según el informe FOESSA de 2024, Càritas alerta de la alta precariedad social en esta región, especialmente para los jóvenes y los inmigrantes, quienes experimentan tasas de pobreza mucho mayores que la media. Aunque ha disminuido la pobreza extrema, el coste elevado de la vivienda sigue empujando a muchos a una situación de vulnerabilidad. El informe también señala que un 15% de los hogares enfrentan pobreza severa tras pagar el alquiler. Esta situación ha impulsado una alta demanda de habitaciones compartidas, lo que ha incrementado también el precio del alquiler. Historias como la de Leidy Katherine Cubides y Brayan León Chacón, una pareja colombiana que lucha por encontrar una vivienda digna, ilustran la dura realidad de quienes intentan sobrevivir en un mercado inmobiliario cada vez más inaccesible.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-emergencia-social-en-el-area-metropolitana-de-barcelona-400-000-personas-viven-en-condiciones-de-amontonamiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-emergencia-social-en-el-area-metropolitana-de-barcelona-400-000-personas-viven-en-condiciones-de-amontonamiento</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 00:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PROGRAMA ARTEMIS es un SINSENTIDO]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo cuestiona el programa Artemis, planteando críticas sobre su utilidad, costos y efectos políticos o estratégicos, y ofrece una visión crítica respecto a si sus beneficios justifican la inversión.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-programa-artemis-es-un-sinsentido</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-programa-artemis-es-un-sinsentido</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 23:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Juicio por coacciones en la custodia de un menor en Zestoa]]></title><description><![CDATA[El juicio por coacciones en el caso de la custodia de un menor en Zestoa comenzó en la Audiencia de Gipuzkoa.

Durante el proceso, el hombre relató que fue insultado, grabado en video y sometido a diversas presiones para que aceptara las condiciones de su exmujer. El demandante afirmó que los encausados buscaban provocar una reacción violenta de su parte para poder acusarlo de agresividad. Además, destacó que, debido a esta situación, su vida personal se vio gravemente afectada, padeciendo ansiedad y siendo marginado socialmente en su comunidad. A pesar de las protestas de colectivos feministas que defienden a los acusados, el hombre sostiene que la situación fue un acto de acoso para presionarlo a ceder.

Aroca calificó la actitud del PP como un 'ejercicio de trumpismo mesetario', señalando que cuestionar el sistema electoral debido a un robo común es un ataque a los cimientos de la democracia. La Junta Electoral Provincial de Badajoz ya ha confirmado que los 124 electores afectados por el robo podrán votar de nuevo sin que exista alteración en el resultado electoral. El robo, ocurrido en la madrugada del jueves, afectó a una caja fuerte que contenía votos emitidos, pero la investigación apunta a que se trató de un robo común, no con motivaciones políticas. Aunque el PP ha insistido en hablar de 'robo de la democracia' y 'alteración del resultado', la evidencia desmiente estas acusaciones.

Adaptación de la novela de Anthony Burgess, la película aborda temas como la ultraviolencia juvenil, el control social y el libre albedrío de una manera única y provocadora. El uso de la violencia estilizada y un humor macabro, sumado a la inquietante música de Beethoven, hace que la obra siga generando un impacto emocional fuerte incluso medio siglo después de su estreno. Su visión de un joven delincuente sometido a un método de 'curación' que le elimina la capacidad de decidir entre el bien y el mal toca el corazón de una crítica más profunda sobre la sociedad y el control institucional. Además, la película sigue siendo relevante no solo por lo que muestra, sino por la manera en la que obliga al espectador a reflexionar sobre su propio papel frente a la barbarie que se justifica en nombre del orden.

Esta propuesta ha desencadenado una huelga general histórica, con la participación de sindicatos como UGT-Portugal y CGTP-IN y una movilización masiva en Lisboa que, según los organizadores, habría contado con unos tres millones de personas.

Tras el parto, y con el objetivo de ocultar el embarazo, la joven utilizó un cuchillo para degollar a la bebé, quien había nacido viva. La madre ocultó el cuerpo de la niña en un armario, envuelto en toallas y dentro de una bolsa de plástico. Los médicos confirmaron que la bebé falleció a causa de un corte en el cuello. La acusada confesó el crimen para evitar que se descubriera el embarazo, aunque no presentó ninguna alteración psíquica en el momento de cometer el asesinato. La sentencia, dictada tras un acuerdo de conformidad, considera el asesinato como un delito con circunstancias de parentesco, y la condena a la joven ha sido de 23 años de prisión.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/condenada-a-23-anos-por-asesinar-a-su-hija-recien-nacida-tras-ocultar-el-embarazo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/condenada-a-23-anos-por-asesinar-a-su-hija-recien-nacida-tras-ocultar-el-embarazo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 23:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[“He creado un monstruo”.

En lugar de eso, los casos se incluirán en la estadística general que se remite al Ministerio de Sanidad.

Sin embargo, estas donaciones familiares están gravadas por el impuesto de donaciones, lo que hace que el hijo receptor deba pagar impuestos y que el padre deba declarar el incremento patrimonial en su renta. En contraste, las donaciones a entidades sin ánimo de lucro, como ONGs, reciben importantes bonificaciones fiscales. Esta disparidad genera una paradoja: apoyar a hijos directamente resulta más gravoso fiscalmente que contribuir a causas solidarias. José Alberto Marín, decano del Colegio Notarial de Catalunya, explica que cada comunidad autónoma aplica esta fiscalidad de manera distinta, siendo Catalunya especialmente estricta.

El arresto ha provocado que tanto el Partido Republicano del estado como el caucus del Senado pidan su dimisión, considerando la gravedad de los hechos y la necesidad de que se enfoque en su familia. Este incidente coincide con la reciente introducción por parte de Eichorn de un polémico proyecto de ley que proponía clasificar el 'síndrome de Trump' como enfermedad mental, una medida criticada ampliamente por trivializar problemas de salud mental reales y por constituir un ataque a la libertad de expresión.

El Juzgado de Primera Instancia e Instrucción número 1 de Segorbe ha dictado medidas cautelares de alejamiento de los menores y ha prohibido al alcalde comunicarse con ellos. La causa, que se inició hace varios meses, se mantiene bajo secreto de sumario en parte de su tramitación y la respuesta oficial del alcalde ha sido de no hacer declaraciones, remitiéndose a sus abogados.

En los primeros capítulos, Muñoz se lamentaba de que su restaurante se había quedado sin angulas y comentaba que consumía cinco o seis kilos a la semana, lo que generó indignación en el experto. Mario señala que las angulas son la fase joven de la anguila y que se encuentran en peligro crítico de extinción, alertando de que su consumo excesivo podría llevar a la desaparición de la especie. Además, critica que el documental trate este hecho como un tema trivial o incluso como un lujo gastronómico. El biólogo recalca la necesidad de concienciar sobre la conservación de especies y lamenta que prácticas que serían inaceptables con animales como ballenas u orcas se normalicen con las angulas. Aun así, expresa que quiere creer que la conducta del chef se debe a desconocimiento y no a malicia.

Los sindicatos CGT Sanidad Barcelona e Intersindical han presentado una denuncia judicial contra el Consorci Mar Parc de Salut y el Departament de Salut de la Generalitat, señalando un presunto abandono colectivo ilegal de un servicio público. La situación refleja una saturación estructural del servicio, que ese día llegó a tener 170 pacientes para una capacidad de 110 boxes. Entre ellos, 64 superaron las 24 horas de espera, y un paciente llegó a permanecer más de 159 horas en Urgencias. Los sindicatos advierten que las estancias prolongadas en este servicio, no diseñado para cuidados prolongados, incrementan el riesgo de mortalidad y empeoran los resultados clínicos, especialmente entre personas mayores o vulnerables.

Al acercarse a saludarle, Meloni mostró una expresión de sorpresa y, al estrecharle la mano, se rió, generando gran atención en redes sociales. El encuentro tuvo lugar en el Palacio Chigi de Roma y su objetivo principal era abordar diversas iniciativas bilaterales incluidas en el Plan Mattei, que busca fortalecer la cooperación entre Italia y Mozambique. Entre los temas tratados destacan el acceso a la energía, la agricultura sostenible, la formación profesional, la digitalización y el fortalecimiento de los servicios de salud.

La paciente, una mujer de 54 años sin antecedentes relevantes, sufrió un dolor abdominal persistente y, tras varias consultas y pruebas, la ecografía quedó programada pero se demoró más de cuatro meses. Este retraso se consideró excesivo e inaceptable y se calificó como una disfunción del sistema público de salud, afectando la oportunidad de diagnóstico y, en consecuencia, de posibles tratamientos. Aunque el diagnóstico definitivo de cáncer de páncreas llegó tras acudir a un centro privado, el TSJM aplicó la doctrina de la pérdida de oportunidad para indemnizar a la familia, concluyendo que la demora privó a la paciente de una oportunidad razonable de tratamiento en una etapa más favorable de la enfermedad.

El alto tribunal considera que los artículos constituyen una intromisión ilegítima en el derecho al honor de Iglesias y, por ello, condena solidariamente a Inda y a Dos Mil Palabras a pagar 18.000 euros de indemnización. Aunque se reconoce que la información no fue veraz y no se basó en datos contrastados de fuentes fiables, la sentencia no acoge la petición de disculpas públicas de manera específica.

Los expertos atribuyen esta situación a décadas de planificación hidráulica deficiente, incluyendo la construcción masiva de presas ineficaces y la sobreexplotación de acuíferos subterráneos mediante pozos profundos. Este proceso ha destruido gran parte de los antiguos qanats, sistemas de túneles milenarios diseñados para extraer agua subterránea de forma sostenible. La combinación de sequías extremas, cambio climático y políticas hidráulicas erróneas ha reducido drásticamente los niveles de agua en ríos, lagos y humedales, provocando la desertificación de regiones clave. La agricultura consume aproximadamente el 90% del agua disponible, mientras que la sobreexplotación de pozos ha vaciado los acuíferos y disminuido la eficiencia de los sistemas tradicionales de captación. Como resultado, Irán considera trasladar su capital a regiones costeras más húmedas, un proyecto costoso y d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-hidrica-en-iran-agotamiento-de-acuiferos-y-abandono-de-los-qanats</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-hidrica-en-iran-agotamiento-de-acuiferos-y-abandono-de-los-qanats</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Denuncia de agresión sexual continuada por parte de Adolfo Suárez en los años 80, ocurrida cuando la denunciante era menor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una denuncia presentada ante la Unidad policial especializada de Atención a la Familia y Mujer de Madrid acusa a Adolfo Suárez González, ya fallecido, de haber cometido agresiones sexuales continuadas entre 1982 y 1985 contra una menor de 17 años que admiraba al entonces líder político.

A pesar de sus esfuerzos, la Comisión Europea, liderada por Ursula von der Leyen, ha presentado un paquete de medidas que flexibiliza la prohibición total de coches de combustión prevista para 2035, permitiendo que se produzcan coches híbridos y de motor diésel o gasolina que representen hasta el 10% de las emisiones actuales, siempre que implementen medidas compensatorias, como la fabricación de vehículos eléctricos pequeños o el uso de materiales con menor huella de carbono. Además, en materia de vivienda, las recomendaciones de Bruselas se centran en acelerar los permisos de construcción y reducir impuestos sobre la propiedad, sin abordar la regulación de la especulación inmobiliaria que Sánchez había solicitado.

El contrato, valorado en 195 millones de euros para dos años, ha generado críticas de la Asociación Galega para a Defensa da Sanidade Pública (AGDSP), que denuncia que se priorizan los beneficios privados sobre la cobertura y calidad de la atención sanitaria. Povisa ha recibido pagos por actividad y por habitante, incluso con una reducción de pacientes atendidos y la eliminación de servicios clave como neurocirugía, electrofisiología y atención a grandes quemados, que ahora se derivan al Hospital Universitario de A Coruña. Mientras la Xunta defiende que el modelo cumple las recomendaciones del Consello de Contas, la AGDSP advierte que se trata de un traslado de fondos públicos a una multinacional, sin garantías de reinversión ni fiscalización efectiva.

Smith indicó que además se han reunido evidencias de que Trump incumplió la ley al almacenar documentos clasificados de su primer mandato en su residencia de Mar-a-Lago, en Florida, y al obstruir los esfuerzos del gobierno para recuperarlos. Durante la entrevista a puerta cerrada, Smith subrayó que sus decisiones en la investigación no se vieron influenciadas por consideraciones políticas, creencias personales ni la candidatura de Trump en las elecciones de 2024.

Asimismo, Wiles criticó a la fiscal general Pam Bondi por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein, cuestionando la distribución de información incompleta a influenciadores conservadores.

Según la investigación, las primeras quejas se remontan a abril y no obtuvieron respuesta, llevando a González a enviar un correo el 1 de diciembre a Guardiola y otros dirigentes para denunciar las repetidas actitudes despectivas y el acoso. El documento obtenido por el medio contiene expresiones como “Aguanta” y “Ya sabes cómo es Enrique”, indicios de una respuesta contemplada como dilatoria por parte de la estructura del PP.

Las críticas del presidente, que apuntaban a la supuesta obsesión de Reiner contra Trump, generaron una oleada de reacciones en distintos sectores, incluyendo figuras del mundo del entretenimiento y algunos políticos. Freeman sostiene que el mandatario “no lideró con humanidad ni moderación” y que, en lugar de empatía, utilizó el dolor de las familias para atacar a sus críticos.

Si se tiene en cuenta el impacto por valor contractual, la cantidad podría ascender a 10.558,5 millones de euros en casos abiertos vinculados al PP. En contraste, los casos asociados al PSOE o al Gobierno suman 188,5 millones en perjuicio penal y 546,4 millones en impacto contractual, con un agregado total aproximado de 734,9 millones bajo análisis.

Comienza explicando la creación del esperanto por Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof en 1887 como una lengua internacional destinada a fomentar la comprensión entre los pueblos. En España, el idioma se difundió rápidamente entre docentes, militares y colectivos progresistas. En Zamora, el esperantismo llegó en 1908 de la mano del teniente coronel Eugenio Calvo Blasco, quien impulsó la formación de un grupo local muy activo, con una sección femenina que destacó por su entusiasmo y participación. El grupo realizó cursos gratuitos, conferencias, veladas culturales y actuaciones musicales en el Café Español, convirtiéndose en un ejemplo de dinamismo social e interés intelectual. Sin embargo, tras unos años de intensa actividad, la sociedad se disolvió en 1909 por falta de apoyo institucional y cambios entre sus dirigentes.

Assange argumenta que Machado ha incitado públicamente a la Administración estadounidense a intervenir militarmente en Venezuela, e incluso a justificar ataques contra barcos civiles frente a sus costas, lo que, a su juicio, la hace inelegible para recibir un galardón destinado a promover la fraternidad entre naciones, conforme al testamento de Alfred Nobel.

El juez instructor, Adolfo Carretero, había propuesto previamente juzgar a Errejón, al entender que había indicios de un antiguo delito de abuso sexual —figura que existía antes de la reforma de la ley del 'solo sí es sí'—, al no mediar violencia ni intimidación.

La magnitud de las precipitaciones ha provocado el colapso parcial del sistema de alcantarillado, que se ha visto incapaz de absorber el gran volumen de agua en tan poco tiempo, lo que ha derivado en anegamientos de la calzada y problemas de tráfico en la zona. Muchas de las vías adyacentes también se han visto afectadas, dificultando la circulación y generando retenciones en las horas punta. Según testigos y vecinos de la zona, el agua ha alcanzado niveles que superan el bordillo en algunos puntos, lo que ha obligado a varios conductores a detener sus vehículos o buscar rutas alternativas.

Según la fundación, la representación resultaba «grosera e insultante» por el uso de elementos modernos como gafas de sol en figuras identificables con la Virgen María y otros personajes religiosos.

En su respuesta, Santas Pascuas defiende el cartel como una reinterpretación artística libre y contextualizada dentro de la escenografía musical actual.

Su Ejecutivo impulsó reformas que transformaron profundamente el mercado laboral y el sistema fiscal, al tiempo que recortaba el gasto en servicios públicos. Entre las actuaciones más relevantes se incluyen la subida del IVA en 2012 del 18% al 21%, la reducción de la indemnización por despido, y una reforma laboral que generó un notable aumento del empleo temporal y precario. En el ámbito social, las pensiones solo se incrementaron un 0,25% anual durante varios años, lo que supuso una pérdida del poder adquisitivo de los jubilados. Además, se redujeron las prestaciones por desempleo y se introdujeron copagos farmacéuticos y recortes en educación y sanidad.

La compañía china ha presentado nuevas patentes sobre motores síncronos de imanes permanentes de flujo variable (VF-PMSM), un tipo de propulsor que podría revolucionar la eficiencia de los vehículos eléctricos y de los híbridos enchufables. A diferencia de los motores con flujo de rotor fijo, tradicionales en la mayoría de los coches eléctricos actuales, esta nueva tecnología permite ajustar dinámicamente el flujo magnético interno del rotor dependiendo de las condiciones de conducción.

Gracias a este sistema, el motor es capaz de ofrecer un par motor elevado a bajas velocidades y mantener alta eficiencia cuando el vehículo circula rápido, algo que hasta ahora suponía una pérdida considerable de energía.

Según el trabajo, el temor a perder la vivienda, el barrio y las redes sociales que conforman la vida cotidiana genera una sensación de inseguridad y desarraigo que empuja a muchos ciudadanos a apoyar opciones políticas populistas y contrarias al establishment. El factor determinante no es tanto la imposibilidad de pagar el alquiler como el miedo al desplazamiento y al cambio del entorno: la gentrificación, la llegada de residentes con más dinero y la transformación del tejido urbano.

Conocidas como los Colosos de Memnón, estas esculturas monumentales datan de hace unos 3.400 años y formaban parte del templo funerario del faraón, situado en la orilla occidental del Nilo.

El proyecto de restauración ha requerido cerca de dos décadas de trabajo y ha supuesto un complejo proceso de documentación, consolidación y reensamblaje de miles de fragmentos dispersos. Las estatuas, que habían sufrido graves daños a lo largo de los siglos debido a terremotos, erosión y expolio, vuelven ahora a mostrarse con una apariencia más cercana a la original, alcanzando varios metros de altura y un peso considerable.

Según el Comando Sur estadounidense, las embarcaciones pertenecían a organizaciones consideradas terroristas y transitaban por rutas marítimas conocidas por el tráfico de drogas. La acción se realizó bajo las órdenes del secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth. Desde septiembre, el Pentágono ha hundido más de 25 embarcaciones similares en el Caribe y el Pacífico, con un saldo de al menos 95 muertos. Estas operaciones forman parte de una ofensiva impulsada por la Administración de Donald Trump, que ha aumentado su presencia militar en el Caribe para combatir el narcotráfico, aunque Venezuela acusa a Washington de intentar desestabilizar su gobierno bajo ese pretexto.

La decisión llega tras un período de dos años, iniciado en enero de 2024, durante el cual se evaluó la viabilidad y la factibilidad de la iniciativa. El anuncio se realizó en una rueda de prensa celebrada en el museo bilbaíno, después de la reunión del Patronato presidida por el lehendakari, Imanol Pradales. En dicho encuentro participaron también la diputada general de Bizkaia, Elixabete Etxanobe; la vicelehendakari y consejera de Cultura y Política Lingüística, Ibone Bengoetxea, y la directora del Guggenheim Bilbao, Miren Arzalluz. 

El proyecto, conocido como Guggenheim Urdaibai, contemplaba la creación de dos sedes adicionales del museo: una en Gernika y otra en Murueta, unidas por una pasarela sobre la ría.

Dos empresarios de Puerto Lumbreras están siendo investigados como presuntos responsables de la sustracción de al menos 50 millones de litros de agua, obtenidos de un pozo clandestino sin permisos ni dispositivos de medición. Según las pesquisas del SEPRONA, la empresa implicada habría comercializado el agua con explotaciones ganaderas, empresas y particulares, llegando a facturar cerca de 275.000 euros en los últimos 18 meses. La investigación se inició tras la denuncia de 128 vecinos de la diputación de Zarzalico (Lorca), que alertaron de irregularidades en el suministro de agua a granjas locales. A raíz de estas denuncias, la Guardia Civil detectó un punto de llenado de camiones cisterna en una finca de Puerto Lumbreras y comprobó que el agua extraída se destinaba a explotaciones porcinas, v]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dos-empresarios-de-murcia-investigados-por-extraer-y-vender-agua-de-un-pozo-sin-autorizacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dos-empresarios-de-murcia-investigados-por-extraer-y-vender-agua-de-un-pozo-sin-autorizacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 08:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El CICUS propone un espacio colectivo para repensar la fiesta como herramienta cultural y política]]></title><description><![CDATA[El proyecto 'Pensar la Fiesta', impulsado por el Laboratorio de Investigaciones Contemporáneas del CICUS y coordinado por Manuel Zapata, busca explorar la fiesta no solo como un fenómeno social, sino como una práctica política, poética y emocional.

Su postura crítica hacia la corrupción institucional y su trabajo en la defensa de causas de transparencia y justicia le habrían acarreado represalias, aislamiento profesional y una especie de exilio mediático y judicial. El artículo describe cómo, tras denunciar abusos y malas prácticas en ámbitos del poder, fue objeto de procesos y acosos que intentaron silenciarlo, lo que simboliza el alto precio que a menudo pagan los alertadores o denunciantes de corrupción en el país. Actualmente, Sánchez del Águila se encuentra impulsando una campaña de apoyo y solidaridad hacia los hermanos Galindo, presuntas víctimas de injusticias institucionales y judiciales.

Por un lado, la versión clásica de Joan Pous i Porta y Josep Maria Solé i Sabaté, en su obra *Anarquia i República* (1988), sostiene que la violencia en la comarca fue promovida exclusivamente por la CNT-FAI y su líder Antonio Martín, «El Cojo de Málaga». Esta visión, cercana al nacionalismo catalán institucional, presentó a los anarquistas como agentes del caos y a las fuerzas republicanas y catalanistas como defensores del orden. Por otro lado, la revisión de Antonio Gascón y Agustín Guillamón en *Nacionalistas contra anarquistas en la Cerdaña (1936-1937)* (2018) desmantela esa lectura a través de un extenso trabajo documental basado en archivos franceses, actas municipales, informes judiciales y listas de milicianos.

Vito Quiles esperó a Santaolalla a la salida de un establecimiento con la intención de provocarla sobre su salario en TVE, lanzándole frases despectivas que insinuaban que su posición profesional dependía de su pareja, el periodista Javier Ruiz. Ante su intento de mantener una conversación, la periodista respondió con firmeza, recordándole que su trayectoria era previa a esa relación y que no debía su carrera a ningún hombre.

Según el auto judicial, Urbano habría mantenido una relación personal e íntima con la mujer, a quien también habría pagado 21.000 euros en concepto de alquiler de una vivienda en Estepona entre enero de 2022 y enero de 2023.

El 10 % restante podrá compensarse mediante créditos medioambientales obtenidos por el uso de materiales y combustibles más sostenibles, como el acero de bajas emisiones, los biocombustibles o los e-fuels. Además, el objetivo intermedio para 2030 se rebaja: los coches deberán reducir sus emisiones en un 55 %, y las furgonetas en un 40 %.

Epstein la llevó en su primera cita a recorrer Manhattan en un Rolls-Royce, lo que impresionó a Obregón, aunque ella aseguró posteriormente que solo quiso mantener una amistad con él. En sus memorias de 2012, Obregón describió a Epstein como 'el hombre perfecto del que nunca me enamoré'. Durante esa época, Epstein mantenía una relación sentimental con la modelo sueca Eva Andersson, pero no dejó de acercarse a otras mujeres influyentes o con recursos económicos.

La acusada convivía habitualmente con los niños desde su nacimiento debido a las circunstancias familiares y laborales de la madre de los menores. Según la sentencia, la mujer aprovechó esa situación de confianza y cercanía para cometer los abusos en su vivienda y en otros lugares, donde llegó a realizar tocamientos y actos de naturaleza sexual. En un episodio especialmente grave ocurrido en verano de 2019, se determinó que la acusada obligó a los menores a mantener relaciones sexuales en una playa, repitiendo la conducta con cada uno de ellos.

Inspirándose en pensadores como Bertrand Russell y en su propio libro 'Metafísica de la pereza', Valls Boix defiende el valor de no hacer nada como modo de recuperar la libertad y la capacidad crítica. Considera que la pereza no es un defecto moral, sino una forma de desobediencia que permite escapar del ritmo acelerado y competitivo del capitalismo tardío. Según él, cuando la sociedad impone la actividad constante, detenerse se convierte en un gesto de rebeldía y amor: una forma de descolonizar el tiempo y darse permiso para existir fuera de la utilidad.

El piso, heredado junto a su hermana, se alquilaba por 600 euros al mes, un precio inferior al del mercado, para facilitar el acceso a la vivienda. Sin embargo, los impagos comenzaron en junio de 2023, coincidiendo con la entrada en vigor de la nueva Ley estatal de Vivienda, que refuerza la protección a las familias vulnerables ante posibles desahucios. 

Tras un proceso judicial, el desahucio fue suspendido en febrero de 2024 al determinarse la vulnerabilidad de la arrendataria.

El fallo se produjo cuando su hija, ahora mayor de edad, confesó durante el juicio oral que su declaración original había sido falsa y que fue inducida a mentir por su madre y su abuela materna. La denuncia, presentada en 2018 por la entonces pareja de Godoy, sostenía que los abusos ocurrieron cuando la niña tenía entre siete y diez años. En aquella época, el acusado obtuvo una exención de prisión, aunque su vida personal y profesional se vio afectada durante el extenso proceso judicial. Inicialmente, la Cámara de Apelaciones había considerado que no existían pruebas sólidas y dispuso el sobreseimiento, pero el Tribunal de Casación ordenó continuar con la causa hasta juicio oral.

Según el autor, la empresa utiliza la publicidad para promover una visión edulcorada de la reconciliación nacional, similar a la de la Transición española, en un envoltorio aparentemente emocional y festivo. Martínez Pereda acusa a Campofrío de apropiarse de problemas culturales y políticos reales —como la polarización social— para transformarlos en un relato comercial con connotaciones patrióticas y nostálgicas. El texto denuncia que esta estrategia convierte cuestiones históricas complejas en productos publicitarios fácilmente consumibles, despojados de conflicto o análisis crítico. Esta ‘operación cultural’, como la denomina el autor, encubre un discurso político disfrazado de neutralidad, que sugiere una falsa simetría entre quienes provocan los enfrentamientos ideológicos y quienes simplemente]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-al-mensaje-ideologico-del-anuncio-navideno-de-campofrio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-al-mensaje-ideologico-del-anuncio-navideno-de-campofrio</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 21:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG integra Microsoft Copilot en sus Smart TV sin opción de desinstalarlo y reabre el debate sobre el control del usuario]]></title><description><![CDATA[Usuarios de televisores inteligentes de LG han denunciado en los últimos días la aparición de una nueva aplicación en la pantalla principal de webOS: Microsoft Copilot. Esta aplicación se ha instalado automáticamente tras una actualización de software y no puede desinstalarse, algo que ha generado una fuerte reacción negativa. Aunque el icono puede ocultarse, la aplicación permanece activa en el sistema, lo que muchos consideran una pérdida clara de control sobre un dispositivo que han comprado.

El caso se enmarca en una tendencia más amplia del sector tecnológico: fabricantes y grandes plataformas añaden funciones, servicios o accesos directos sin el consentimiento explícito del usuario. En este caso, LG y Microsoft materializan una colaboración anunciada previamente en el CES 2025, donde se presentó la estrategia de 'AI TV' de LG, con Copilot como asistente capaz de responder preguntas y recomendar contenidos.

Los testimonios señalan que durante años se habrían producido comportamientos de carácter machista, homófobo y xenófobo dentro de las estructuras juveniles y del propio partido. Entre las acusaciones destacan presiones físicas, comentarios vejatorios, espionaje interno y propuestas de favores sexuales a cambio de información o beneficios políticos. Algunos jóvenes llegaron a requerir tratamiento psiquiátrico por las consecuencias psicológicas del acoso sufrido. Los denunciantes aseguran que, pese a la gravedad de los hechos, el Comité de Derechos y Garantías del PP decidió archivar internamente el expediente sin trasladarlo a la Fiscalía, alegando falta de pruebas. Además, sostienen que no recibieron respuesta formal ni acompañamiento institucional, acusando al proceso de ser opaco y despectivo.

La decisión se fundamenta en una combinación de factores económicos y geopolíticos: una caída sostenida de la demanda en mercados clave como China y Europa, el impacto de las tensiones comerciales internacionales, y la necesidad de adaptar su capacidad productiva al contexto actual del sector. El mercado chino, históricamente un motor de crecimiento para Volkswagen, ha reducido su ritmo debido a una mayor competencia local y a la ralentización económica. A ello se suman los aranceles impuestos por Estados Unidos, que han encarecido la exportación de vehículos y forzado una revisión profunda de la estrategia global del grupo.

La iniciativa se produce tras el anuncio de la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER) de mantener a Israel en la competición, lo que ha generado un fuerte rechazo en Portugal y otros países europeos. Salvador Sobral, ganador de Eurovisión 2017, ha sido una de las voces más destacadas del movimiento, pidiendo a la cadena pública RTP que retire la participación portuguesa como gesto de coherencia moral y política. Sobral considera que, al permitir la presencia de Israel, el festival se hace cómplice de un genocidio contra el pueblo palestino y refleja una doble moral por parte de la organización.

En ese acto, Ayuso se preguntó cómo se les puede explicar a los jóvenes que deben 'trabajar fuerte' cuando el PP llegue al Gobierno de España, una afirmación que fue interpretada por muchos como un reproche implícito a la actitud laboral de la juventud.

Las palabras de Ayuso no tardaron en viralizarse en redes sociales, donde numerosos usuarios las resumieron con ironía como un aviso de lo que vendría en caso de un cambio de Gobierno. Comentarios sarcásticos, memes y críticas inundaron plataformas como X (antes Twitter), cuestionando si la dirigente popular estaba sugiriendo que los jóvenes no se esfuerzan lo suficiente o si, por el contrario, estaba preparando el terreno para políticas laborales más duras.

En su discurso, Anguita insta a los ciudadanos a no votar jamás a un político corrupto, sin importar el símbolo o partido al que pertenezca, apelando a la inteligencia y la ética del electorado. Su frase más citada, 'Al ladrón no lo votéis, aunque tenga la hoz y el martillo', pretende recordar que la honestidad y la coherencia deben estar por encima de las etiquetas partidistas. 

Julio Anguita González (1941–2020) fue uno de los líderes más influyentes de la izquierda española en las décadas de 1980 y 1990. Fue alcalde de Córdoba entre 1979 y 1986, convirtiéndose en el primer regidor comunista desde la Guerra Civil.

Estos sistemas se basan en principios de termodinámica y diseño bioclimático, utilizando materiales locales como el adobe y recursos naturales como la sombra, la ventilación y el enfriamiento radiativo para conservar alimentos y mantener bajas temperaturas.

Según los expertos en ciberseguridad, colgar inmediatamente cuando se recibe una llamada de un número desconocido puede ser contraproducente. Esto se debe a que muchos sistemas automáticos de marcado, impulsados por algoritmos de inteligencia artificial, utilizan la respuesta o falta de ella para determinar si un número está activo. Cuando una persona cuelga sin decir nada, el sistema interpreta que ese número simplemente no estaba disponible en ese momento, por lo que volverá a intentarlo más adelante. En cambio, si se contesta y se da una respuesta breve y directa como 'no estoy interesado', el sistema suele registrar el número como inactivo o no viable para futuras llamadas comerciales, reduciendo así la probabilidad de que se repita el contacto.

La investigación, que analizó proyecciones en 80 países con baja fecundidad, señala que en 13 de ellos —principalmente de Europa oriental y sudoriental, como Bulgaria, Letonia, Rumanía y Hungría— la reducción de la mortalidad tendría un efecto mucho más significativo que un aumento de la natalidad. Según las estimaciones, si estos países no toman ninguna medida, perderían unos 33,8 millones de habitantes de aquí a 2050.

El monarca emérito afrontaba tres causas abiertas por la Fiscalía del Tribunal Supremo: una por una presunta comisión saudí de 65 millones de euros relacionada con el AVE a La Meca, otra por diez millones guardados en un ‘trust’ en Jersey y una tercera por los viajes que le pagó la Fundación Zagatka, gestionada por su primo Álvaro de Orleans. En total, el rey regularizó más de cinco millones de euros mediante dos pagos al fisco, realizados antes de una notificación formal de acusación, lo que permitió acogerse al artículo 305.4 del Código Penal y considerar su situación “regularizada”.

Primero, un tiroteo en la Universidad de Brown dejó dos muertos y nueve heridos; la respuesta presidencial fue considerada insensible, minimizando el incidente con un comentario de 'cosas que pasan' y anunciando la detención de un sospechoso que luego resultó no ser cierto. Posteriormente, la noticia del asesinato del director de cine Rob Reiner y su esposa por su hijo recibió una respuesta igualmente polémica, en la que el presidente ridiculizó indirectamente al fallecido, generando críticas sobre su falta de empatía y moralidad. Senserrich destaca que este comportamiento refleja un patrón de cinismo y ausencia de filtro ético, distinto al de anteriores presidentes que aunque tuviesen defectos, solían mantener cierta prudencia pública. Además, se mencionan otros aspectos del contexto político actual, como la parálisis de la agencia NLRB, la influencia de Trump en legislac]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-respuesta-del-presidente-de-ee-uu-ante-tragedias-recientes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-respuesta-del-presidente-de-ee-uu-ante-tragedias-recientes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 12:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China y la UE negocian un sistema de precios mínimos para los coches eléctricos chinos en Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[China y la Unión Europea han retomado las negociaciones para sustituir los actuales aranceles a los coches eléctricos fabricados en China por un sistema de precios mínimos en el mercado europeo. El objetivo de esta fórmula sería permitir la entrada de vehículos chinos sin penalizaciones arancelarias adicionales, pero estableciendo un suelo de precios que proteja a los fabricantes europeos frente a una competencia considerada desleal.

El origen del conflicto se remonta a octubre de 2024, cuando la UE aprobó aranceles de hasta el 45,3% tras una investigación de la Comisión Europea que concluía que los fabricantes chinos se beneficiaban de subvenciones públicas que distorsionaban el mercado. Según Bruselas, estas ayudas podían generar un exceso de oferta y poner en riesgo a la industria automovilística europea.

Ayuso aseguró que muchas personas mayores le advierten del creciente 'guerracivilismo' y pidió a los asistentes que no caigan en divisiones políticas. Criticó al Ejecutivo al que calificó de 'mafia', acusándolo de fomentar enfrentamientos y de imponer discursos vacíos. Además, defendió los valores occidentales, que identificó con el catolicismo, y reivindicó el papel histórico de España como portadora de 'civilización y derechos humanos'. También volvió a cargar contra el País Vasco y Cataluña, calificando a sus administraciones de 'mafiosas' y de promover una 'compra masiva de sentimientos'.

La escritora colombiana Laura Restrepo, ganadora del Premio Alfaguara 2004, fue la primera en anunciar su decisión mediante una carta pública dirigida a la organización. En su comunicado, Restrepo expresó que no podía compartir escenario con una figura que, a su juicio, apoya posturas intervencionistas de Estados Unidos en América Latina. Poco después, el novelista barranquillero Giuseppe Caputo y la activista dominicana Mikaelah Drullard también cancelaron su participación, argumentando razones similares y criticando el papel de Machado en contextos de violencia e intervencionismo militar en la región.

Según el fallo, no se ha producido una 'nueva situación' que justifique reiniciar el procedimiento, ya que los hechos recientes están vinculados al conflicto armado y a la ocupación que se investigan desde 2021, tras una solicitud formal presentada por Palestina en 2018. Israel había argumentado que la magnitud de los acontecimientos posteriores al 7 de octubre y las acusaciones de genocidio requerían una nueva notificación a los Estados, lo que habría permitido activar su jurisdicción nacional y suspender la actuación de la CPI.

Esto significa que una persona con un sueldo intermedio tendría que trabajar más de un siglo para igualar lo que un máximo directivo percibe en un solo año. La desigualdad es especialmente marcada en empresas como Prosegur, Inditex y CIE Automotive, donde las diferencias superan las 300 veces. Aunque las grandes corporaciones pagan de media un 63% más que la media nacional, en su interior las distancias entre los salarios más altos y los más bajos son mucho más significativas. Además, el informe destaca que la mitad de los trabajadores asalariados en España gana, como máximo, una vez y media el salario mínimo, alrededor de 24.000 euros al año, lo que se traduce en dificultades reales para mantener un nivel de vida digno ante la inflación y los altos pre]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oxfam-alerta-de-la-enorme-brecha-salarial-y-de-genero-en-las-grandes-empresas-espanolas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oxfam-alerta-de-la-enorme-brecha-salarial-y-de-genero-en-las-grandes-empresas-espanolas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los bosques españoles actuales: ecosistemas creados por la intervención humana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los bosques actuales en España no son reflejo de una naturaleza original intacta, sino el resultado de siglos de intervención humana y políticas de gestión forestal.

La gran mayoría de los bosques modernos son cultivos planificados, con predominancia de pinos por su rápido crecimiento y resistencia, aunque también se han plantado otras especies como secuoyas, robles americanos o ginkgos. Este proceso ha respondido a necesidades económicas, culturales y de gestión del territorio, y ha generado bosques con valor estético y social recientes.

Aunque los aranceles pretendían limitar la competencia desleal causada por los subsidios estatales chinos, los fabricantes asiáticos han sabido adaptarse centrando su estrategia en modelos con motores térmicos, híbridos autorrecargables e híbridos enchufables, que solo pagan el arancel estándar del 10 %. De este modo, dos tercios de los vehículos chinos vendidos en Europa evitan el gravamen punitivo.

Estos nuevos modelos europeos, denominados provisionalmente 'E-Cars', se situarán entre los cuadriciclos ligeros como el Citroën Ami y los turismos convencionales.

El trabajo identifica un mecanismo que conecta el ciclo circadiano de 24 horas con la reparación de roturas de ADN en células humanas, proceso clave para mantener la estabilidad genómica y prevenir la aparición de tumores. La investigación se centra en la proteína circadiana Cryptochrome1 (CRY1), componente esencial del reloj biológico, cuya cantidad oscila de forma natural a lo largo del ciclo día‑noche y modula directamente la actividad de reparación del ADN.

Además, la gestión pública y sanitaria de algunas comunidades autónomas ha sido cuestionada por intereses privados y privatizaciones. La justicia, a veces, actúa favoreciendo a ciertos sectores políticos, mientras que el acoso hacia las mujeres refleja persistentes estructuras patriarcales.

El corte coincidía exactamente con un debate en plató sobre la polarización política en España, en el que Máximo Huerta acusó directamente a Ana Rosa Quintana de contribuir a esa polarización a través de sus editoriales y análisis diarios.

El momento suprimido se producía después de un reportaje basado en un estudio de El País que señalaba que un 14 % de los españoles ha roto relaciones personales en el último año por discusiones políticas, una situación que se intensifica durante las reuniones familiares navideñas. Tras la pieza, el copresentador Jano Mecha apuntó que la polarización era evidente incluso entre los colaboradores del programa, lo que dio pie a la intervención de Huerta, que señaló a Quintana como la principal responsable de ese clima en el plató.

La decisión se basa en que el mensaje enviado por Sánchez al entonces presidente de la Generalitat, Carlos Mazón, a las 22:50 horas del 29 de octubre de 2024, se produjo mucho después de los momentos críticos de la emergencia, cuando ya se había enviado el aviso Es-Alert a los móviles de la ciudadanía y la mayoría de las 230 víctimas mortales ya había fallecido. Según la magistrada, la prueba pretendía un análisis a posteriori y no se ajusta al objeto de la investigación. Además, no consta que Sánchez, a diferencia de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, estuviera informado en tiempo real por Mazón sobre la evolución del temporal. Por otro lado, la jueza ha citado a Feijóo para que explique sus conversaciones con Mazón y le ha ofrecido la posibilidad de presentar sus registros de llamadas y mensajes del día del temporal.

El pesticida, fabricado por Syngenta (subsidiaria de una empresa estatal china) y anteriormente distribuido por Chevron, se utiliza en cultivos de algodón, soja y maíz por su eficacia al eliminar malas hierbas, pero su toxicidad ha generado miles de demandas judiciales. Ex trabajadores agrícolas, como Paul Friday en Míchigan o Jim Krause en California, afirman que el contacto prolongado con el químico dañó sus células nerviosas y desencadenó su enfermedad. Más de 6.000 casos judiciales están acumulados en los tribunales estadounidenses, y aunque Syngenta niega que exista una relación causal entre el paraquat y el párkinson, investigaciones científicas señalan un aumento del riesgo de contraer la enfermedad entre quienes viven o tra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-herbicida-paraquat-en-ee-uu-se-vincula-con-un-aumento-de-casos-de-parkinson-entre-agricultores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-herbicida-paraquat-en-ee-uu-se-vincula-con-un-aumento-de-casos-de-parkinson-entre-agricultores</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 03:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Cuenca completa la retirada de símbolos franquistas pendientes desde 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Cuenca ha culminado la retirada de más de medio centenar de placas con simbología franquista de diferentes fachadas de la ciudad, poniendo fin a un largo proceso iniciado hace más de una década. Esta actuación da cumplimiento a la Ley de Memoria Democrática y a un acuerdo plenario aprobado en 2018 que establecía la eliminación de los símbolos vinculados a la dictadura franquista. El acuerdo, promovido entonces por Izquierda Unida, PSOE y Ciudadanos —y aprobado pese al voto en contra del Partido Popular—, fijaba un plazo para la retirada de las cerca de 140 placas identificadas, permitiendo la ejecución subsidiaria en caso de incumplimiento. 

Tras varios años de retraso, el actual equipo de gobierno socialista, encabezado por el alcalde Darío Dolz, ha contratado a una empresa para completar la supresión de estos elementos.

A pesar de que sus denuncias fueron archivadas, Serrano se enfrenta actualmente a un juicio militar por presunta denuncia falsa. La Fiscalía no aprecia indicios de delito y, por ello, no ejercerá la acusación. No obstante, existe una acusación particular presentada por el general Fernando Mora Moret, exjefe de la Comandancia de Sevilla, que solicita más de un año de prisión para la suboficial. Durante la vista celebrada en el Tribunal Militar Territorial Primero de Madrid, se declaró la acusada junto al denunciante y dos testigos, quienes no confirmaron que la denuncia inicial de Serrano fuera falsa.

La decisión, tomada en una vista a puerta cerrada, responde a una petición de la Fiscalía General rusa presentada en noviembre de 2025. Según las autoridades, el colectivo supone una amenaza a la seguridad del Estado, acusación que sus miembros y abogados califican como infundada y motivada políticamente. Pussy Riot, conocidas por su activismo feminista y sus críticas al Kremlin, se convirtieron en símbolo de la oposición política y artística al presidente Vladímir Putin desde su célebre “oración punk” en 2012 dentro de la catedral de Cristo Salvador de Moscú, acto por el que dos de sus integrantes fueron encarceladas.

En el primer caso, el presidente minimizó la tragedia —que dejó dos muertos y nueve heridos— con un comentario que transmitía indiferencia ante la violencia armada que asola al país. En el segundo, tras conocerse el asesinato de Reiner, Trump publicó un mensaje que ridiculizaba al fallecido y hacía burla de su postura crítica hacia él, llegando incluso a referirse a él como un “hombre enfermo” afectado por un supuesto “síndrome de demencia trumpiana”.

China ocupa el primer puesto en 66 de ellas, destacando en áreas como la energía nuclear, la biología sintética y los pequeños satélites. Por su parte, Estados Unidos lidera en las ocho restantes, entre las que se encuentran la computación cuántica y la geoingeniería.

El Gobierno regional, presidido por Isabel Díaz Ayuso, justifica este aumento por el crecimiento demográfico —en torno a 100.000 habitantes nuevos al año— y la necesidad de reforzar servicios públicos esenciales. Sanidad absorberá cerca del 36 % del gasto total, con 550 millones más destinados a modernizar hospitales como La Paz o el Gregorio Marañón, y a atender el incremento de recetas médicas, que sube un 17 %. Educación también experimenta una subida de 259 millones y Familia, Juventud y Asuntos Sociales, de 210 millones adicionales. En cambio, Cultura, Turismo y Deporte bajan un 0,8 %, alcanzando los 300,1 millones, lo que representa el segundo recorte consecutivo.

Tras el éxito de Deliverance, Boorman gozó de libertad creativa, escribiendo el guion junto a Bill Stair e inspirándose en T. S. Eliot, leyendas artúricas y autores de ciencia ficción como Jack Vance. La historia transcurre en 2293, en una Tierra postapocalíptica donde conviven los Eternos, inmortales en un paraje idílico, y los Brutales, habitantes de las Tierras Exteriores. Zed, interpretado por Sean Connery, es un Exterminador que penetra en el Vórtice y desestabiliza la paz de los Eternos, explorando temas como eugenesia, libertad versus seguridad, intelectualismo frente a barbarie y religiosidad.

Según relata, los propietarios del edificio intentan forzar su salida mediante obras ruidosas, cortes de luz y una convivencia insoportable con las reformas constantes que buscan transformar el inmueble en varios microapartamentos para turistas. María es una de las tres últimas inquilinas con contrato de renta antigua que quedan en su bloque, y asegura que no se marchará porque no tiene a dónde ir.

A bordo viajaban los cosmonautas Serguéi Ryzhikov (comandante) y Alexéi Zubritsky, junto al astronauta estadounidense Jonathan Kim. El descenso se completó a las 05:03 UTC, tras una maniobra de frenado de 4 minutos y 42 segundos que redujo la velocidad de la nave en 128 m/s. La cápsula alcanzó tierra firme cerca de Dzhezkazgán, desde donde la tripulación fue trasladada por las autoridades espaciales rusas y estadounidenses a sus respectivos centros de recuperación. Ryzhikov, con 603 días acumulados en el espacio tras tres misiones, se sitúa entre los astronautas más experimentados del mundo. Durante la misión, él y Zubritsky realizaron dos paseos espaciales para mantenimiento y mejoras en la ISS, con duraciones de más de seis horas cada uno.

La subvención autonómica ha pasado de 250.000 euros hace dos años a solo 12.000 en la última convocatoria, una reducción del 95%. El Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso justifica el cambio por un nuevo modelo de financiación basado en proyectos concretos y no en ayudas nominativas. Sin embargo, Hernández León considera que esta decisión responde a una forma de censura cultural y a una represalia por las actividades críticas que el CBA ha albergado, como exposiciones sobre Gaza, actos relacionados con la memoria histórica o el apoyo al arte comprometido.

Según el texto, la derecha habría adoptado desde hace décadas tácticas mediáticas y judiciales para debilitar a los gobiernos progresistas cuando no logra imponerse en las urnas. La pieza sugiere que parte de la judicatura y de ciertos medios de comunicación estarían actuando de forma coordinada para desprestigiar a figuras del Gobierno. En concreto, el artículo menciona el caso del Fiscal General del Estado, Álvaro Ortiz, cuya reciente condena por revelación de secretos es calificada como injusta y políticamente motivada.

Según el Juzgado de Instrucción nº5 de la localidad, existen indicios suficientes para continuar la investigación sobre la contratación de una mujer, identificada como C.P., como personal eventual del Ayuntamiento entre febrero y marzo de 2023. Durante ese periodo, los informes judiciales y de recursos humanos reflejan que no consta registro de actividad, control horario ni evidencias de que realizara funciones laborales. En paralelo, se acreditó que el alcalde mantenía una relación personal e íntima con ella y que previamente le había transferido 21.000 euros en un año para ayudarla económicamente.

Tras la detección de los primeros casos, se activaron medidas preventivas e inspecciones en el centro universitario, con el objetivo de identificar el origen del brote y evitar su propagación.

También se reportó que uno de ellos sufría cataratas y dificultad para caminar. Las imágenes, compartidas en redes sociales, han reavivado el debate sobre el uso de animales en festejos públicos.

El Ayuntamiento de El Escorial ha respondido afirmando que la actividad se realizó conforme a la normativa vigente de bienestar y sanidad animal, con supervisión veterinaria y todas las autorizaciones requeridas.

En cuanto a la vida presente, los posibles microbios marcianos podrían encontrarse bajo la superficie, protegidos de la radiación, lo que requiere equipos de perforación capaces de alcanzar decenas o cientos de metros. Además de la búsqueda de vida, otros objetivos incluyen estudiar la habitabilidad de Marte, caracterizar los ciclos de agua y dióxido de carbono, analizar el registro geológico, evaluar los efectos del entorno marciano sobre humanos y organismos, entender las tormentas de polvo, estudiar el impacto del regolito y el polvo marciano, explorar recursos locales y medir la radiación en el planeta rojo.

El autor sostiene que el poder estadounidense, fundado tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial en bases económicas, tecnológicas, militares y culturales, ha entrado en una fase de degradación estructural. Aunque el país mantiene su supremacía militar, su peso económico global se ha reducido drásticamente: el PIB ha pasado de representar el 40 % del mundial en 1960 al 29,2 % en 2024, la producción industrial del 40 % al 19 %, y el comercio internacional del 30 % al 10 %. Paralelamente, el autor destaca cómo el deterioro doméstico refleja rasgos propios de economías subdesarrolladas: aumento de la desigualdad, deterioro de infraestructuras y precarización de la vida laboral.

Arteuparte cerró en 2023 tras más de una década de existencia, pero resurgió en 2024 bajo el sello de Jot Down, simbolizando la capacidad de transformación de estas iniciativas. Revista Mercurio también vivió sucesivos cierres y renacimientos desde su fundación en 1999, adaptándose a nuevas realidades editoriales y a modelos de financiación cooperativos. Fernández subraya que la supervivencia de estas publicaciones no responde a razones económicas, sino a un compromiso ético y cultural de editores y colaboradores.

Hoy, tras acumular deuda, su valor se reduce a 140 millones y pasa a manos de Picea. Este fenómeno no se limita a las aspiradoras: marcas como Volvo, Motorola, Segway, IBM PC y GE Appliances también han terminado bajo propiedad china. Europa ha intentado frenar algunas adquisiciones, como la compra de iRobot por Amazon, pero estas medidas han tenido resultados contraproducentes, ya que la tecnología termina igualmente en manos chinas.

El modelo consistía en ceder la gestión de hospitales públicos a empresas privadas bajo un sistema de pago por cápita, con el supuesto objetivo de mejorar la eficiencia y reducir costes. Según Montón, estas concesiones se demostraron insostenibles sin una dependencia de los recursos públicos, provocando sobrecostes, falta de transparencia y menores condiciones laborales.

A través de imágenes de archivo, la película muestra cómo George H. W. Bush, pese a prometer combatir el calentamiento global durante su campaña y al inicio de su presidencia, terminó cediendo ante los intereses de la industria petrolera y las presiones económicas internas. Nombró como administrador de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental a William K. Reilly, un conservacionista, pero permitió que su jefe de gabinete, John Sununu, limitara cualquier intento de regulación ecológica. El desastre del petrolero Exxon Valdez en Alaska en 1989 simbolizó una oportunidad perdida para cambiar el rumbo energético de EE. UU., que en lugar de reducir el consumo de combustibles fósiles, lo incrementó.

Tras un devastador incendio a mediados del siglo XXI, muchos libros se perdieron, mientras que unos cien mil sufrieron daños parciales. Para preservar los fragmentos sobrevivientes, el dueño creó la 'biblioteca de los libros quemados', donde se custodiaron tanto sus obras como fragmentos de otros textos que sobrevivieron a diversas catástrofes y destrucciones. La narración se centra en la visita de Chess a esta biblioteca, donde investiga la obra de Staszek y otros autores, asegurando que ciertos libros de gran difusión, como los de AsimoV y Casandra, no desaparecieron completamente pese a los colapsos digitales y las destrucciones de libros.

Este abono, con un precio de 60 euros al mes —y de 30 euros para menores de 26 años—, permitirá viajar en trenes de media distancia, servicios de Cercanías y autobuses estatales. La medida forma parte de una estrategia más amplia para fomentar la movilidad sostenible y aliviar los gastos de transporte de las familias trabajadoras y la clase media. El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha destacado que el nuevo título contribuirá a reducir el uso del vehículo privado, disminuir las emisiones y hacer más accesible el transporte público para todos los ciudadanos.

El abono estará disponible a partir de la segunda quincena de enero de 2026 y su implementación inicial cubrirá los servicios gestionados por el Estado. No obstante, el Ejecutivo ha invitado a comunidades autónomas y ayuntamientos a sumarse a la iniciativa, integrando sus redes de metro, autobuses urba]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-lanza-un-abono-unico-nacional-de-transporte-de-60-euros-mensuales-para-trenes-y-autobuses</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-lanza-un-abono-unico-nacional-de-transporte-de-60-euros-mensuales-para-trenes-y-autobuses</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenida en Alcossebre una mujer reclamada por Países Bajos por delitos de trata y explotación de menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Guardia Civil ha detenido en Alcossebre (Castellón) a una mujer sobre la que pesaba una Orden Europea de Detención emitida por las autoridades de los Países Bajos.

El operativo permitió rescatar a cuatro menores que se encontraban bajo su cuidado y que ahora permanecen en un centro de acogida en buen estado. La investigación comenzó el 7 de diciembre, cuando la Policía Local de Alcalà de Xivert encontró a dos jóvenes, de 13 y 17 años, que aseguraron haber sido abandonados por la detenida, quien siguió su viaje con otros dos menores.

Según documentos y comunicaciones internas a los que ha tenido acceso La Razón, la cúpula de Vox buscaba controlar directamente Revuelta y apropiarse de los fondos recaudados por la asociación. El conflicto se centra en la gestión de los 'cientos de miles' de euros que la organización recaudó para ayudar a afectados por las riadas en la Comunidad Valenciana, dinero que, según Vox, no fue distribuido correctamente. La disputa se intensificó tras una cena el 19 de marzo, en la que Kiko Méndez-Monasterio, cercano a Santiago Abascal, dejó claro que el partido debía asumir el control de Revuelta, argumentando que la asociación era un proyecto financiado por Vox y que no podía operar de manera independiente.

Los usuarios comentan que los bloqueos obligan a usar VPN para acceder a la web, mientras que quienes consumen fútbol pirata no sufren restricciones.

En el texto, Vox sostiene que diversos colectivos antifascistas protagonizan una escalada de violencia contra actos y militantes de su partido y contra otros rivales ideológicos.

En la primera edición de la recién estrenada Liga de Campeones, Daum cometió un error administrativo al alinear a cuatro jugadores extranjeros frente al Leeds United, cuando la normativa solo permitía tres. Pese a haber ganado el partido de ida por 3-0, el Stuttgart perdió la eliminatoria en los despachos tras la denuncia, obligando a la UEFA a organizar un insólito partido de desempate en el Camp Nou, donde el Leeds obtuvo la clasificación. El caso se convirtió en símbolo de una época previa a la ley Bosman, en la que las regulaciones nacionales sobre jugadores foráneos eran estrictas y los errores administrativos podían cambiar el destino de una competición.

Sin embargo, su papel más emblemático fue en la película animada de Walt Disney 'Bambi', donde sirvió de modelo y voz para el joven cervatillo. A pesar del éxito, su carrera cinematográfica terminó con el estallido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y los problemas familiares que lo llevaron a un orfanato.

Miembro veterano de ETA desde los años 60, fue considerado uno de los terroristas más duros de la organización, especialmente en los años 70 y 80. Se le atribuye la autoría del secuestro, tortura y asesinato en 1973 de tres jóvenes gallegos —José Humberto Fouz, Jorge Juan García y Fernando Quiroga— tras ser confundidos con policías. El exagente infiltrado Mikel Lejarza, 'El Lobo', relató que Peixoto llegó a presumir de haber torturado personalmente a las víctimas. Posteriormente, tras sufrir un atentado del Batallón Vasco Español en 1979, su papel dentro de ETA pasó a ser más logístico, centrado en el cobro del 'impuesto revolucionario' a empresarios vascos.

Durante los años 80, Peixoto fue dirigente de ETA y de Herri Batasuna, defendiendo posturas ideológicas que justificaban la violencia, incluido el asesinato de la exetarra Yoyes.

Las naciones más desarrolladas suelen ser países seculares, mientras que los estados con mayor religiosidad tienden a ser menos prósperos. Aunque ha existido debate sobre la causalidad, un estudio publicado en 'Science Advances' analizó 109 países durante el siglo XX y concluyó que, en aproximadamente el 90% de los casos, la secularización precede al crecimiento económico, más que al revés. Además, la investigación destaca que la protección de derechos individuales —incluyendo el derecho al aborto, al divorcio y la aceptación de la diversidad sexual— también contribuye a una mayor probabilidad de prosperidad. Este enfoque sugiere que los gobiernos interesados en fomentar la riqueza deberían centrarse no solo en políticas económicas tradicionales, sino también en garantizar la separación entre Estado y religión y en la protección de los derechos humanos, especialme]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-secularizacion-y-el-respeto-a-los-derechos-humanos-como-factores-de-desarrollo-economico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-secularizacion-y-el-respeto-a-los-derechos-humanos-como-factores-de-desarrollo-economico</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 14:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europa reacciona ante la nueva Estrategia de Seguridad Nacional de EE. UU. y la pérdida de su papel subordinado en defensa]]></title><description><![CDATA[La publicación de la nueva Estrategia de Seguridad Nacional (NSS) de Estados Unidos, bajo la presidencia de Donald Trump, ha provocado una fuerte reacción en las élites políticas y de pensamiento europeas. Desde Berlín hasta Varsovia, muchos líderes han expresado su desconcierto ante una estrategia que prioriza los intereses propios de Washington y deja claro que EE. UU. ya no está dispuesto a ser el garante incondicional de la seguridad europea. El canciller alemán Friedrich Merz la calificó de 'inaceptable', mientras que el primer ministro polaco Donald Tusk recordó que ambos aliados se enfrentan a los mismos enemigos, en referencia a Rusia. Sin embargo, el nuevo enfoque estadounidense busca rebajar la tensión con Moscú, en abierto contraste con la postura europea.

Ibáñez critica duramente estas memorias, calificándolas de 'vendetta personal' contra los actuales Reyes, de exaltación de Francisco Franco y de humillación hacia las víctimas de la dictadura. Según el diputado, el libro refleja una búsqueda de protagonismo y supone un error que debilita el legado del monarca emérito, además de justificar aspectos controvertidos de su vida personal y su papel en negocios privados. Ibáñez también ha instado al Gobierno a desclasificar los documentos reservados sobre el golpe de Estado del 23F.

Según la Fiscalía y varios testigos, las empresas interesadas en obtener autorizaciones se veían obligadas a incluir en sus sociedades a compañías 'locales' vinculadas a altos cargos de la Junta, o de lo contrario sus solicitudes quedaban paralizadas. Estas sociedades, en connivencia con la Consejería de Economía, obtenían beneficios ilícitos a través de la compraventa inflada de participaciones.

Los hechos, según su testimonio, se produjeron entre los 13 y los 15 años e incluyeron tocamientos, abusos reiterados y una relación de control psicológico y espiritual prolongada en el tiempo.

La decisión de denunciar se desencadenó tras una llamada recibida en noviembre de 2024 por parte del propio sacerdote, en la que este le trasladó que responsables del Opus Dei le habían preguntado si pensaba denunciar. Para Merino, ese contacto fue determinante para tomar conciencia del control que el agresor había ejercido durante décadas y dar el paso de contar públicamente lo ocurrido. Tras un año de reflexión, presentó denuncia en el juzgado de Instrucción de Pamplona y anunció que también acudirá al Defensor del Pueblo.

Esta operación ha generado alarma entre expertos en ciberseguridad e inteligencia, ya que la dirección de Kiteworks incluye a varios antiguos miembros de la unidad de inteligencia israelí 8200. La adquisición implica que los datos de ciudadanos europeos pasan a estar bajo jurisdicción estadounidense, lo que abre la puerta a posibles accesos por parte de las autoridades de EE.

Las empresas Fornela Multiservicios y Proyectos Imifer, gestionadas por su hijo y su nieto, obtuvieron la mayoría de los contratos mediante procedimientos menores —sin publicidad ni libre concurrencia—, práctica que la legislación permite bajo ciertos importes, aunque reduce la transparencia. En total, Fornela recibió 859 contratos por un valor de 7,7 millones de euros, e Imifer otros 487 por 2,3 millones. El 70 % del importe total se adjudicó de forma directa y, en el caso de Imifer, todos los contratos fueron a dedo.

Howlett explicó que 'Hot Dog Stand' fue uno de los muchos temas creados por un pequeño equipo de diseñadores que experimentaba con las 16 tonalidades disponibles en el sistema. A pesar de su aspecto llamativo, el esquema no fue concebido como una burla ni como ejemplo de mal diseño, sino simplemente como una opción más dentro de una gama de estilos pensados para diferentes gustos.

El suceso tuvo lugar durante la mañana, cuando un conductor de unos 50 años perdió el control de su coche por causas que aún se investigan. El vehículo invadió la acera y arrolló a las tres víctimas, provocando la muerte inmediata de la menor e hiriendo a sus familiares, que fueron trasladadas de urgencia al hospital. 

Fuentes municipales confirmaron que el conductor dio negativo en el control de alcoholemia y salió ileso del accidente, aunque fue trasladado al hospital para someterle a distintas pruebas médicas. Las autoridades mantienen abierta la investigación para esclarecer las circunstancias exactas que llevaron al vehículo a desviarse del carril y provocar el trágico atropello.

El fuerte temporal ha anegado el único acceso rodado a la zona de viviendas, haciendo imposible la salida tanto en coche como a pie. Eduardo Serrano, uno de los vecinos afectados, ha explicado que el agua se acumula siempre en el mismo punto del camino, junto a una fábrica, por ser el tramo más bajo. En esta ocasión, el nivel del agua ha subido hasta las ventanas de los vehículos, convirtiendo en peligroso cualquier intento de circular. Los bomberos han tenido que rescatar a dos personas con una barca, además de intervenir en otro incidente en el que un coche quedó atrapado. Según los vecinos, la situación no es nueva y se repite en episodios de lluvias intensas. A pesar de los avisos a la Policía Local, los bomberos y la empresa Facsa, todavía no se ha adoptado una solución definitiva.

La decisión, tomada tras una petición de la Duma rusa en 2024, implica que cualquier colaboración con DW será considerada delito y podrá acarrear multas o penas de prisión. Incluso compartir su contenido en redes sociales será ilegal. Esta medida se suma a una larga lista de restricciones aplicadas por el Kremlin contra medios y organizaciones extranjeras, como Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Bellingcat o Reporteros Sin Fronteras. La directora general de DW, Barbara Massing, ha condenado la decisión y la ha interpretado como parte del intento del Gobierno ruso de silenciar a los medios libres.

C., del Grupo Typsa y responsable de la presa de Buseo, envió varios correos electrónicos alertando sobre un punto de debilidad en el estribo izquierdo de la presa. Indicaba que, según los datos del Sistema Automático de Información Hidrológica (SAIH), era probable que la presa hubiera superado la cota de coronación y podría estar vertiendo agua, con un elevado caudal hacia la localidad de Sot de Chera. En su comunicación, recomendaba desalojar la parte baja del pueblo, pero lamentablemente, las dos víctimas —un padre y su hijo— fallecieron antes de recibir aviso alguno. Los correos reflejan también la dificultad de los responsables de la infraestructura para evaluar en tiempo real el estado de la presa y la complicación añadida por carreteras cortadas que impedían el acceso físico de los técnicos.

Documentos internos y correos electrónicos de 2024 muestran que se establecieron cupos en quirófanos para cumplir objetivos económicos y presupuestarios, favoreciendo así a pacientes 'no cápita', que generan un pago adicional al hospital. Estas prácticas afectaban a diversas especialidades, incluyendo cirugía cardíaca y maternidad, y mantenían diferencias significativas en los tiempos de espera, con pacientes locales esperando más de 130 días frente a menos de un mes para los externos. Aunque la Comunidad de Madrid y Ribera Salud niegan irregularidades, varios empleados y manifestaciones públicas de profesionales alertaron de la priorización basada en criterios económicos.

Este proyecto buscaba proteger a los trabajadores frente a despidos injustificados, mejorar las condiciones laborales y garantizar el pago desde el primer día de baja por enfermedad. Según la Trades Union Congress (TUC), la iniciativa también pretendía impedir que los empleadores asignaran horarios según su conveniencia y proteger a empleados con menos de dos años de antigüedad de despidos arbitrarios. La reacción de los votantes en Clacton, recogida en un video publicado en X, reflejó sorpresa y malestar, con algunos ciudadanos declarando que esperaban un mayor compromiso de Farage con los derechos humanos y laborales.

Según el Ministerio de Sanidad, faltan cerca de 5.874 médicos y más de 100.000 enfermeras, cifras que se prevé aumenten significativamente de aquí a 2029. El déficit se concentra sobre todo en Atención Primaria, donde se realiza la mayoría de la actividad asistencial, pero que sigue infradotada presupuestariamente. Este desequilibrio ha provocado que los pacientes deban esperar más de tres meses para acudir a un especialista o someterse a una intervención programada, siendo dermatología, neurología y traumatología las áreas más afectadas.

Según el autor, Europa ha quedado atrapada en un marco ideológico y político del que no puede salir sin poner en riesgo su propia legitimidad. El artículo sostiene que la guerra no se mantiene por convicción en la victoria, sino porque las instituciones europeas carecen de mecanismos para dar marcha atrás y asumir errores. Vermeulen repasa cómo el discurso moralista inicial sobre la defensa de los valores democráticos ha convertido cualquier intento de negociación o realismo en una forma de traición, bloqueando así toda posibilidad de solución diplomática. Además, describe una UE dependiente de Estados Unidos y condicionada por los traumas históricos de Europa del Este, lo que ha intensificado su postura frente a Rusia.

A diferencia de los motores de imanes permanentes convencionales, que operan con un campo magnético fijo, los motores de flujo variable pueden modificar la intensidad magnética durante su funcionamiento.

Destaca el gesto simbólico de varios países europeos —España, Países Bajos, Irlanda, Eslovenia e Islandia— al retirarse del festival de Eurovisión 2026 en protesta por la participación de Israel, una medida que contrasta con la pasividad general del resto del mundo.

Este fenómeno, descrito por los científicos como una auténtica pandemia marina, ha provocado la desaparición de hasta el 99,7 % de los erizos Diadema africanum en Tenerife entre 2022 y 2023. Los erizos desempeñan un papel clave en la regulación de las algas que cubren los arrecifes, por lo que su pérdida amenaza con desequilibrar gravemente el ecosistema marino.

La resolución, fruto de una demanda interpuesta por Facua, establece que estas prácticas vulneran los derechos de los consumidores al obligarles a adquirir productos de restauración dentro del evento, lo que constituye un servicio complementario no solicitado. El juez Vicente Sanchís subraya que el festival tiene como actividad principal la música y que la restauración es un servicio accesorio, por lo que impedir el acceso con alimentos y bebidas propios impone una carga injustificada a los asistentes.

Tras la guerra, continuó su trabajo en publicaciones soviéticas como Pravda durante la Guerra Fría, criticando la política y economía estadounidense mediante un estilo satírico y propagandístico.

Estas cifras elevan el total anual a 46 víctimas y el acumulado desde 2003 a 1.341. Entre las víctimas destacan Sayuri, de 36 años, asesinada en L'Hospitalet mientras enviaba dinero a sus hijos en Colombia; Jennifer, de 30 años, en Sevilla; Rossmery, de 39 años, en Toledo; Oriana, de 29 años, en Alicante, y otra mujer de 50 años en Catarroja. Muchas de estas víctimas tenían hijos presentes o se encontraban en situaciones de separación, lo que incrementa el riesgo.

Dirigido por David Borenstein y el profesor ruso Pavel “Pasha” Talankin, el filme muestra con crudeza cómo la propaganda y la militarización se infiltraron en el sistema educativo ruso tras la invasión de Ucrania en 2022. Pasha, un maestro de primaria en una zona rural, decide grabar en secreto la transformación de su escuela, documentando el adoctrinamiento político que afecta tanto a estudiantes como a docentes.

Plamberger, un alpinista experimentado, realizó una ascensión junto a su novia, Kerstin Gurtner, quien carecía de experiencia y del equipo adecuado para condiciones extremas invernales. Durante la subida, ambos se encontraron con un clima extremadamente adverso, con ráfagas de viento de hasta 70 km/h y temperaturas que se sentían 20 grados bajo cero. A pesar de recibir la posibilidad de asistencia mediante helicóptero, Plamberger decidió continuar la ascensión y más tarde descendió solo en busca de ayuda, dejando a su pareja en la montaña con el teléfono en silencio. La víctima falleció congelada durante la noche. La investigación destaca varios errores críticos por parte del alpinista: no respondió a los servicios de rescate, no buscó ayuda de inmediato y expuso a una persona inexperta a riesgos extremos.

La medida busca reducir el creciente número de incidentes y ordenar el uso de estos vehículos en entornos urbanos. Las sanciones por incumplimiento oscilarán entre 200 y 1.000 euros, y la circulación sin cumplir los requisitos será prohibida hasta regularizar la situación administrativa. La normativa también contempla un periodo de adaptación técnica: desde el 22 de enero de 2027 solo podrán circular patinetes homologados según las características oficiales. Los seguros tendrán un coste anual aproximado de 20 a 100 euros dependiendo de la cobertura.

Bajo el liderazgo cada vez más autoritario de Vladímir Putin, Moscú invierte recursos significativos en campañas de desinformación que combinan granjas de bots, manipulación en redes sociales, medios de comunicación y servicios de inteligencia. Estas campañas buscan polarizar a la sociedad y manipular debates sobre temas sensibles como migración, refugiados, coste de la vida o precios de la energía, adaptando los mensajes a la realidad y preocupaciones de cada país. El Servicio Europeo de Acción Exterior ha detectado que la sofisticación y alcance de estas acciones crecen cada año, alcanzando picos especialmente en periodos electorales, como se ha observado en Rumanía y Moldavia.

Estos grupos canalizan las inseguridades y frustraciones de muchos hombres jóvenes —la soledad, la precariedad o el miedo al futuro— hacia discursos antifeministas y, en algunos casos, de extrema derecha. Según Alabao, las plataformas digitales amplifican estos mensajes por su capacidad de generar atención y beneficio económico. Los algoritmos premian los contenidos extremos y polarizadores, lo que refuerza la difusión de estas ideologías. La autora plantea además que la llamada 'brecha política de género' se ha profundizado: mientras las mujeres tienden a posiciones progresistas, muchos hombres jóvenes se inclinan hacia ideas conservadoras o misóginas. Esto tiene raíces en la crisis de las masculinidades tradicionales y en la falta de referentes alternativos.

Se utilizan figuras públicas como Ana Rosa Quintana, Carmen Machi, Javier Sardá, Henar Álvarez o Pepón Nieto, y se aborda la polarización política de manera superficial, equiparando agresor y víctima y disfrazando el insulto como moralina navideña. Destaca el uso de la expresión “con lo que a mí me gusta la fruta” por Ana Rosa Quintana, un eufemismo político que remite a un insulto directo de Isabel Díaz Ayuso a Pedro Sánchez en 2023, lo que demuestra que el anuncio no es equidistante sino que incorpora lenguaje político cargado.

En una extensa entrevista, Giménez considera que el fallo supone una 'locura jurídica' y que se basa en una certeza construida a partir de una duda, sin pruebas empíricas suficientes. Según el exmagistrado, la resolución vulnera derechos fundamentales como el acceso a una información veraz y el secreto profesional de los periodistas, pilares esenciales de una sociedad democrática.

Giménez denunció que la instrucción del caso fue de carácter inquisitorial y que el tribunal actuó con sesgos ideológicos, lo que, en su opinión, pone en entredicho la imparcialidad del Supremo.

Cruz Estrada, que llegó a Estados Unidos siendo niño y siguió los pasos de su madre en el cuerpo de bomberos, expresó su frustración y sentimiento de traición: consideraba que los agentes deberían haber priorizado la emergencia y no su estatus migratorio.

El sultán Hassanal Bolkiah, en el trono desde 1967, es conocido por su colosal fortuna (estimada en unos 50.000 millones de dólares) y sus extravagancias, que van desde coleccionar más de 7.000 coches de lujo —ninguno menos que 450 Ferraris— hasta poseer aviones privados recubiertos de oro. Su hermano, el príncipe Jefri, protagonizó un escándalo monumental cuando se descubrió que había desviado miles de millones de dólares del fondo soberano del país, aunque finalmente devolvió parte de las propiedades adquiridas.

En la entrevista con elDiario.es, Martí describe una situación humanitaria crítica: más de dos millones de gazatíes sobreviven sin agua potable, con el sistema sanitario colapsado y miles de personas desplazadas viviendo bajo lonas en condiciones insalubres. La supuesta tregua acordada entre Estados Unidos e Israel, afirma, no ha supuesto el fin de la violencia, ya que el ejército israelí continúa atacando a civiles y expandiendo su presencia militar. La UNRWA mantiene 12.000 trabajadores activos, en su mayoría palestinos, que prestan asistencia médica, educativa y alimentaria pese a los continuos peligros.

Miguel Ángel Llamas, coordinador autonómico y candidato a la Presidencia de la Junta, explicó que esta empresa pública nacería con tres objetivos principales: abaratar los precios de los alimentos para las familias, ofrecer precios justos a los pequeños productores y fortalecer el sector primario local. Según Llamas, el modelo pretende contrarrestar la 'intermediación especulativa' y fomentar la economía de proximidad como alternativa a la concentración del poder de las grandes empresas del sector. La iniciativa plantea también un sistema de gestión participativo, mediante un consejo sectorial que integre a organizaciones agroganaderas, cooperativas y asociaciones de consumidores para garantizar la transparencia y la democracia en su funcionamiento.

Acusado de terrorismo y alta traición junto a otros ocho procesados, Reuß ha rechazado todas las acusaciones, afirmando que nunca planeó actos violentos ni participó en ninguna conspiración armada para derrocar al Estado alemán. Según la Fiscalía, el grupo pretendía atacar el Bundestag y establecer un nuevo gobierno bajo la ideología conspirativa y antisemita de los 'Reichsbürger' y QAnon. En su declaración, el acusado ha tratado de distanciarse de dicha ideología, presentándose como un hombre confundido por la desinformación de las redes sociales y víctima de manipulaciones, tanto de sus supuestos cómplices como de falsas narrativas políticas.

Esta decisión fue firmada por Enrique Ossorio, entonces consejero de Hacienda y actual presidente de la Asamblea madrileña, pese a que el Ejecutivo ya contaba con datos sobre la ineficacia de un préstamo anterior de 80 millones que la entidad había recibido en 2011. Ese préstamo, destinado a impulsar proyectos de I+D+i, apenas ha sido devuelto: Madrid Network solo reembolsó dos cuotas por un total de 10,9 millones, mientras que el Gobierno regional ha tenido que asumir más de 70 millones en pérdidas. 

Madrid Network, creada en 2007 por iniciativa de Esperanza Aguirre, nunca ha presentado sus cuentas en el registro de asociaciones y no está considerada de utilidad pública.

La investigación que destapó este caso, que culminó con su detención en noviembre de 2025, también permitió incautar más de una tonelada de cocaína y la captura de varios miembros del clan narcotraficante.

La falta de inversión suficiente por parte de la Comunidad de Madrid, cuyo aporte ha crecido solo un 5% en 15 años mientras la inflación subió un 44%, ha llevado a la universidad a depender de préstamos con intereses para cubrir gastos esenciales.

Con esta obra, el grupo dejó atrás la crudeza punk de sus inicios para explorar nuevas fusiones con estilos como el rockabilly, el reggae, el ska, el dub, el funk e incluso el pop. La portada, con Paul Simonon rompiendo su bajo en el escenario, se convirtió en un icono inmediato del espíritu rebelde del rock. El álbum destacó tanto por su diversidad musical como por su compromiso político. Las letras abordaban temas como el desempleo, la represión, la guerra y el consumismo, reflejando la inquietud social de finales de los setenta. Canciones como “The Guns of Brixton”, “Spanish Bombs” o “Train in Vain” mostraron la madurez artística de una banda que ya no solo era punk, sino un fenómeno cultural global.

De esta cifra, 168 millones (un 12%) procedieron de su patrimonio inmobiliario, financiero y otras actividades económicas, mientras que 66 millones se clasificaron como ingresos extraordinarios derivados de enajenaciones de patrimonio y subvenciones de capital. La institución argumenta que utilizó el superávit de 133 millones para reducir deudas acumuladas, especialmente durante la pandemia. 

Parte importante de los recursos provino de los fondos públicos obtenidos mediante la casilla del IRPF, que representaron 326 millones, y de otras vías como los ingresos corrientes —434 millones, procedentes en gran medida de entradas a monumentos y subvenciones— y las aportaciones de los fieles, que sumaron 399 millones.

El vuelo, pilotado por Al White y el coronel Joe Cotton, tenía como objetivo alcanzar Mach 3, pero poco después del despegue el tren de aterrizaje delantero se atascó debido a un cortocircuito. Los intentos por desplegarlo fracasaron: el sistema hidráulico y la copia de seguridad eléctrica estaban muertos, y los neumáticos quedaron destrozados. La situación era crítica, ya que un aterrizaje sin tren delantero supondría la pérdida total del avión y un grave riesgo para los pilotos. Durante más de dos horas, los ingenieros desde tierra revisaron los esquemas y localizaron el problema en un disyuntor averiado. La única forma de salvar la aeronave era reconectar manualmente el circuito, pero los pilotos no disponían de herramientas a bordo.

Esta decisión, impulsada de manera unilateral y sin aprobación del Congreso, tuvo lugar durante un cierre del gobierno federal, lo que agrava la controversia por su inoportunidad y simbolismo.

El autor sostiene que sus declaraciones y decisiones reflejan una preocupante falta de cultura política, rigor diplomático y comprensión histórica, las cuales, según él, contribuyen al descrédito internacional de la Unión Europea. El texto repasa varios incidentes controvertidos protagonizados por Kallas, como su afirmación de que la Federación Rusa debía disolverse en repúblicas, o su supuesto desconocimiento del papel de Rusia y China en la victoria contra el nazismo. Asimismo, se menciona la confección del 'Libro Blanco Conjunto sobre la Preparación de la Defensa Europea 2030', que el autor tilda de superficial y carente de contenido estratégico. También se destaca el rechazo del secretario de Estado estadounidense Marco Rubio a reunirse con la dirigente europea, así como la reacción airada ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-politica-exterior-europea-bajo-la-direccion-de-kaja-kallas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-politica-exterior-europea-bajo-la-direccion-de-kaja-kallas</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 14:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los audios revelan tensiones internas en Vox por el caso Revuelta y el presunto desvío de fondos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La exclusiva de ElPlural.com sobre una serie de audios filtrados ha desatado una nueva crisis en el partido Vox. En las grabaciones, se revelan conversaciones entre dirigentes próximos a Santiago Abascal y responsables de la asociación juvenil Revuelta, en las que se discuten estrategias para encubrir un presunto desvío de fondos destinados originalmente a ayudar a las víctimas de la DANA. Los audios involucran a figuras como el diputado Manuel Mariscal y al asesor europeo Arturo Villa, quienes habrían buscado cerrar Revuelta y minimizar el impacto mediático del caso.

El escándalo pone en entredicho el discurso de ejemplaridad y “limpieza” que Abascal ha defendido públicamente, especialmente frente a las acusaciones de corrupción dirigidas al PSOE y al Partido Popular. Mientras Vox asegura haber denunciado las irregularidades detectadas en Revuelta, la asociación juvenil afirma que sus cuentas están pendientes de una auditoría y que la polémica responde más a un intento de Abascal por]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-audios-revelan-tensiones-internas-en-vox-por-el-caso-revuelta-y-el-presunto-desvio-de-fondos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-audios-revelan-tensiones-internas-en-vox-por-el-caso-revuelta-y-el-presunto-desvio-de-fondos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 14:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dongfeng eπ 007: la primera berlina eléctrica china con cuatro motores en las ruedas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dongfeng ha presentado el eπ 007, una berlina eléctrica que marca un hito en la industria automovilística china al ser el primer modelo de producción masiva que integra cuatro motores eléctricos en las ruedas. Este avance técnico, desarrollado con la colaboración de Shanghai Automobile Electric Drive Co., Ltd., representa un cambio de paradigma en el diseño y eficiencia de los vehículos eléctricos. Cada motor ofrece 100 kW de potencia, alcanzando una cifra total de 394 kW (536 CV). Gracias a la eliminación de transmisiones, diferenciales y ejes convencionales, el sistema reduce las pérdidas mecánicas en un 30 % y mejora notablemente la maniobrabilidad mediante el control independiente del par en cada rueda (Torque Vectoring). 

El diseño también optimiza el espacio interior, permitiendo un suelo completamente plano y una mejor distribución de la batería y el peso, lo que aporta mayor comodidad y seguridad.

En tono de broma, Feijóo dijo ante un auditorio lleno de simpatizantes del Partido Popular que había quedado con la intérprete para tomar una copa, añadiendo que ella le había dicho que no, pero que aun así lo iba a intentar. El comentario, recogido en un vídeo de aquella noche, generó risas y reacciones divididas entre los asistentes. En aquel momento, Mera tenía 24 años y el mandatario 49. La polémica ha resurgido en 2025 después de que Feijóo criticara al presidente Pedro Sánchez por, según él, ‘proteger a machistas’, lo que reavivó este episodio del pasado. Los partidos de la oposición, especialmente el BNG y el PSOE, tacharon entonces el comportamiento del líder popular de machista y fuera de lugar, señalando que trataba a la actriz como un objeto]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/feijoo-protagonizo-un-comentario-inapropiado-sobre-una-actriz-durante-un-acto-en-2010</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/feijoo-protagonizo-un-comentario-inapropiado-sobre-una-actriz-durante-un-acto-en-2010</guid><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 13:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Informe revela asalto de comandos de EE.

Reino Unido apoyaba a otro candidato, Hamud, y exigió a Khalid que abandonara el palacio. El joven sultán, confiado en sus tres mil seguidores, ignoró la advertencia. A las nueve de la mañana expiró el ultimátum y, apenas dos minutos después, las fuerzas británicas abrieron fuego desde cinco buques de guerra anclados frente al palacio. En menos de tres cuartos de hora, el edificio fue reducido a escombros y las defensas zanzibareñas colapsaron. Khalid escapó refugiándose en el consulado alemán, mientras las tropas pro-británicas tomaban el control.

Gracias a las observaciones del telescopio espacial James Webb (JWST), los científicos detectaron variaciones térmicas que sugieren la existencia de una capa gaseosa densa sobre un océano global de magma. Este hallazgo, publicado en la revista The Astrophysical Journal Letters, representa la evidencia más sólida hasta la fecha de una atmósfera en un mundo rocoso fuera del sistema solar. TOI-561 b, con un radio 1,4 veces superior al de la Tierra, orbita extremadamente cerca de su estrella, completando una vuelta en menos de 11 horas y exponiéndose a temperaturas diurnas superiores a los 1.800 ºC. Sin embargo, esos valores son inferiores a los que se esperarían si careciera de atmósfera, lo que sugiere que existe un mecanismo de transporte de calor entre hemisferios.

La manifestación, organizada bajo el lema '¡Basta ya! Manifestación en defensa de los menores', fue impulsada por el principal líder opositor, Péter Magyar, del partido conservador Tisza. La concentración recorrió el centro de la capital hasta la sede del primer ministro en el barrio del Castillo de Buda, congregando a decenas de miles de personas según el portal independiente 444.hu.

Magyar acusó al Gobierno de no proteger a los menores y de ocultar informes sobre maltratos. Según datos difundidos por él, un informe de 2021 documenta más de 3.300 presuntos casos de abuso en hogares infantiles, incluyendo agresiones físicas y sexuales. El documento sugiere que la cifra real podría ser aún mayor.

En este contexto, Steam ha anunciado soporte completo para el mando, eliminando los problemas de compatibilidad que existían hasta ahora. Anteriormente, los jugadores podían usar el controlador de Stadia en Steam, pero se veían obligados a reasignar botones o configurar manualmente ciertas funciones para que funcionara correctamente. Con esta nueva integración, todos los botones se reconocen de manera nativa: los controles estándar responden sin problemas, el botón Stadia abre el menú rápido de Steam, el de capturas permite hacer screenshots directamente y la tecla del Asistente de Google puede asignarse a macros personalizadas.

Según Mussayev, el expediente de Trump estaría en manos de Vladímir Putin, aunque no aporta pruebas documentales que respalden estas afirmaciones. El texto explica que no se trata de un testimonio aislado: otros antiguos miembros de los servicios soviéticos, como Yuri Shvets y Sergei Zhyrnov, han sugerido desde hace años que Trump fue objeto de seguimiento y posible cultivo como activo por parte de la inteligencia soviética, aunque tampoco ofrecen evidencias concluyentes.

Alimentada principalmente con comida para gatos y rodeada de un entorno completamente inadecuado, llegó a estar al borde de la muerte. En febrero fue rescatada por el santuario Garden State Tortoise, en Nueva Jersey, dirigido por Chris Leone. Desde entonces, su recuperación ha sido sorprendente: ha vuelto a excavar, a cazar lombrices y a disfrutar del aire libre. Su piel ha recuperado los tonos naturales y su mirada brilla de nuevo. Recientemente, Rockalina ha alcanzado un hito importante en su rehabilitación: el encuentro con un bebé de su misma especie, una tortuguita del tamaño de una galleta Oreo.

Este proceso, basado en la sustitución de aproximadamente un 40% de los átomos de plomo en nanopartículas de bromuro de plomo y cesio, ha permitido conservar las propiedades lumínicas del material mientras se le confieren características magnéticas. El resultado es un nuevo tipo de punto cuántico que emite una luz naranja cálida, más estable y eficiente que las versiones tradicionales que emitían en el espectro azul. Este cambio cromático no depende del tamaño de las partículas, sino de su estructura interna modificada por el dopaje de manganeso. Además, estos materiales presentan una notable estabilidad frente al deterioro, eliminando la necesidad de emplear recubrimientos protectores adicionales.

La pieza, trabajada con gran detalle, destaca por la presencia de cavidades en las pupilas destinadas a incrustaciones de piedras de color, un recurso típicamente helenístico que buscaba dotar a la escultura de un realismo casi vívido. Los arqueólogos creen que esta cabeza perteneció a una estatua monumental concebida para un espacio público, probablemente el bouleuterion o consejo municipal, reforzando el carácter político y cívico de Hestia en el contexto urbano griego.

Este sistema de escritura, descubierto en los años 50, había resistido los intentos de descifrado durante generaciones. El hallazgo, publicado en la revista Dead Sea Discoveries, demuestra que los dos manuscritos escritos completamente en Críptico B —4Q362 y 4Q363— contienen pasajes y frases bíblicas conocidas, más que doctrinas esotéricas o secretos ocultos. El trabajo de Oliveiro se basó en analizar patrones repetitivos y compararlos con textos bíblicos en hebreo. Su 'momento eureka' llegó cuando identificó la palabra 'Israel' entre los símbolos, permitiéndole deducir el significado de la mayoría de los signos. El estudio también revela diferencias físicas entre los manuscritos: uno con escritura minúscula e irregular, otro con letras más grandes y separados por ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-investigador-descifra-el-codigo-criptico-b-de-los-rollos-del-mar-muerto-revelando-textos-biblicos-ocultos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-investigador-descifra-el-codigo-criptico-b-de-los-rollos-del-mar-muerto-revelando-textos-biblicos-ocultos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 23:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La empresa china EngineAi presenta su robot humanoide T800, capaz de realizar movimientos de kung-fu con gran fuerza y agilidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[La empresa china EngineAi ha presentado su último desarrollo en robótica: el modelo T800, un robot humanoide de gran agilidad y fuerza que ha causado sensación en las redes sociales. Su creador, Zhao Tongyang, demostró sus capacidades durante una exhibición en la que el propio robot llegó a derribarlo de una patada, momento que se viralizó rápidamente. La escena, aunque planificada, puso de relieve la potencia de esta tecnología, ya que el empresario reconoció que 'sin equipo de protección, nadie podría resistirlo'. Tongyang fundó EngineAi en 2023 tras haber trabajado en otra compañía especializada en robótica llamada IRON, y desde entonces ha liderado el desarrollo de este modelo pensado para tareas físicas complejas. El T800 destaca por sus movimientos fluidos, su equilibrio dinámico y su capacidad para ejecutar técnicas de artes marciales como el kung-fu, lo que hace dudar a algunos espectadores de si realmente se trata de una máquina o de un humano.

Según la investigación, la detenida ofrecía temporadas íntegras de producciones televisivas latinoamericanas como 'Mientras haya vida', 'Cuando me enamoro' o 'Amor sin límites', que enviaba por correo postal en formato DVD grabado con archivos digitales mp4 y mkv. Por cada temporada cobraba entre cinco y siete euros más los gastos de envío. La operación, denominada 'Pecadora' y dirigida por el Juzgado de Instrucción número 1 de Elche, fue desarrollada por la Unidad contra la Violencia Especializada y Violenta (UDEV), que incautó más de 1.300 DVDs falsificados, siete discos duros y un ordenador de sobremesa. La investigación comenzó tras una denuncia de la Entidad de Gestión de Derechos de los Productores Audiovisuales (EGEDA) en julio de 2025, que alertó de una red de distribución ilegal de telenovelas en España. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/arrestada-en-elche-una-mujer-acusada-de-distribuir-telenovelas-pirateadas-en-dvd-a-traves-de-internet</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/arrestada-en-elche-una-mujer-acusada-de-distribuir-telenovelas-pirateadas-en-dvd-a-traves-de-internet</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 23:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis crítico en viñetas sobre la corrupción y el fascismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La viñeta de Luiso García publicada en Diario Red aborda de manera crítica temas de corrupción, fascismo y estafas recientes, utilizando la sátira y la ilustración para provocar reflexión en la audiencia.

El autor explica cómo el movimiento nació en los años noventa entre estudiantes de madrasas que buscaban restaurar el orden y aplicar la ley islámica, apoyados inicialmente por Estados Unidos y Pakistán durante la invasión soviética. Tras su derrota en 2001 por la coalición liderada por Estados Unidos, los talibanes mantuvieron una guerra de guerrillas durante dos décadas, aprovechando la debilidad y corrupción del gobierno respaldado por Occidente, hasta recuperar el control total del país en 2021.

Las semillas se han convertido en propiedad intelectual, lo que obliga a los agricultores a comprar insumos caros cada temporada y les impide guardar semillas, generando ciclos de deuda. En países como India y Kenia, esta situación ha provocado graves problemas económicos y sociales, incluyendo suicidios y dependencia de importaciones. En México, las variedades de maíz criollo están siendo reemplazadas por cultivos transgénicos controlados por multinacionales, mientras que en EE.UU. pequeños agricultores enfrentan demandas por guardar semillas.

Sin embargo, también plantea que esa promesa de salvación futura contribuye al conformismo y la pasividad frente a las injusticias terrenales. Según el texto, las creencias religiosas no solo proporcionan alivio emocional ante la desesperanza, sino que además facilitan el control de las masas al fomentar la aceptación del sufrimiento como un camino hacia la recompensa eterna. Se sugiere que esta estructura de pensamiento perpetúa las desigualdades sociales y mantiene los privilegios de unos pocos.

En esta ocasión, el espacio perdió cerca de un punto de cuota de pantalla respecto a su debut y alrededor de 6.000 espectadores de media, quedándose en un 1,5% de share y unos 13.000 televidentes.

El análisis detallado de los datos muestra que el programa tuvo importantes dificultades para retener audiencia a lo largo de la emisión. En varios tramos de la franja nocturna, especialmente a partir de la medianoche, la cuota cayó por debajo del 1%, llegando incluso a marcar mínimos del 0,6% durante algunos minutos. Estos registros contrastan con el máximo alcanzado en torno a las 23:30 horas, que tampoco resultó especialmente competitivo frente a otras ofertas televisivas en la Comunitat Valenciana.

Aunque los datos del INE muestran que 2023 registró el mayor número absoluto de suicidios en menores de 30 años, las tasas por cada 100.000 habitantes se mantienen estables. Este contraste ha llevado a los expertos a pedir cautela antes de afirmar que exista un incremento real del fenómeno. Andoni Anseán, presidente de la Fundación Española para la Prevención del Suicidio, recuerda que las cifras deben interpretarse dentro de su contexto y que la ideación suicida y los intentos sí parecen aumentar, aunque el número de muertes no. Los profesionales coinciden en que el suicidio es un fenómeno multifactorial influido por la salud mental, la soledad no deseada, la violencia, el consumo de sustancias, el acoso —también en su versión digital— y la presión de las redes sociales.

Uno de los elementos más llamativos es el desplome de los ingresos de explotación en 2022, que pasaron de superar los 100 millones de euros en años anteriores a situarse en torno a los 37 millones, lo que supone una caída aproximada del 66%.

La presencia de munición y explosivos sin detonar sigue poniendo en riesgo a la población local, y se considera urgente mejorar el acceso de personal y equipo especializado para localizar y retirar estos artefactos y los cuerpos de víctimas aún atrapadas entre los restos. A pesar del alto el fuego vigente desde septiembre, informes de Al Jazeera y de la Oficina de Medios del Gobierno de Gaza detallan que Israel ha violado repetidamente el acuerdo, atacando civiles, realizando incursiones en zonas residenciales, bombardeando la región y deteniendo a palestinos. Solo hubo 11 días sin incidentes violentos en los primeros dos meses del alto el fuego, lo que evidencia la continuidad de la violencia.

El autor argumenta que la figura de Machado fue convertida en un personaje teatral, con elementos cuidadosamente coreografiados como la silla de ruedas o el maquillaje, para transmitir una narrativa de víctima y heroína, más que reflejar una realidad auténtica. La cobertura mediática y la recepción diplomática en Europa se presentan como una operación política que busca reforzar ciertos intereses estratégicos occidentales, especialmente de Estados Unidos, en el tablero venezolano. El artículo cuestiona la neutralidad del Nobel al involucrarse en declaraciones políticas, señalando que estas acciones contribuyen a la polarización y reducen la visibilidad de los ciudadanos comunes afectados por la situación en Venezuela.

A partir de casos reales y años de trabajo periodístico, ambos autores describen cómo el país reúne condiciones únicas para el desarrollo de esta red ilícita: una extensa costa, grandes puertos internacionales, cercanía a Marruecos y rutas africanas, y una larga tradición marítima vinculada al contrabando. El texto expone que, mientras Galicia conserva un papel constante y discreto, el gran epicentro actual del negocio se sitúa en el sur —en especial, en la Costa del Sol y el Estrecho de Gibraltar—, donde convergen grandes organizaciones y flujos por mar y contenedor.

Los resultados muestran que un porcentaje muy elevado de las merluzas vendidas frescas en España están parasitadas por larvas de Anisakis, un nematodo responsable de la enfermedad humana conocida como anisakiasis. España figura además como el país europeo con mayor incidencia de esta infección, favorecida por los hábitos de consumo de pescado crudo o poco cocinado.

El estudio identificó que la merluza europea del Atlántico nordoriental fue la más parasitada (87,8 %), seguida de la merluza plateada del Atlántico noreste americano (65,7 %) y, en menor medida, la merluza mediterránea (26 %).

Nacido en 1925 en Misuri y criado en Illinois, Van Dyke descubrió su vocación artística en el teatro escolar y desarrolló desde joven un estilo propio basado en la comedia física y el optimismo escénico.

Según informes de la ONU, estos ataques constituyeron crímenes de guerra, afectando gravemente a la población civil e instaurando un clima de miedo en la región. Un nuevo libro sobre Palantir Technologies revela que Israel contó con la asistencia de esta empresa de inteligencia artificial, fundada por Alex Karp y Peter Thiel, para ejecutar las operaciones. La tecnología de Palantir fue utilizada por el ejército israelí tanto en Gaza como en Líbano, facilitando la localización de objetivos y la coordinación de ataques que resultaron en numerosas víctimas. Altos cargos de la ONU y expertos en derechos humanos han documentado la implicación de Palantir, señalando un conocimiento y propósito directo en la utilización de fuerza de maner]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-empleo-tecnologia-de-palantir-en-ataques-contra-hezbollah-en-libano</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-empleo-tecnologia-de-palantir-en-ataques-contra-hezbollah-en-libano</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 14:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un estudio conjunto de la Universidad de Salamanca y EHU investiga las causas de la muerte de Miguel de Unamuno]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Universidad de Salamanca ha puesto en marcha un estudio interdisciplinar para esclarecer las circunstancias de la muerte de Miguel de Unamuno, ocurrida el 31 de diciembre de 1936 mientras estaba bajo arresto domiciliario impuesto por el régimen franquista.

El objetivo es revisar los indicios de criminalidad y las incoherencias históricas en torno al fallecimiento del escritor, que tuvo lugar en circunstancias sospechosas mientras se encontraba acompañado por el falangista Bartolomé Aragón.

El hasta ahora regidor comunicó su decisión a la dirección provincial del PSOE de Córdoba y también solicitó la baja como militante del partido. La dimisión llega después de que el diario ABC publicara conversaciones y fotografías en las que el exalcalde enviaba mensajes de contenido sexual a una mujer, entre ellos uno con un lenguaje ofensivo. Fernández ha reconocido que los mensajes fueron inapropiados y que se trató de un error de juicio, aunque rechazó que sus palabras y actitudes fuesen de carácter acosador. En su carta de renuncia, lamentó haber causado malestar, pidió disculpas a los vecinos y asumió su responsabilidad por un comportamiento que, según él mismo, no estaba a la altura del cargo que desempeñaba.

Palabras como 'inmarcesible', 'acendrado', 'abracadabrante' o 'vulpino' se destacan por su historia, significado y riqueza expresiva, aunque hoy apenas se empleen en la comunicación cotidiana. Cada término es explicado con detalle, desde su origen etimológico hasta su aplicación en contextos literarios, filosóficos o cotidianos, mostrando la complejidad y belleza del idioma. Por ejemplo, 'inmarcesible' describe aquello que no se marchita, mientras 'acendrado' alude a la pureza refinada de un metal o de una conducta. 'Ecdótico' se refiere al arte de editar textos antiguos, y 'trapisonda' designa un alboroto o pelea con confusión.

La historia de Nicole, una madre de cinco hijos de Gran Manchester, ilustra cómo incluso familias con ingresos regulares deben recurrir a bancos de alimentos para cubrir sus necesidades básicas. Según datos oficiales, 14,2 millones de personas viven por debajo del umbral de pobreza tras pagar los costes de vivienda, y 4,5 millones de niños pertenecen a hogares con bajos ingresos, el 31% del total nacional. Organizaciones como Child Poverty Action Group y Trussell Trust alertan de que esta situación podría empeorar si no se eliminan las restricciones al acceso a ayudas sociales.

El conductor trató de cargar gas natural comprimido (GNC) en un vehículo diseñado para funcionar con gas licuado de petróleo (GLP). Al intentar forzar la conexión del suministro, dañó el depósito, que no estaba preparado para soportar la alta presión del GNC, lo que provocó una deflagración.

En su primera reunión con los empleados de VMware, rechazó mantener beneficios como guarderías, ayudas al bienestar, servicios de terapia o comidas gratuitas, justificándolo con una frase que se haría viral: «No soy vuestro papá».

Durante un episodio emitido el domingo, Welch calificó a Erika Kirk de “estafadora” e “hipócrita” y se refirió a Charlie Kirk como un “racista” y “homófobo sin arrepentimiento”, comentarios que rápidamente se viralizaron y generaron una intensa reacción en redes sociales.

El origen del enfrentamiento está en unas declaraciones previas de Erika Kirk durante un acto organizado por The New York Times, en el que afirmó que muchas mujeres jóvenes votan a candidatos progresistas porque buscan que el Estado sustituya a las relaciones personales y familiares.

En 2024, los productos de menos de 150 euros provenientes de China alcanzaron un valor de 4.600 millones de euros, duplicando la cifra del año anterior.

La resolución, firmada por el ministro Pablo Bustinduy, considera probadas seis infracciones muy graves y una grave, derivadas de prácticas que vulneran los derechos de los consumidores. La investigación se originó tras una denuncia presentada por FACUA en 2023, en la que se señalaban irregularidades como la obligación a los arrendatarios de pagar el equivalente a un mes de renta más el 21% de IVA, además de un coste adicional por un servicio de atención al inquilino.

El tribunal ha declarado prescritos los delitos por los que ambos habían sido condenados previamente a ocho años de prisión por revelación de secretos. Esta decisión revoca la sentencia emitida en mayo de 2025 por la misma Audiencia Nacional, que había considerado probada la obtención indebida de datos, aunque ya entonces absolvió a los exdirectivos de las dos empresas. 

La resolución rechaza asimismo el recurso de la Fiscalía, que pedía penas muy superiores —40 años para Villarejo y 32 años y medio para Redondo— al incluir un delito adicional de cohecho. Los magistrados concluyen que no se ha acreditado relación alguna entre las actividades privadas de Villarejo y el ejercicio de su cargo policial, ni tampoc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-nacional-absuelve-a-villarejo-al-considerar-prescritos-los-delitos-del-caso-repsol-caixabank</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-audiencia-nacional-absuelve-a-villarejo-al-considerar-prescritos-los-delitos-del-caso-repsol-caixabank</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 09:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CIVICUS rebaja la calificación de libertades cívicas en Estados Unidos tras nuevas restricciones gubernamentales]]></title><description><![CDATA[La organización internacional CIVICUS, dedicada a evaluar el estado de las libertades cívicas en el mundo, ha rebajado la calificación de Estados Unidos en su informe anual de 2025, pasando de 'restringido' a 'obstaculizado'. Este descenso refleja un deterioro significativo de las libertades fundamentales en el país, especialmente tras el regreso de Donald Trump a la presidencia en enero de 2025. El informe ‘People Power Under Attack’ señala un aumento sustancial en las violaciones de derechos como la libertad de expresión, asociación y reunión pacífica. Entre los factores más preocupantes, CIVICUS cita el uso de medidas ejecutivas amplias, leyes restrictivas y la intervención militarizada en protestas, con el despliegue de la Guardia Nacional y agentes del ICE en varias ciudades como Los Ángeles.

Según el informe, la primera semana, del 15 al 21 de diciembre, estará condicionada por bajas presiones, lo que traerá lluvias en la mayor parte de la Península y Baleares. Las temperaturas serán inicialmente más altas de lo normal, aunque a partir del martes se espera un descenso notable que dejará heladas nocturnas, sobre todo en zonas del centro y sur peninsular. Para la segunda semana, del 22 al 28 de diciembre, la previsión es más incierta por la distancia temporal, aunque los modelos apuntan a un ambiente más frío de lo habitual y a lluvias escasas en el noroeste, mientras que podrían ser más intensas en el litoral mediterráneo y Baleares.

El 15 de noviembre, mientras las fuerzas rusas avanzaban hacia Myrnohrad, algunos usuarios realizaron apuestas sobre el resultado de la batalla, arriesgando grandes sumas de dinero. Gracias a la modificación del mapa por parte del investigador, que indicaba falsamente que Rusia había tomado un punto clave de la ciudad, los apostadores ganaron enormes cantidades de dinero, aunque Ucrania seguía resistiendo. El ISW aseguró que la edición fue no autorizada y eliminó al responsable de sus registros, pero no confirmó oficialmente si se realizó una investigación interna ni si hubo despido.

Esto supone un crimen machista cada menos de dos días, un ritmo especialmente alarmante coincidiendo con un mes que históricamente registra un aumento de estos casos. El médico forense y exdelegado del Gobierno contra la Violencia de Género, Miguel Lorente, señala que el machismo es el núcleo común en todos los asesinatos, aunque añade factores estacionales como los cambios en las rutinas familiares y la pérdida de control percibida por los agresores durante las fiestas navideñas. También advierte del posible “efecto imitación” entre agresores al ver sucesiones de casos similares en poco tiempo.

Hasta el mes de noviembre se han anunciado 1.170.821 despidos, lo que supone un incremento del 54% respecto a 2024 y marca la sexta ocasión desde 1993 en que los recortes superan el millón de puestos. Aunque en noviembre los anuncios de despidos descendieron a 71.321 respecto a los 153.074 de octubre, las cifras siguen siendo alarmantes. En comparación con el mismo mes de 2022, los despidos aumentaron un 24%. 

Los sectores más afectados han sido el de las telecomunicaciones, con un 17% más de recortes que el año anterior, el agrícola, que creció un 26%, los servicios, con un incremento del 64%, y el comercio minorista, que experimentó un aumento del 139%.

La Fiscalía solicita penas de hasta 16 años y medio de prisión para cada uno de los acusados, al considerar probados delitos de agresión sexual con uso de sustancias y actuación conjunta.

Durante la sesión, los siete acusados negaron los hechos y solo respondieron a las preguntas formuladas por sus abogados defensores. Sus declaraciones fueron breves, de menos de diez minutos cada una. A pesar de estas negaciones, la víctima reconoció a todos ellos como sus agresores durante su testimonio, realizado tras un biombo para preservar su intimidad.

Este acuerdo asegura la continuidad del modelo cooperativo de gestión pública y social que ha sido clave para el empleo y el desarrollo local desde la década de los noventa. El alcalde Sergio Gómez Reyes, presente en la votación, celebró la decisión como un logro histórico fruto de la lucha jornalera iniciada por su predecesor, Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, quien lideró el pueblo durante cuatro décadas.

Pese a la prohibición, Karacsony trató de mantener la marcha al presentarla como un acto municipal, lo que, según él, no requería un permiso formal.

Dos de ellas eran hermanas y todas residían en un albergue cristiano destinado a la atención de niñas en situación de especial vulnerabilidad.

Según las denuncias, los presuntos abusos se produjeron durante la primavera de 2022, cuando el sacerdote acudía al albergue para confesar a las menores y, en ese contexto, habría realizado tocamientos de carácter sexual. Las víctimas decidieron denunciar los hechos después de tener conocimiento de que el religioso había regresado a España.

Según el informe, esta cifra refleja una caída significativa en los precios de las baterías a escala de red, derivada de un abaratamiento del 40 % en los equipos observado en 2024 y de nuevas reducciones durante 2025. Los costes actuales del equipo básico de baterías fabricado en China se sitúan en torno a 75 dólares/kWh, mientras que el coste total instalado a escala de servicio público alcanza unos 125 dólares/kWh. 

Los investigadores de Ember sostienen que estos descensos, junto con mayores eficiencias, vidas útiles más largas y modelos de negocio más claros, han hecho posible que la energía solar deje de ser solo barata durante el día y pase a ser una fuente despachable, es decir, utilizable cuando se necesita.

Leavitt falleció el 12 de diciembre de 1921 sin haber recibido en vida el reconocimiento que merecía, pese a haber formulado una de las leyes más importantes de la astronomía moderna: la relación entre el periodo y la luminosidad de las estrellas variables cefeidas.

A finales del siglo XIX y comienzos del XX, antes de la informática, muchos observatorios empleaban a mujeres como “computadoras humanas”, encargadas de analizar datos astronómicos de forma manual. En el Observatorio de Harvard, este grupo —conocido como las Harvard Computers— desempeñó un papel clave en la catalogación del cielo, aunque con salarios bajos, sin acceso a telescopios y con escaso reconocimiento académico. En ese contexto, Leavitt desarrolló su trabajo desde un puesto subordinado y bajo condicion]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/henrietta-swan-leavitt-y-la-ley-que-permitio-medir-las-distancias-del-universo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/henrietta-swan-leavitt-y-la-ley-que-permitio-medir-las-distancias-del-universo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 04:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez es elegido 'persona del año' por L’Espresso, símbolo del progresismo en Italia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro español, Pedro Sánchez, ha sido elegido 'persona del año' por el semanario progresista italiano L’Espresso, que le dedica su portada y una extensa entrevista. Esta distinción llega respaldada por una encuesta del instituto Censis, que sitúa a Sánchez como el líder internacional mejor valorado por los italianos, con un 44,9 % de apoyo, solo superado por el Papa León XIV. El reconocimiento refleja el creciente interés de la izquierda italiana por las políticas sociales y el enfoque internacional del presidente español, considerado un referente progresista en un momento en el que Italia carece de figuras inspiradoras. En ese contexto, se alude a Sánchez como el nuevo 'papa extranjero', un papel que en el pasado desempeñó José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. 

L’Espresso destaca el contraste entre la gestión de Sánchez y la del Gobierno de Giorgia Meloni, subrayando las tensiones entre ambos por decisiones como el reconocimiento del Estado palestino o la negativa española a aum]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-es-elegido-persona-del-ano-por-l-espresso-simbolo-del-progresismo-en-italia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-es-elegido-persona-del-ano-por-l-espresso-simbolo-del-progresismo-en-italia</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 04:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[¡Consiga ya su Nobel de la Paz! ¡Cualquiera puede ganarlo!]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo es una sátira al estilo de un infomercial que se burla de la aparente facilidad con la que algunas figuras políticas reciben el Premio Nobel de la Paz, mencionando a personas como María Corina Machado, Juan Manuel Santos, Henry Kissinger o Barack Obama.

La canadiense Nutrien cerró la venta del 50% de su participación en Profertil, la mayor productora de fertilizantes del país, a Adecoagro y la Asociación de Cooperativas Argentinas (ACA) por 600 millones de dólares. Con esta operación, las firmas compradoras refuerzan su posición en el suministro de insumos agrícolas clave, mientras Nutrien redirige sus inversiones hacia 'geografías estratégicas'.

A este movimiento se suma el cierre de la planta de Whirlpool en Pilar, donde la multinacional estadounidense anunció el despido de 220 empleados y el cese de producción debido a la caída del consumo interno y el aumento de importaciones. Pese a ello, la empresa mantendrá sus operaciones comerciales en el país.

Por su parte, la brasileña Raízen, controladora de la marca Shell en Argentina, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/empresas-internacionales-reducen-su-presencia-en-argentina-ante-la-incertidumbre-economica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/empresas-internacionales-reducen-su-presencia-en-argentina-ante-la-incertidumbre-economica</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sanciones a manifestantes en la ULL por protestar contra Vito Quiles, pese a haber comunicado la concentración]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Delegación del Gobierno en Canarias ha impuesto sanciones económicas a los organizadores de la manifestación que tuvo lugar en la Universidad de La Laguna (ULL) contra la presencia del activista de extrema derecha Vito Quiles. Según fuentes policiales, las multas, que rondan los 50 euros por persona y alcanzan los 150 euros en algunos casos, se justifican por la supuesta falta de comunicación previa de la protesta a las autoridades. No obstante, el rector de la ULL ha afirmado públicamente que la manifestación fue comunicada conforme a los cauces legales establecidos. La Delegación de Gobierno plantea extender las sanciones no solo a los organizadores del acto, sino también a todos los participantes, incluidos miembros del grupo de Quiles, al considerar los hechos una 'revuelta no autorizada'. El conflicto ha reavivado el debate sobre el derecho de reunión y manifestación en entornos universitarios, así como sobre el papel de las autoridades en la gestión de eventos con alta carga i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sanciones-a-manifestantes-en-la-ull-por-protestar-contra-vito-quiles-pese-a-haber-comunicado-la-concentracion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sanciones-a-manifestantes-en-la-ull-por-protestar-contra-vito-quiles-pese-a-haber-comunicado-la-concentracion</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 03:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tucker Carlson denuncia las muertes de niños palestinos y ataques a periodistas en Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia recoge las declaraciones del comentarista ultraconservador estadounidense Tucker Carlson sobre la ofensiva israelí en Gaza y sus consecuencias para la población civil palestina, especialmente los menores. Según el texto, Carlson afirma que Israel ha matado de forma deliberada a decenas de miles de niños y que, además, habría cerrado las salidas de Gaza mientras disparaba contra numerosos periodistas para impedir que documentaran lo que ocurría sobre el terreno. El comentarista sostiene que, en su opinión, esta estrategia habría permitido a Israel arrasar la franja, expulsar a la población y tomar el control del territorio sin que quedara constancia visual suficiente de los hechos.
La pieza también relata la visita de Carlson a un centro en Qatar donde se atiende a niños palestinos heridos por los bombardeos israelíes, experiencia que describe como profundamente impactante.

En una entrevista en El Partidazo de COPE, la campeona de Wimbledon y Roland Garros explicó que las discrepancias van más allá de la potencia: «La superioridad de los hombres no se basa solo en la fuerza, sino también en la resistencia física y la musculatura». Muguruza comentó que, durante su mejor momento como número 1 del mundo, no habría podido vencer ni siquiera a un jugador junior, recordando además que en su etapa de entrenamiento no logró imponerse a sus compañeros masculinos, incluso si no eran profesionales. Estas palabras han provocado debate dentro del tenis, dividiendo a quienes aplauden su sinceridad y aquellos que creen que declaraciones así perjudican la imagen del circuito femenino. Más allá de la polémica, Muguruza defendió que el tenis masculino y femenino deben valo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/garbine-muguruza-reconoce-las-diferencias-fisicas-entre-el-tenis-masculino-y-femenino-y-aboga-por-entenderlos-como-espectaculos-distintos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/garbine-muguruza-reconoce-las-diferencias-fisicas-entre-el-tenis-masculino-y-femenino-y-aboga-por-entenderlos-como-espectaculos-distintos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 02:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei y SMIC logran fabricar un chip de 5 nm sin acceso a tecnología EUV]]></title><description><![CDATA[Huawei y su socio tecnológico SMIC han alcanzado un hito importante en la industria de los semiconductores al desarrollar el procesador Kirin 9030, utilizado en la nueva serie de teléfonos Huawei Mate 80. A pesar de las restricciones impuestas por Estados Unidos, que impiden a China acceder a las avanzadas máquinas de litografía ultravioleta extrema (EUV) de la empresa europea ASML, ambas compañías han conseguido producir un chip funcional de 5 nanómetros utilizando tecnología más antigua basada en litografía ultravioleta profunda (DUV) y técnicas de multipatrón. El análisis técnico realizado por TechInsights confirma que el Kirin 9030 está fabricado con el proceso N+3 de SMIC, que supone un avance significativo respecto al nodo N+2 de 7 nanómetros empleado en versiones previas como los Kirin 9000S, 9010 y 9020. Aunque este nuevo proceso no alcanza la densidad de integración de los chips de 5 nm de fabricantes como TSMC o Samsung, demuestra que China puede seguir reduciendo el tamaño d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/huawei-y-smic-logran-fabricar-un-chip-de-5-nm-sin-acceso-a-tecnologia-euv</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/huawei-y-smic-logran-fabricar-un-chip-de-5-nm-sin-acceso-a-tecnologia-euv</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 01:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Charlie McGettigan se suma a la protesta contra Eurovisión y anuncia la devolución de su trofeo de 1994]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Festival de Eurovisión atraviesa una de las mayores crisis institucionales de su historia reciente tras la polémica generada por la participación de Israel en la última edición del certamen. La controversia, que ya había provocado tensiones internas en la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER), se ha intensificado después de que varios países expresaran su rechazo a la continuidad de Israel en futuras ediciones. España, Irlanda, Eslovenia, Países Bajos, Islandia y Suiza llegaron incluso a abandonar el certamen como gesto de protesta, mientras que en otros países, como Grecia o Portugal, se abrieron debates parlamentarios y campañas ciudadanas para seguir el mismo camino.

En este contexto, el gesto del representante suizo Nemo, ganador de Eurovisión 2024 con la canción ‘The Code’, supuso un punto de inflexión.

Esta herramienta, denominada Video Recaps, había comenzado a probarse recientemente en varias series seleccionadas y tenía como objetivo ofrecer vídeos breves que resumieran los puntos clave de la trama mediante una voz sintética y fragmentos de la propia serie, facilitando así el acceso a nuevas temporadas.

El problema surgió cuando el resumen de Fallout incluyó fallos claros de comprensión del argumento. Entre los más destacados, la IA situó erróneamente un flashback del personaje de The Ghoul en la América de los años cincuenta, cuando en realidad ocurre en el año 2077, un dato fundamental dentro del universo narrativo de la serie. Además, el recap simplificó en exceso una decisión crucial de la protagonista, Lucy MacLean, afirmando que se le]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-retira-los-resumenes-automaticos-con-ia-de-prime-video-tras-errores-narrativos-en-fallout</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/amazon-retira-los-resumenes-automaticos-con-ia-de-prime-video-tras-errores-narrativos-en-fallout</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 00:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
