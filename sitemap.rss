Initially drafted when Isaacman was a leading candidate for NASA Administrator under President Trump, the document proposes deep structural changes across NASA centers and bold measures for lunar and Mars missions. Project Athena supports canceling the SLS rocket after the Artemis III mission while aiming to accelerate lunar landings to beat China. It suggests using SpaceX’s Starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn as alternatives to the SLS. 

In addition to lunar operations, the proposal outlines a Mars exploration initiative called Project Olympus, envisioned as a partnership with SpaceX to send multiple uncrewed Starships to Mars by 2026, establishing an initial base called Mars Discovery Base. A major emphasis in the document is on developing nuclear fission technology for both energy generation and propulsion (NEP s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jared-isaacman-s-project-athena-a-radical-plan-to-restructure-nasa-s-future-lunar-and-mars-programs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jared-isaacman-s-project-athena-a-radical-plan-to-restructure-nasa-s-future-lunar-and-mars-programs</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 12:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Black leader criticizes immigrant Trump voters after immigration protection cuts]]></title><description><![CDATA[The recent decision by the Trump administration to end immigration protections for Haitians has sparked outrage within the migrant community. Felicia Persaud, a Caribbean-U.S.-based journalist, argues that this policy change is partly driven by pro-Trump immigrant voters who helped elect the former president. The termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti is particularly impactful, as more than 500,000 Haitian immigrants in the U.S. face deportation after the policy expires in February 2026. Additionally, the Trump administration's review of Green Card holders from 19 countries, mostly non-white majority nations, signals a continued stance against immigrants of color. Persaud specifically targets the Haitian, Cuban, Somali, Venezuelan, and Hispanic immigrant groups who voted for Trump despite his xenophobic rhetoric. She warns that those who helped elect him are now facing the consequences of their support.

Dan highlighted that although the state often appears unwilling to effectively combat corruption, the situation has improved compared to twenty years ago. He criticized corrupt individuals who appear on television giving moral lessons, which further fuels public outrage. Despite acknowledging setbacks such as declining living standards from the previous year and persistent weaknesses in public systems like education and healthcare, Dan also pointed out some progress. This includes infrastructure developments such as the construction of 500 kilometers of highways and new hospital buildings funded by EU programs. Furthermore, Dan referenced the cancellation of the 2024 presidential elections as a damaging event raising questions about Romania's democratic stability, men]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/romanian-president-nicuor-dan-acknowledges-ongoing-corruption-but-notes-some-progress</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/romanian-president-nicuor-dan-acknowledges-ongoing-corruption-but-notes-some-progress</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 09:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miebo: How a European $20 Eye Drop Became an $800 Prescription in the U.S.]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article exposes the extreme price disparity between an over-the-counter European eye drop and its costly U.S. counterpart. In Europe, EvoTears has been available since 2015 for around $20, while its U.S. version, Miebo—produced by Bausch & Lomb—costs over $800 per month. The piece argues that this discrepancy stems not from regulatory necessity, but from deliberate corporate manipulation of American drug approval laws. After obtaining exclusive rights to the drug in 2019, Bausch & Lomb chose to seek FDA approval as a prescription drug rather than pursue over-the-counter status. This decision allowed the company to patent the product, limit competition, and set exorbitant prices. Miebo’s sales exceeded $170 million in its first full year, far surpassing projections. The company’s justification—that FDA classification required rigorous testing—sidesteps the fact that the FDA’s criteria for nonprescription approval center on patient safety without doctor supervision, a threshold the p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miebo-how-a-european-20-eye-drop-became-an-800-prescription-in-the-u-s</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/miebo-how-a-european-20-eye-drop-became-an-800-prescription-in-the-u-s</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 03:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI, Labor Cuts, and the Contradictions of Capitalism: The Telefónica Case]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming capitalist production and labor relations, using Telefónica’s massive layoff plan as a case study. It argues that AI not only replaces manual labor but also intellectual and creative work, pushing production costs toward zero while exposing capitalism’s structural contradictions. Telefónica’s plan to cut nearly 6,000 jobs in Spain—representing about a quarter of its workforce—forms part of a wider strategy to achieve efficiency, reduce debt, and redirect resources toward AI and cybersecurity. The move, however, signals a deeper shift: the company is replacing human control with data-driven management ('dataism'), maximizing profits through algorithmic oversight of labor and consumer behavior. 

The article contends that this technological progress, while capable of producing material abundance, is being used to increase inequality rather than to improve collective welfare.

According to video taken by Miami Herald reporter David Goodhue, several masked agents pulled the screaming woman from her car near Pink Plaza at Mile Marker 103.4. In the footage, she repeatedly shouted that she was a U.S. citizen and pleaded for help as agents placed her in handcuffs. Goodhue stated that the encounter began with officers apparently asking for her identification. When she failed to produce it, the situation escalated quickly. A Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy was seen directing traffic while federal agents surrounded the vehicle. Witnesses said the agencies involved appeared to be ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and Border Patrol, with the sheriff’s office only providing support for public safety.

The law mandates that every Texas public school classroom display the King James version of the Ten Commandments. Federal courts have already deemed the measure unconstitutional in prior rulings, but Attorney General Ken Paxton continues to urge districts to ignore those decisions and put up the displays. 

The new lawsuit, titled *Ashby v. Schertz-Cibolo-Universal ISD*, seeks to prevent all Texas school districts not yet involved in litigation from installing or maintaining these religious posters. Plaintiffs argue that pursuing individual cases district by district has become impractical given there are over 1,000 districts, more than 4,200 schools, and millions of students potentially exposed to these un]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/texas-families-seek-nationwide-injunction-against-unconstitutional-ten-commandments-displays-in-schools</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/texas-families-seek-nationwide-injunction-against-unconstitutional-ten-commandments-displays-in-schools</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 02:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oliver Bulleid and His Experimental Steam Locomotives: The Leader and the Turf Burner]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article by Juan Manuel Grijalvo delves into the experimental spirit of engineer Oliver Bulleid, renowned for challenging the conventions of steam locomotive design as the age of steam power declined. Bulleid, famous for his bold ideas in British railways, ventured beyond traditional mechanical approaches in search of modernization. The piece begins with the 'Leader', a steam locomotive that appeared diesel-like due to its body design. Equipped with two driving cabs and twin sets of steam engines linked by roller chains, it represented a radical departure from standard steam technology. Despite its technical innovations—such as an efficient steam generator—the design suffered a severe flaw: its fireman worked in oppressive, unventilated heat exceeding fifty degrees Celsius. Strong union opposition to such working conditions led to abandonment of the project. 

After the 'Leader' failure, Bulleid moved to Ireland, where Córas Iompair Éireann commissioned him to design a locomotive th]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oliver-bulleid-and-his-experimental-steam-locomotives-the-leader-and-the-turf-burner</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/oliver-bulleid-and-his-experimental-steam-locomotives-the-leader-and-the-turf-burner</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 01:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[National Park Service Revises Free-Entry Days and Introduces International Visitor Fee in 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Starting January 1, 2026, the National Park Service (NPS) will implement significant changes to its fee structure and free-entry policies. International visitors without an annual pass will be required to pay $100 per person to enter the 11 most-visited national parks under the new 'America-first' initiative. For U.S. citizens and residents, several federal holidays will remain as free-entry days, while Juneteenth and Martin Luther King Jr. Day will no longer offer complimentary admission. New 'patriotic fee-free days' include President Donald Trump's birthday on June 14, Independence Day weekend (July 3–5), and the 110th birthday of the NPS on August 25. Other free-entry days for Americans include President’s Day, Memorial Day, Constitution Day, Theodore Roosevelt’s birthday, and Veterans Day.

Millions of Ukrainians have fled the country since the onset of the war in February 2022, joining a long-standing diaspora that spans over 20 million people across more than 50 countries. Historically, Ukrainian emigration has occurred in waves, including late 19th-century agricultural migration to the Americas, post-World War II migration of Nazi collaborators to North America and Western Europe, and economic migration after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. Today, the diaspora contributes significantly to Ukraine's economy through remittances, which reached $17 billion in 2022 according to the World Bank, representing a crucial stabilizing force amid ongoing conflict. Countries hosting Ukrainian refugees, such as Poland, also benefit economically, with contributions to GDP estimated between 0.5 and 2.4 percentage points.

In 2025, while global debates around AI’s risks and promises continued, India took decisive action, allocating large investments into GPUs, startups, education, and digital inclusion programs. This national effort aims to make AI a natural part of everyday life by 2026, fostering technological self-sufficiency and local innovation. The strategy relies on three core pillars: robust infrastructure, talent development, and inclusive technology adoption. By building its own computing capacity and promoting sovereign innovation, India seeks independence from foreign technological dependence.

It argues that Mexico has the talent and creativity needed for AI development but lacks a cohesive national strategy, sufficient infrastructure, and financial support for]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-s-artificial-intelligence-strategy-offers-mexico-a-roadmap-for-inclusive-innovation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-s-artificial-intelligence-strategy-offers-mexico-a-roadmap-for-inclusive-innovation</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 21:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Croatian Nun Hospitalized After Self-Inflicted Injuries]]></title><description><![CDATA[On December 3, 2025, Croatian media reported that 35-year-old nun Marija Tajana Zrno, known as Sister Zrno, had been stabbed in the Malesnica residential area of Zagreb. Initial reports sensationalized the incident, claiming the attacker shouted religious phrases and implying a foreign assailant, which stirred public concern. However, police investigations quickly revealed that the nun had purchased the knife herself and that her abdominal injuries were self-inflicted and superficial. No evidence of an outside attacker was found on surveillance footage. Sister Zrno is a well-known religious educator and football enthusiast in Croatia, having hosted programs on Catholic television and organized prayer initiatives for the Croatian national football team. Following the incident, she has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. The authorities have filed a report against her, highlighting the incident as a case of self-harm rather than an external assault.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/croatian-nun-hospitalized-after-self-inflicted-injuries</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/croatian-nun-hospitalized-after-self-inflicted-injuries</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 19:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Venezuela's Strategic Use of Asymmetric Defense Against Technologically Superior Forces]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes Venezuela's strategic approach to modern asymmetric warfare, emphasizing that technological superiority alone does not guarantee victory. Western military planners have long assumed that dominance in GPS, satellite navigation, and digital mapping ensures operational control. However, Venezuela has focused on exploiting asymmetry rather than competing in technological parity. The country has developed systems capable of spoofing, interfering with, and rendering foreign geolocation tools unreliable, thereby disrupting precision in navigation, target designation, and coordinated military operations. Venezuelan defense doctrine prioritizes dispersal, camouflage, and environmental integration, leveraging forests, mountains, urban areas, and coastal regions to complicate adversaries’ reliance on satellite intelligence. By controlling the cognitive perception of terrain, Venezuela can neutralize superior forces, turning their technology into a vulnerability.

According to the report, Von der Leyen is allegedly using several tactics: declaring a financial emergency specific to Ukraine, framing support for Ukraine as existential for the EU, extending sanctions against Russia permanently, mandating financial institutions like Euroclear to release Russian assets, and approving key legal measures through qualified majority voting to bypass potential vetoes from member states such as Belgium. The article questions the legality of invoking Article 122 of the EU Treaty, which is designed to provide financial aid to EU member states in exceptional circumstances, highlighting that Ukraine is not a member.

This breakthrough builds on years of work since the Higgs boson was first confirmed in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new study, published in *Physical Review Letters*, combines data from the last two ATLAS runs, achieving a significance level of 3.4 standard deviations—an improvement over the 3.0 level previously reached by the CMS experiment. 

This finding is crucial because it probes how the Higgs field gives mass to particles. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson’s interactions with particles, known as Yukawa couplings, determine their mass. While earlier studies confirmed these interactions for heavier third-generation particles such as top and bottom quarks and tau leptons, the new result strengthens evidence for the coupling to second-generation fermions like m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/atlas-collaboration-finds-strong-evidence-of-higgs-boson-decaying-into-muon-antimuon-pair</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/atlas-collaboration-finds-strong-evidence-of-higgs-boson-decaying-into-muon-antimuon-pair</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 16:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gender-Based Violence Rises in Argentina Amid Milei’s Rollback of Women’s Rights]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the worsening crisis of gender-based violence in Argentina under President Javier Milei. It opens with the murder of Fernanda Soledad Yramain, a young mother from Tucumán who repeatedly sought police protection from her violent partner before being killed in 2024. Her case exemplifies what many activists see as a systemic collapse of safeguards for women. Since taking office in December 2023, Milei’s administration has dismantled institutions and programs aimed at preventing and addressing violence against women, such as the Ministry of Women and the Acompañar program. Funding cuts have led to reduced staff on emergency hotlines and fewer prosecutorial offices dedicated to gender violence cases. Data from the province of Tucumán show a sharp decline in protection orders and an increase in femicides. Nationally, 295 femicides were recorded in 2024, with a surge in early 2025. Critics, including feminist lawyers and Amnesty International, warn that Milei’s government]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gender-based-violence-rises-in-argentina-amid-milei-s-rollback-of-women-s-rights</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gender-based-violence-rises-in-argentina-amid-milei-s-rollback-of-women-s-rights</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI and Robotics Are Transforming Scientific Research and Mexico’s Role in It]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores how artificial intelligence and robotics are rapidly reshaping global scientific research, particularly through their integration into laboratory environments.

Led by Enric Vilajosana, Miquel Àngel Fullana, and Joaquim Raduà, the study analyzed data from 42 previous experiments involving over 2,199 participants worldwide. They found that earlier inconsistencies in identifying brain areas involved in fear learning were due to limited statistical power rather than actual biological differences. By combining all available data, the team revealed that fear learning activates several interconnected brain regions, including the insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor areas, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, caudate, and parts of the midbrain. Simultaneously, areas linked to the brain’s default mode network showed decreased activity, reflecting a shift of attention toward potential threats.

Telefónica presents its workforce reduction as part of a strategic efficiency plan to cut debt and reallocate €3 billion by 2030 toward emerging sectors like AI and cybersecurity. However, the piece argues that this shift exposes deeper systemic issues: AI, while capable of producing abundance by automating work and optimizing resources, is deployed instead to preserve profitability and the capitalist order. Rather than being used to reduce working hours or redistribute productivity gains, technological advances are driving unemployment and social inequality.

He highlighted Washington’s continued purchase of uranium from Russia, which fuels American nuclear power plants, while at the same time urging New Delhi to reduce its imports of Russian oil. Putin pointed out the inconsistency in the US position, stating that if America has the right to buy fuel from Russia, India should enjoy the same privilege. Russia currently supplies about a quarter of the uranium used in US reactors, with estimated sales of $1.2 billion in 2025, up from $800 million in 2024.

The controversy grew with an opinion piece by Joren Vermeersch, an advisor to the Belgian Defense Minister, who insulted France and argued that rejecting American weapons would marginalize Europe strategically. Recently, the first F-35 arrived in Belgium, but it faced technical problems, and the country's limited airspace caused further complications. Belgium's airspace is among the most restricted in Europe, making it difficult to conduct the necessary training for such advanced jets. The Belgian government is now seeking agreements with NATO allies like Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands to access broader training areas.

The reason is the ongoing 'AI bubble,' which has caused unprecedented demand for high-performance memory used in artificial intelligence data centers. With data center companies willing to pay premium prices, chipmakers such as Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are channeling resources toward that market segment. 

Samsung Electronics, responsible for Galaxy devices, reportedly had to renegotiate short-term contracts at significantly increased prices after attempts to secure long-term supply agreements were rejected.

Born in Japan and partly raised on U.S. military bases, Tagawa moved to Los Angeles where he developed his own martial arts style, Chu Shin. Discovered by director Bernardo Bertolucci, he gained international recognition with a role in the 1987 Oscar-winning film 'The Last Emperor,' and went on to appear in over 30 films. Tagawa often portrayed elegant and cunning villains, becoming a staple of action cinema. Beyond his film work, he served as a mentor to younger actors and martial artists, known for his generosity and charisma. His role as Shang Tsung became a cult classic, remembered for the line 'Your soul is mine,' and he reprised the character in the 2013 series 'Mortal Kombat: Legacy' and voiced him in the video game 'Mortal Kombat 11.'

The continent holds vast reserves of key minerals—lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, manganese, and rare earth elements—placing it at the crossroads of global industrial and political ambitions. The Democratic Republic of the Congo alone accounts for over 76% of the world’s cobalt supply, while Zimbabwe, Mali, and South Africa also host abundant reserves of lithium and other critical resources. China currently dominates the extraction, refining, and processing sectors, controlling up to 70% of global lithium and cobalt production chains. Its Belt and Road investments amount to more than $29 billion, much of it directed to mining infrastructure.

However, an investigation by the Dutch newspaper Trouw and the magazine Dronewatch analyzed 61 incidents across 11 countries between September 9 and November 27 and concluded that the vast majority lacked any tangible evidence of drones or foreign interference. Of those 61 sightings, 14 turned out to be other objects such as police helicopters or cargo planes, 41 had no verifiable proof or clear origin, while only three confirmed Russian drones were located in countries bordering Ukraine—Poland, Romania, and Moldova. This evidence does not substantiate claims of coordinated Russian activity in Western Europe.

The woman, visibly distressed, shouted that she was a U.S. citizen and pleaded for help as agents handcuffed her. Witnesses, including Goodhue, described the event as both shocking and unnecessary, saying the situation escalated after officers apparently asked for identification that she did not have on hand.

Local and Israeli media outlets reported the death, though details on the perpetrator remain unclear, with some accounts suggesting an internal clash or shooting involving local families. Abu Shabab, a 35-year-old with a criminal background including convictions for theft and drug trafficking, escaped Hamas prison during early Israeli strikes and rebuilt his operations in eastern Rafah with Israeli arms, air cover, and coordination. His group faced widespread condemnation from Palestinian factions for looting humanitarian aid convoys, extorting civilians, attacking Palestinians, and alleged ties to ISIS, while aiding Israel's efforts against Hamas.

Out of all UN member states, only fifteen countries — including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, and Israel — signed a joint declaration condemning China’s alleged abuses in Xinjiang. China’s counter-declaration, titled 'Opposition to the Politicization of Human Rights,' gathered 85 signatories, representing roughly half of the global population.

The report emphasizes that most Muslim-majority nations, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, and Pakistan, chose to support China's stance instead of the U.S.-led declaration, revealing a major shift in diplomatic alignment.

The initiative allows NATO countries to jointly fund the purchase of U.S. weapons for Ukrainian defense. Tajani explained that if peace talks succeed and hostilities end, there will be no need for additional arms, but rather for security guarantees and reconstruction measures.

These activists, imprisoned for attacking British arms factories supplying weapons to Israel, have been retroactively labeled as 'terrorists' under the UK’s expansive anti-terrorism legislation after the government banned their organization. Their protest aims to draw attention to what they consider illegal imprisonment and complicity in genocide in Gaza.

Cook contrasts the current silence with the 1980s IRA hunger strikes, which received broad and sustained media attention. He argues that today’s corporate and state-aligned press avoids coverage that might embarrass the government or expose repression against political dissent.

It begins by referencing a statement from historian Irving Abella, who noted that in postwar Canada, having an SS tattoo could serve as proof of being anti-communist—something valued during the Cold War. The text links this attitude to a broader Western pattern of sheltering fascist and Nazi collaborators after World War II, citing examples such as Otto Skorzeny and Stefano Delle Chiaie in Spain.

The piece focuses heavily on Canada’s admission of Ukrainian members of the Waffen-SS Galicia Division and the controversial 2023 parliamentary tribute to Yaroslav Hunka, a veteran of that division.

The decision followed new U.S. sanctions targeting groups cooperating with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has been investigating Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes.

The second stage successfully reached orbit with a simulated payload, achieving an initial orbit of 142 x 402 km at a 56.95° inclination. However, the first stage failed to land on its dedicated platform 390 km away, experiencing an explosion during the final landing burn. Despite the setback, the stage reached an apogee of 120 km and performed a 46-second braking burn, demonstrating significant progress for a private Chinese aerospace company.

The government is under pressure from Europe regarding Russian-held funds, while internally it struggles to function as a coalition of five disparate parties. Workers and pensioners staged a three-day strike, marking the largest mobilization since the famous 1960-1961 'Strike of the Century.' The strikes reflect growing dissatisfaction with working conditions and the government's austerity policies, which prioritize budget cuts over social welfare. The article compares current events to the historic strike, highlighting the political nature of past labor movements that opposed both government austerity and broader structural inequalities.

Initially, it seemed successful, but the policy quickly backfired. Hunters often cut off tails and released the rats to breed more, while some even raised rats deliberately for profit. This perverse incentive caused the rat population to increase, exposing hunters to greater plague risk and undermining public health efforts. The broader context involved unequal urban planning: European quarters received modern sewers, while Vietnamese neighborhoods were left with open gutters, exacerbating rat infestations. Experts highlight this as an early example of Goodhart’s Law, showing how poorly designed incentives can lead to unintended consequences. Modern parallels exist, such as bounties on rodents or invasive species in Jakarta and South Dakota, which similarly risk encouraging exploitation rather than solving the problem.

EU safety standards have been credited with reducing European road deaths by 36% since 2010, while US road deaths rose by 30% in the same period, with significant increases in pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. European regulations mandate life-saving technologies such as pedestrian protection, automated emergency braking, and lane-keeping assistance.

Gardner photographed the toad and the image was published in The Hamilton Spectator, quickly gaining attention in both Canada and the United States. The toad's unusual appearance baffled scientists, but it has been confirmed as a real phenomenon known as a macromutation. This type of mutation can significantly alter an organism's structure, and in amphibians, it sometimes affects limbs or other body parts. In this case, the mutation caused the toad's eye sockets to be absent, resulting in the eyes growing from its palate. While the exact cause of such mutations remains unclear, scientists suspect a parasitic trematode infection may play a role. Despite its strange appearance, the toad can live a normal life, as its eyes remain functional.

The piece details NATO’s increasing aggressiveness, citing potential preemptive strikes on Moscow and ongoing maritime drone attacks against Russian cargo ships allegedly orchestrated by British military personnel in Ukraine.

Poch explains that contacts between Putin and U.S. envoys—specifically Donald Trump’s associates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner—reflect internal divisions within the American establishment about how to handle Russia.

The author argues that the formal conclusion of the conflict could arrive by spring or summer, yet warns that this will not be a true end.

The testimony alleges a systemic 'kill policy' by the UK Special Forces unit UKSF1 and describes cover-ups by senior commanders and a failure to properly investigate these war crimes. The inquiry revealed incidents where the number of enemy killed far exceeded weapons recovered, casting doubt on official reports. A particularly disturbing case cited was the shooting of two young children and their parents during a nighttime raid in Nimruz province in 2012. The officer described a culture within UKSF1 of casual killings and data manipulation to conceal unlawful acts.

The factory, located in Komsilga, was reopened following an overhaul, and is set to produce 600,000 hectoliters annually. The reopening marks a significant step in utilizing local raw materials like maize, sorghum, and rice, essential to the country's agriculture. The rehabilitation, costing over 17 billion CFA francs, also brings new job opportunities, with 300 direct jobs and an expected 20,000 indirect jobs across sectors such as logistics, distribution, and agriculture. President Ibrahim Traoré expressed his pride, calling the reopening a victory against imperialism and a symbol of the resilience of Burkina Faso's people.

Originally purchased in 2002 by a Qatari prince for $9.6 million, it sold at Christie’s London for £22.9 million ($30.2 million), surpassing expectations. Out of the 50 Fabergé Imperial Eggs commissioned for Russian Tsarinas, only 44 survive today, with just six held privately. Designed by Alma Pihl, granddaughter of Fabergé’s workmaster, the Winter Egg is adorned with more than 3,200 rose-cut diamonds and intricately carved rock crystal, platinum, nephrite, and gold details. Its hidden surprise—a platinum and diamond trellis basket containing quartz wood anemones and garnets—is emblematic of Fabergé’s signature craftsmanship. The egg’s design was inspired by the snowflakes seen through Pihl’s workshop window and is part of the Winter Jewels series, initially created for Swedish-Russian tycoon Emanuel Nobel.

The bird, listed as red by the RSPB due to its declining population in the UK, was discovered shivering under a hot tub step on the 16th deck by Charlene Halsey and her daughters. Observing its distress, the family took the bird into their cabin, kept it warm, and cared for it overnight. They named it Aaron Burrd after the musical Hamilton. Once the ship docked, Derek Davey, a specialist in seabird rescue and rehabilitation, took responsibility for the corncrake. He noted that the bird likely boarded the ship while it was in the Mediterranean and highlighted the challenges of providing suitable overwintering conditions before the corncrake can return north to its breeding grounds. Corncrakes are highly secretive birds, primarily living in tall grass, with a distinctive 'crex crex' call.

It begins by explaining the etymology of the word 'apple,' tracing it back to the Latin term 'malum' and the Roman botanist Gaius Matius, whose cultivated variety influenced the modern Spanish term. The article then discusses the apple in the context of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden, noting that the original text never specifies the fruit and that the Latin translation by Saint Jerome created the association by using the word 'malum,' which also means 'evil.' Next, the apple's role in Greek mythology is recounted, focusing on the golden apple of discord that sparked the Trojan War. Finally, the story of Snow White is examined, contrasting the Grimm brothers' original dark tale with the more familiar modern version.

In contrast, by 2020, global child mortality had dropped to just 4.3%, with countries like Japan and Norway achieving rates as low as 0.3%. This extraordinary reduction is attributed to advancements in nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and significant decreases in poverty, conflicts, and famine. Personal anecdotes shared by readers illustrate how infant and child mortality was a common experience only a century ago, with multiple generations experiencing the loss of siblings or children. Modern medicine and public health improvements have fundamentally transformed human lifespan, largely by preventing early deaths rather than prolonging life at older ages. Experts argue that investing in public health measures could further enhance global health outcomes.

Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach announced six charges against Ceballos — three for voting without being qualified and three for election perjury — following his reelection in November. The charges stem from Ceballos’s history of voting in U.S. elections since 1991, despite not being a U.S. citizen. According to state prosecutors, these offenses could lead to over five years of imprisonment and fines exceeding $200,000. In addition to the criminal case, the Department of Homeland Security has warned it may initiate deportation proceedings that could send Ceballos back to Mexico, where he has not lived since early childhood.

Despite public praise from city officials, the files show a deep police distrust and covert surveillance driven by alignment with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s hostile views of King as a communist and liar. The New York police engaged in extensive spying, disruption, and sabotage efforts against civil rights activists long before the FBI's infamous COINTELPRO program.

Unlike the two-body problem, the motion of three gravitationally interacting bodies cannot be solved analytically, making numerical simulations essential. The simulator calculates pairwise gravitational forces using Newton's law of universal gravitation and offers a choice of integration methods: the symplectic Velocity Verlet method for long-term energy conservation and the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for short-term accuracy. Users can explore famous preset 2D orbits, including the Figure-8 choreography, Lagrange triangular configuration, and orbits from the Šuvakov-Dmitrašinović database. In addition, the simulator incorporates over 10,000 new 3D periodic orbits discovered by Li and Liao (2025), including choreographic and 'piano-trio' orbits.

However, reports from Palestinian officials, UN agencies, and field data contradict these claims. Since the ceasefire on October 10, only 34% of expected supplies have entered Gaza, with limited humanitarian trucks and fuel shipments. Cooking gas deliveries account for just 15% of the required supply, while diesel fuel deliveries are at only 12% of planned levels. Approximately 9,000 trucks carrying tents and other aid remain blocked outside Gaza, including 6,000 from the UN. Gaza’s urgent need exceeds 300,000 tents, and displaced families are suffering from flooding, cold, and unsanitary conditions due to insufficient shelter materials. UNRWA confirmed that winter aid in its warehouses in Egypt has not been allowed into Gaza, and the UN Secretary-General’s office warned that obstacles to humanitarian assistance persist.

The controversy began when blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence revealed that LuBian, a major Bitcoin mining pool controlling roughly 6% of global hashrate, had been hacked in December 2020. The attacker allegedly exploited weak private key generation on LuBian’s systems, draining over 90% of its Bitcoin holdings. For four years, the stolen funds remained untouched, fueling speculation that the perpetrator was a well-resourced actor. In 2024 the funds moved to a new wallet, and by 2025 the U.S. Department of Justice claimed to have seized the stash while indicting Chen Zhi, head of the Cambodian Prince Group, known for large-scale ‘pig-butchering’ scams involving trafficking and forced labor.

The network had purchased a Kyrgyzstani bank, Keremet, which helped transfer illicit funds to Promsvyazbank (PSB), a Russian state-owned bank linked to the military-industrial complex. The British National Crime Agency (NCA) described this operation as the connection of drug trafficking, organized crime, geopolitics, and Russian military finance. In a two-phase operation, authorities arrested 128 individuals and seized over 25 million pounds in cash and cryptocurrency. The NCA pointed to Russian-speaking networks Smart and TGR as central players in the laundering operation. Through these operations, money was converted into cryptocurrencies and sent globally, hiding its true origin.

The country's military-industrial complex relies on a Soviet-era industrial base, supplemented with modern machinery, including CNC tools imported from China and Europe. From early 2023 to mid-2024, Russia imported over 22,000 CNC machines and other components worth approximately $18 billion. Facilities like Uralvagonzavod, dating back to the 1930s, continue producing tanks, while newer plants such as Yelabuga, the world's largest drone factory, produce Iranian-designed drones at reduced unit costs. Russia's production of artillery shells has tripled, tank production has doubled, and approximately 4.5 million workers are employed in defense, nearly 20% of the manufacturing workforce.

On Monday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) announced it had canceled the release of the advance estimate for the third-quarter GDP of 2025. Originally scheduled for October 30, the report was delayed due to the government shutdown and has now been abandoned entirely. This follows the Labor Department's cancellation of the October jobs report and the Bureau of Labor Statistics scrapping its inflation report. The White House blamed these delays on the Democrats, accusing them of permanently damaging the federal statistical system. However, these cancellations coincide with growing concerns over the administration's economic policies, including mass deportation plans and tariffs, which some experts claim could reduce the GDP significantly.

This shift is mainly due to deforestation in the Congo rainforest, the second-largest in the world, which has been severely affected by logging and mining activities. From 2011 to 2017, African forests lost 106 million tonnes of biomass per year, contributing approximately 200 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. The Congo rainforest alone was responsible for a significant portion of this loss. These changes complicate global efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change. While satellite data has been used to measure this biomass loss, some experts caution that these measurements may not accurately capture the full extent of the impact, particularly when it comes to forests with different types of trees.

It traces a history where elite groups, such as slaveholders and industrialists, have consistently sought to undermine the government's ability to raise revenue. This has been done through manipulating tax systems, limiting tax enforcement, and employing strategies to weaken democratic governance. The piece connects historical moments, such as the influence of slaveowners in the formation of the U.S. Constitution and the subsequent attempts to limit the federal government's power to impose taxes, with contemporary policies under the Trump administration. The focus is on how a weakened tax system allows elites to retain disproportionate political and economic power.

The analysis, published by the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, documents 237 cyber incidents against Israel's space-related organizations, including the Israel Space Agency (ISA) and military contractors like Rafael. These cyberattacks, largely attributed to pro-Palestinian groups, intensified during the June conflict between Israel and Iran, peaking with 72 attacks in one month. The attacks were mainly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults, which flood websites with traffic, rendering them inoperable. Other attacks involved data breaches and leaks, some of which coincided with major military events in the conflict.

En el documento, el gobierno estadounidense acusa a Europa de 'subestimar su propio poder' frente a Rusia y señala problemas como las políticas migratorias, la censura a la libertad de expresión y la 'asfixia regulatoria' de la UE. Kallas, sin entrar en polémicas, reconoció que algunas de las críticas de Trump sobre la UE son ciertas, especialmente en cuanto a la necesidad de que Europa confíe más en su capacidad frente a desafíos globales. A pesar de estas discrepancias, Kallas subrayó que la relación transatlántica debe seguir siendo sólida y que la UE debe mantenerse unida.

Aunque la segunda etapa alcanzó la órbita con éxito, la primera etapa sufrió un fallo al intentar aterrizar, estrellándose contra la plataforma situada en el desierto de Gansú. Este lanzamiento es significativo porque el Zhuque 3 se une al creciente número de cohetes reutilizables en China, un sector cada vez más competitivo. A pesar del fallo en el aterrizaje, este avance muestra que LandSpace se adelanta a muchas iniciativas gubernamentales del país en cuanto a reutilización de etapas. Con una capacidad de carga de hasta 13,8 toneladas en órbita baja y el uso de metano y oxígeno líquidos como propelentes, el Zhuque 3 es una promesa para el futuro de los lanzamientos espaciales comerciales en China. La empresa ha tomado un enfoque similar al de SpaceX, buscando reducir los costos y mejorar la reutilización de sus cohete]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-lanzamiento-del-cohete-zhuque-3-alcanza-la-orbita-pero-falla-el-aterrizaje-de-la-primera-etapa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-lanzamiento-del-cohete-zhuque-3-alcanza-la-orbita-pero-falla-el-aterrizaje-de-la-primera-etapa</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 07:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las deficiencias del modelo público-privado en la sanidad madrileña: el caso del Hospital de Torrejón]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza el reciente escándalo del Hospital de Torrejón, gestionado por el Grupo Ribera, en el que salieron a la luz rechazos de pacientes para maximizar beneficios económicos. Este caso reabre el debate sobre la privatización de la gestión sanitaria en España, especialmente a través de los contratos de colaboración público-privada (CPP). El autor, Julio González García, explica que estos contratos, muy utilizados desde los años 2000, exigen una gran capacidad técnica de la Administración tanto para definir el proyecto como para supervisar su ejecución. El problema, según expone, es que el modelo tiende a priorizar la rentabilidad privada sobre la calidad asistencial. El texto recuerda que la Ley 15/1997, aprobada bajo el Gobierno de Aznar, permitió la gestión privada de servicios sanitarios públicos y que, desde entonces, se han repetido conflictos similares en otros hospitales como el de Alzira (Valencia).

A lo largo de su trabajo, Somoza explora los métodos de control, persecución y violencia que se ejercieron bajo el régimen de Francisco Franco, una etapa histórica marcada por la opresión política y social. El autor pone de manifiesto la necesidad de recordar y analizar los oscuros episodios del pasado para evitar que caigan en el olvido. En su análisis, la memoria histórica cobra una relevancia esencial, especialmente en un contexto en el que las voces que piden justicia para las víctimas del franquismo siguen luchando por el reconocimiento de su sufrimiento. La propuesta de Somoza invita a reflexionar sobre el impacto de la represión en la sociedad española y la importancia de no dejar que la historia sea distorsionada por el olvido.

El motivo es la publicación de anuncios que, según el sindicato, ofrecen infraviviendas que no cumplen con los requisitos legales de habitabilidad. UGT considera que ambas plataformas son responsables de permitir la aparición de estos anuncios, al obtener beneficios de ellos y al tener la capacidad técnica de moderar contenidos ilegales. 

Entre los ejemplos citados, figura un anuncio en Madrid de una vivienda de apenas 11 metros cuadrados en alquiler por 875 euros mensuales. El sindicato denuncia que muchos de estos anuncios ofrecen inmuebles sin cédula de habitabilidad y advierten incluso en el texto que la persona arrendataria no podrá empadronarse.

La compañía está quemando miles de millones de dólares y se enfrenta a pérdidas significativas, con una proyección de $140 mil millones entre 2024 y 2029. A pesar de la alta demanda de ChatGPT, la mayoría de los usuarios no están dispuestos a pagar por una suscripción, lo que está afectando los ingresos. Google ha logrado avances rápidos con su propia IA, Gemini, que ha superado en rendimiento a los modelos más poderosos de OpenAI.

Estas órdenes formaban parte de un plan de ahorro que buscaba mejorar la rentabilidad del hospital, pese a tratarse de una instalación pública gestionada de forma privada. Una de las pruebas más relevantes es un correo electrónico, cuya imagen figura en la noticia, donde un directivo recuerda que 'no se deben incluir pacientes no cápita en diálisis peritoneal'. Esta referencia a 'pacientes no cápita' alude a usuarios externos al área de cobertura, que se consideraban menos rentables para la concesionaria.

Estas movilizaciones, de menor escala que las de noviembre de 2023, fueron convocadas aprovechando un acto del Partido Popular contra el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. Revuelta, junto con Hazte Oír, llamó a manifestarse bajo el lema 'Todos a una contra la organización criminal', centrando su narrativa en la crítica al Ejecutivo socialista.

Pese a que Vox intentó distanciarse públicamente, los lazos entre ambos son evidentes. Figuras como Ignacio Garriga o Manuel Mariscal participaron en anteriores actos junto a la organización. Los analistas consideran que Revuelta actúa como una herramienta de movilización indirecta de Vox: canaliza la protesta callejera y le permite capitalizar el descontento juvenil sin asumir los posibles costes políticos o de imagen.

Este dispositivo, diseñado para lavadoras, logra eliminar más del 99 % de los microplásticos liberados con cada ciclo de lavado, un problema creciente que contamina ríos, suelos y alimentos. El sistema reproduce la estructura natural de las branquias de los peces: un embudo poroso que canaliza el flujo y evita atascos gracias a su autolimpieza. A diferencia de los filtros existentes, que suelen obstruirse o dejar pasar demasiadas partículas, este nuevo modelo mantiene una alta eficiencia con un mantenimiento mínimo. Además, su diseño permite fabricar el filtro con materiales comunes y ajustarlo fácilmente al espacio de los filtros internos ya presentes en muchas lavadoras modernas. El equipo colabora con el instituto Fraunhofer UMSICHT para llevar la tecnología al mercado y facilitar su integración]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-alemanes-crean-un-filtro-autolimpiante-que-reduce-casi-todo-el-microplastico-vertido-por-las-lavadoras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cientificos-alemanes-crean-un-filtro-autolimpiante-que-reduce-casi-todo-el-microplastico-vertido-por-las-lavadoras</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 00:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China anuncia ayuda humanitaria a Gaza y pide alto el fuego tras ataques israelíes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El gobierno chino ha anunciado que enviará 100 millones de dólares en ayuda humanitaria a Gaza, con el fin de aliviar la crisis y apoyar la reconstrucción de la región.

Las pérdidas acumuladas desde 2022 superan los 76 millones de euros, lo que obligó a sus accionistas, Primero Salud y Concessia, a conceder préstamos para mantener el hospital en funcionamiento. La compañía llegó a advertir que podría resolver el contrato de concesión firmado en 2009 si no se revisaban las condiciones. En julio de 2025, el Consejo de Gobierno aprobó un pago extraordinario de 32,78 millones tras esa presión.

El hallazgo se produjo en una fosa séptica de una vivienda en Sant Jaume dels Domenys, en el Baix Penedès, donde residía uno de los dos implicados en el crimen. Los detenidos son un hombre de 69 años y una mujer de 48, esta última expareja de la víctima.

Según las investigaciones de la Unitat Central de Persones Desaparegudes (UCPD) de los Mossos d’Esquadra, la víctima mantenía aún contacto con Sílvia, su ex, pese a que ella ya convivía con Josep, el otro arrestado.

El texto aborda los múltiples intentos frustrados de adaptar la novela 'Nothing Lasts Forever' de Roderick Thorp y las dificultades que tuvo el estudio para encontrar un actor protagonista. Tras el rechazo de grandes estrellas como Schwarzenegger, Stallone o Eastwood, el papel recayó en Bruce Willis, cuya elección fue inicialmente recibida con escepticismo por su asociación con la serie de comedia 'Luz de luna'. Sin embargo, la interpretación de Willis redefinió el concepto del héroe de acción al mostrar a un personaje más vulnerable, humano y alejado del arquetipo invencible. El artículo también menciona los problemas de producción y el caos industrial que caracterizaron el rodaje, aspectos que no impidieron que la película terminara siendo un fenómeno mundial.

Ambas peticiones fueron rechazadas por la presidencia de la UER, que solo permitió votar una modificación de las normas del festival. Esta decisión implicó de facto la aceptación de Israel en la competición.

Fue el primer hospital público gestionado por una empresa privada, algo posible gracias a las concesiones sanitarias aprobadas durante el mandato de José María Aznar. Aunque Alzira fue presentado como un ejemplo de eficiencia, acumuló enormes pérdidas que acabaron con un rescate público de más de 70 millones de euros.

En el caso de las redes móviles, se exige que al menos el 85% de la población mantenga cobertura durante esas cuatro horas de interrupción del suministro.

Para cumplir con el decreto, los operadores deberán equipar los emplazamientos con baterías o generadores, aunque la instalación resulta más compleja en zonas urbanas debido a limitaciones estructurales y permisos vecinales. Según el Ministerio de Transformación Digital, el 30% de los 10.400 emplazamientos necesarios ya dispone de sistemas de reserva energética, por lo que alrededor de 7.280 deberán reforzarse.

El buque, construido en Alemania en 1969 como parte de la serie ‘German Liberty’, había cambiado varias veces de nombre y propiedad antes de ser gestionado por una compañía panameña al servicio de una agencia de Hong Kong.

Quiles publicó un vídeo del control de pasaportes con un mensaje que ridiculizaba a Iglesias por su supuesta contradicción entre su ideología comunista y su estilo de vida. Iglesias replicó de forma mordaz, defendiendo su derecho a disfrutar de comodidades que él mismo puede pagar, y acusando a Quiles de actuar con hipocresía. El intercambio, que rápidamente se hizo viral, reabrió el debate sobre la coherencia entre la ideología y las acciones personales del exvicepresidente del Gobierno. Iglesias ha reiterado en varias ocasiones que no renuncia a su confort personal a pesar de su ideología política.

Este cambio afecta a más de 500.000 haitianos en los EE.UU., quienes se enfrentan a la posible deportación cuando expire el Estatus de Protección Temporal (TPS) en febrero de 2026. La periodista Felicia Persaud ha destacado que algunos votantes inmigrantes que ayudaron a Trump a llegar al poder ahora son quienes más sufrirán las consecuencias de sus políticas, especialmente aquellos haitianos, cubanos, venezolanos, somalíes y otros latinos que, a pesar de la retórica xenófoba, apoyaron su candidatura. Además, Trump ha ampliado las revisiones de Green Cards a ciudadanos de 19 países mayormente no blancos, lo que aumenta la tensión sobre cómo la administración trata a los inmigrantes de diversas razas.

Según el informe, la primera semana, del 8 al 14, estará marcada por la llegada de frentes atlánticos que afectarán principalmente a la mitad oeste de la Península, con lluvias moderadas a intensas en esas zonas. En cambio, el Cantábrico oriental, los Pirineos y Baleares apenas registrarán precipitaciones. Las temperaturas, aunque tenderán a bajar a partir del miércoles, seguirán siendo elevadas para la época, con máximas incluso por encima de los 22 o 24 °C en áreas costeras del Mediterráneo y valores suaves en el resto del país. Para la semana siguiente, del 15 al 21 de diciembre, la AEMET advierte de un aumento de la incertidumbre en el pronóstico, aunque el escenario más probable apunta a temperaturas superiores a las normales. Las lluvias podrían concentrarse en el noroeste peninsular, manteniéndose un tiempo más estable en el resto.

Se acusa además a la organización de prácticas peligrosas como la reutilización de material médico de un solo uso y de clasificar a los pacientes según la rentabilidad de sus enfermedades. Este comportamiento, calificado de mafioso por el autor, se enmarca en el modelo de 'colaboración público-privada' promovido por gobiernos autonómicos, que permitiría a empresas afines obtener beneficios a costa de la salud pública.

El Sindicato Socialista de Vivienda organizó una movilización para intentar frenar los desalojos, que comenzaron a primera hora del viernes con un importante despliegue de la Ertzaintza alrededor de las viviendas afectadas. Pese a la resistencia de decenas de personas solidarias, los tres desahucios se ejecutaron entre las 11:30 y las 15:00 horas. 

El conflicto se remonta a 2007, cuando una de las familias firmó una hipoteca bajo condiciones que, según denuncian, el banco modificó posteriormente sin aviso, aumentando la deuda de forma desproporcionada. Varias reclamaciones judiciales siguen activas, incluida una ante el Tribunal Supremo por cláusulas abusivas e IRPH.

Este precio desorbitado en EE. UU. responde a una estrategia de negocio que utiliza las lagunas regulatorias y las protecciones de patentes para maximizar las ganancias, mientras que los pacientes se ven obligados a pagar precios altísimos. En lugar de solicitar la aprobación para la venta libre en EE. UU., como se hizo en Europa, Bausch & Lomb optó por la vía de la prescripción médica, lo que permite establecer precios mucho más altos. Esto ha generado una gran disparidad de precios entre los dos continentes, alimentando la desconfianza en el sistema de salud estadounidense.

Takaichi, quien también ha defendido su determinación de ser una líder eficaz, ha expresado su desprecio por la conciliación laboral y personal, lo que ha generado críticas de organizaciones que representan a los afectados por el 'karoshi'. A pesar de sus declaraciones, la líder aclaró que no buscaba promover el trabajo excesivo.

Lo que empezó como una innovación para compensar la inferioridad numérica de Ucrania se ha convertido en una guerra industrializada en la que cada avance genera una contramedida inmediata. 

Rusia ha logrado una ventaja tangible gracias a su capacidad de producción y al apoyo tecnológico chino, que abastece sin límite su industria de fibra óptica.

Desde la Ley General de Sanidad de 1986, que introdujo los primeros mecanismos de colaboración público-privada, hasta las reformas recientes bajo el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, la sanidad pública española ha transitado de ser un servicio universal a un sistema parcialmente privatizado. Cada hito legislativo —como el Informe Abril de 1991, la Ley 15/1997 del gobierno de Aznar o la Ley 16/2003 impulsada por Zapatero— amplió las puertas a la gestión privada.

En compañías de más de 250 empleados, el “no uso” también ha aumentado, del 62,4 % en febrero al 68,6 % recientemente.

Fue detenido en Francia en mayo de 2019 tras 17 años de fuga, y España busca su extradición, aunque actualmente está pendiente de un juicio en Francia que se aplazó hasta abril de 2026 por motivos de salud. El juez Pedraz basa la orden en documentos intervenidos durante su detención que confirman, al menos de manera indiciaria, su liderazgo en la organización terrorista desde 2002. Ternera fue procesado por dirigir ETA y financiarla a través de las 'herriko tabernas', y además enfrenta causas relacionadas con atentados históricos, incluido el de Zaragoza en 1987, por el que la Fiscalía solicita más de 2.000 años de prisión. También se le investiga por el atentado en l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/santiago-pedraz-emite-orden-de-detencion-contra-josu-ternera-por-su-liderazgo-en-eta</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/santiago-pedraz-emite-orden-de-detencion-contra-josu-ternera-por-su-liderazgo-en-eta</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 12:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El primer tiro en la nuca no fue ETA, fueron los curas (N.

El sistema, inspirado en la ingeniería aeroespacial, optimiza el flujo del agua para evitar la separación del mismo y mantenerlo más tiempo adherido al casco, lo que reduce la turbulencia y el consumo de combustible. Estas modificaciones, que no exigen rediseñar los barcos, pueden aplicarse a flotas actuales de forma modular, convirtiéndose en una opción práctica y económica para mejorar la eficiencia energética sin sustituir los motores ni cambiar el combustible.

Bulleid, reconocido por sus diseños convencionales, decidió romper con la tradición al desarrollar la locomotora 'Leader', un modelo experimental que, pese a su apariencia moderna semejante a la de una diésel, funcionaba con vapor. Su diseño incluía dos cabinas de mando, motores con tres cilindros de vapor que movían cigüeñales y una transmisión por cadenas, algo inusual en locomotoras de la época. Sin embargo, el proyecto se vio frustrado por problemas prácticos: el fogonero trabajaba en condiciones extremas de calor, lo que provocó el rechazo sindical. Cuatro de las cinco máquinas construidas nunca se terminaron y todas acabaron desguazadas. Posteriormente, ya en Irlanda, Bulleid desarrolló la 'Turf Burner', una locomotora que empleaba turba como combustible]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-locomotoras-experimentales-de-oliver-bulleid-innovacion-frustrada-en-la-era-del-vapor</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-locomotoras-experimentales-de-oliver-bulleid-innovacion-frustrada-en-la-era-del-vapor</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 11:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE.UU. plantea suspender la vacunación universal al nacer frente a la hepatitis B]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un comité asesor de vacunas de los Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) de Estados Unidos votó el 5 de diciembre de 2025 a favor de retirar la recomendación universales de administrar la vacuna contra la Hepatitis B a todos los recién nacidos. Hasta ahora la pauta establecida desde 1991 preveía una dosis en las primeras 24 horas de vida, independientemente del estado serológico de la madre. Con el nuevo criterio, la vacuna al nacer se recomienda únicamente para bebés cuyas madres den positivo en la prueba del virus, o cuyo estado sea desconocido. Para los demás recién nacidos, se sugiere que los padres, junto con los profesionales sanitarios, decidan si vacunarlos y cuándo hacerlo; y que, en su caso, la primera dosis no se administre antes de los dos meses de edad.

El acuerdo tiene un valor de 195 millones de euros para dos años y cambia el sistema de pago de per cápita a uno basado en la actividad sanitaria realizada. Este modelo, aunque justificado por la Xunta como una medida de control presupuestario y mejora de eficiencia, genera preocupaciones sobre posibles incentivos a priorizar el volumen de procedimientos sobre la necesidad clínica. La polémica se intensifica debido a que el CEO de Ribera Salud, Pablo Gallart, había sido investigado en Madrid por ordenar rechazar pacientes y aumentar listas de espera para obtener beneficios económicos, lo que suscita dudas sobre el control efectivo de este tipo de contratos.

Según el autor, la falta de cobertura refleja la connivencia entre los grandes medios y el Estado británico, que clasifica a estos activistas como terroristas bajo la estricta Ley contra el Terrorismo. Los detenidos, que llevan encarcelados más de un año en prisión preventiva, protestan por su situación y por la decisión del gobierno de Keir Starmer de proscribir a su organización. La pieza critica también la hipocresía mediática en otros casos, como el de Julian Assange, que apenas recibió atención a pesar de las graves violaciones de derechos humanos que sufrió.

Salvini ha tratado de justificar el megaproyecto alegando su valor estratégico para la OTAN, pero expertos militares han señalado que el puente sería más un objetivo perfecto en caso de conflicto que un instrumento operativo útil, especialmente por su vulnerabilidad estructural.

El autor recuerda cómo Farage, entonces un adolescente de 17 años, le dirigió comentarios despectivos como 'ese es el camino de vuelta a África' y gestos de burla cada vez que lo encontraba en el patio del colegio. Bankole narra que aquellos comportamientos le marcaron profundamente, provocándole una sensación de miedo e inferioridad que no ha logrado olvidar con el paso de las décadas.

El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía informó que el detenido tenía una orden de alejamiento vigente respecto a la madre y al propio niño, decretada el pasado mes de octubre.

Estas grandes fortunas acumulan conjuntamente 213.000 millones de dólares, un aumento del 21,5% respecto a 2024. Destaca la figura de Amancio Ortega, fundador de Inditex, que concentra más de la mitad del total nacional con un patrimonio valorado en 124.000 millones. El crecimiento de estas fortunas, según UBS, se debe principalmente al buen desempeño empresarial y a la fuerte concentración de riqueza familiar. Además, el informe prevé que en los próximos quince años se traspasarán 162.000 millones de dólares en herencias, lo que plantea la necesidad de una gestión profesionalizada del relevo generacional. En el contexto global, el número de multimillonarios aumentó un 8,8%, hasta 2.919, sumando 386.500 millones de dólares más a la riqueza total.

La decisión se fundamenta en que el partido glorifica regímenes y figuras responsables de crímenes contra la humanidad, como el estalinismo, lo que contraviene los valores y tradiciones de la sociedad polaca y europea. La presidenta del Tribunal, Krystyna Pawłowicz, subrayó que no hay cabida legal para organizaciones que ensalcen criminales y regímenes responsables de millones de muertes, incluidos ciudadanos polacos. El intento de ilegalización del KPP se remonta a 2020, pero se había estancado por cuestiones procesales hasta que, en noviembre de 2025, el presidente de Polonia, Karol Nawrocki, presentó un nuevo requerimiento basado en la incompatibilidad del partido con la Constitución, que prohíbe ideologías totalitarias, incluyendo el comunismo.

Nacido en Canadá y nacionalizado estadounidense, Gehry dejó una profunda huella en la arquitectura contemporánea con su estilo innovador y su uso del titanio y las formas curvas e irregulares. Su obra más reconocida, el Museo Guggenheim de Bilbao, inaugurado en 1997, se convirtió en símbolo de la transformación urbana de la ciudad y en uno de los edificios más icónicos del siglo XX. Además del Guggenheim, Gehry diseñó obras emblemáticas como el Walt Disney Concert Hall en Los Ángeles (2003), el New World Center de Miami (2011) o la Fondation Louis Vuitton en París (2014). Su trabajo le valió numerosos galardones, entre ellos el Premio Pritzker de Arquitectura en 1989 y el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de las Artes en 2014.

El estudio muestra que el estado ha sufrido una pérdida continuada de empleos durante los primeros ocho meses de 2025, encadenando el primer retroceso laboral sostenido desde la pandemia de la Covid-19. La tasa de paro en agosto se situó en el 5,5 por ciento, más de un punto por encima de la media nacional, y se prevé que se mantenga en esa cifra hasta 2026, con una mejora moderada en 2027. El análisis identifica sectores especialmente afectados: construcción, comercio minorista, hostelería, fabricación y ocio.

Según el Gobierno, Red Eléctrica y expertos europeos, las empresas encargadas del control dinámico de la tensión —principalmente las centrales de gas y nucleares— no cumplieron con su función. Groizard ha señalado que el procedimiento de control vigente estaba diseñado para un modelo energético de hace veinte años y no se había adaptado al actual, donde las renovables tienen un papel más importante. Mientras tanto, en Portugal el mismo sistema funcionó correctamente gracias a la integración temprana de las energías renovables en estas tareas desde 2020.

En detalle, las consultas presentan una demora media de 32 días frente a los 60 de otros centros de nivel 2; las intervenciones quirúrgicas tienen una media de 48 días frente a los 42; y las pruebas diagnósticas se realizan en 3 días de media frente a los 57 de media general.

Discovery (WBD) para adquirir sus divisiones de cine, televisión y la plataforma de streaming HBO Max por un valor total de 83.000 millones de dólares, combinando efectivo y acciones. Esta operación no incluye el negocio televisivo de WBD, que mantiene canales como CNN, TNT y TBS. El pacto supone un cambio estructural en la industria audiovisual, pues Netflix pasa a controlar una gran parte del contenido cinematográfico clásico y moderno de Hollywood, desde Casablanca hasta franquicias como Harry Potter o El señor de los anillos. Según el contrato, los accionistas de Warner Bros recibirán 27,75 dólares por acción, con un valor empresarial final de 82.700 millones. Ted Sarandos, CEO de Netflix, afirmó que la unión de los catálogos permitirá “definir el próximo siglo de la narrativa”.

Según el informe de la consultora Challenger, Gray & Christmas, se trata de la sexta ocasión desde 1993 en la que el número de recortes laborales supera 1,1 millones antes de cerrar el año. Solo en noviembre de 2025 se registraron 71.321 despidos, un 24% más que los comunicados en noviembre de 2024, aunque un 53% menos que los de octubre.

Recordó el episodio de 2016 cuando diputados socialistas, como Margarita Robles, desobedecieron la orden del Comité Federal del PSOE para evitar unas terceras elecciones. Además, Aguirre abogó por un sistema más similar al del Reino Unido, donde los parlamentarios tienen mayor independencia a la hora de votar y rinden cuentas a sus electores.

El estudio analizó 104 investigaciones realizadas entre 2016 y 2024, con datos de participantes de todos los continentes. En 92 de estos trabajos se identificaron asociaciones claras entre una dieta rica en productos ultraprocesados y una mayor probabilidad de desarrollar o morir por patologías como cáncer, enfermedades cardiovasculares, respiratorias, renales, metabólicas y mentales.

Los alimentos ultraprocesados son productos industriales con alto contenido en azúcares, grasas y sal, además de aditivos como colorantes, saborizantes y edulcorantes artificiales.

Formó parte esencial de la historia de ABC, donde publicó 2.459 textos y mantuvo durante casi dos décadas la columna «Cosas que pasan».

Según su análisis, la sanidad privada, al funcionar con lógica de mercado, prioriza la rentabilidad por encima del bienestar social, lo que genera exclusión de las personas con menos recursos, reducción en la atención preventiva y mayor mortalidad evitable. Los seguros médicos, que se presentan como alternativa, se rigen por criterios de beneficio económico y tienden a excluir a quienes presentan mayor riesgo sanitario.

En Broadway, casi ninguna producción reciente ha recuperado su inversión, y los elevados costes de producción tras la pandemia, junto con la reducción del turismo y el menor gasto del público, han hecho que incluso obras con grandes nombres enfrenten enormes pérdidas. Mientras los musicales se hunden económicamente, las obras de teatro sin música prosperan gracias a presupuestos más modestos y al interés de actores de renombre en participar por prestigio. En paralelo, Hollywood registra su mayor crisis de empleo y producción en décadas: desde 2022, el número de trabajadores en la industria del cine en Los Ángeles ha caído un 30 %.

Corriàs, con cinco años de experiencia en este oficio, explica que puede llegar a cobrar hasta 5.000 euros por redactar libros completos para otros autores, especialmente cuando las obras están destinadas a ser publicadas y venderse. También trabaja en proyectos personales o familiares con presupuestos más modestos, alrededor de 2.500 euros, cuando no hay intención comercial. 

Durante la entrevista, Corriàs ha descrito el proceso creativo como un trabajo que va mucho más allá de escribir. Incluye fases de documentación, creación de personajes, descripciones y numerosas entrevistas con los clientes. Esta estructura le permite gestionar hasta siete proyectos simultáneamente, aunque solo suele centrarse en uno o dos en la fase de escritura pura.

Nacido en Japón y criado parcialmente en bases militares estadounidenses, Tagawa se trasladó a Los Ángeles, donde desarrolló su propio estilo de artes marciales, el Chu Shin. Fue descubierto por el director Bernardo Bertolucci y debutó en el cine internacional con 'El último emperador' en 1987, lo que le lanzó a la fama. A lo largo de su carrera, participó en más de 30 películas, destacando por interpretar villanos elegantes y carismáticos. Además de su carrera en cine y televisión, incluyendo la serie 'The Man in the High Castle', Tagawa fue un mentor cercano y generoso con jóvenes actores y artistas marciales. Su papel en 'Mortal Kombat' se convirtió en un clásico de culto, especialmente por la línea 'Tu alma es mía'.

Bastante fue contundente al afirmar que la institución eclesiástica ha actuado peor que otras en el tratamiento de las víctimas de abusos, denunciando una larga historia de protección a los agresores y falta de apoyo real a quienes sufrieron los delitos. Según el periodista, cuando se descubrieron casos de pederastia, la Iglesia española llegó incluso a trasladar sacerdotes a Latinoamérica para evitar investigaciones en España.

Bastante también abordó la conexión entre religión y poder, asegurando que la Conferencia Episcopal mantiene cada vez más afinidades con la extrema derecha y participa en una 'guerra cultural' que frena las reformas internas.

El aumento de la demanda procedente del sector de la IA ha provocado que los fabricantes de chips, como Samsung, SK Hynix y Micron, prioricen a los clientes corporativos dispuestos a pagar más, desplazando a los fabricantes de dispositivos de consumo.

En estos mensajes, Mazón respondió con un escueto ‘cojonudo’ a las alertas de Pradas sobre la situación en la Ribera Alta y otras zonas afectadas por la tormenta. La conversación también revela la negativa de Mazón y su equipo a implementar confinamientos o medidas drásticas, como el Es-Alert provincial, a pesar de los desbordamientos en varias comarcas. El jefe de gabinete de Mazón, José Manuel Cuenca, instó a Pradas a no confinar toda la provincia, sino a tomar medidas más localizadas, lo que generó controversia en torno a la falta de respuesta inmediata ante la gravedad de la crisis.

El fallo considera que el acuerdo constituía en realidad una subvención otorgada de manera directa, sin respetar los procedimientos de concurrencia pública exigidos por la ley. La denuncia fue presentada por la Agrupación de Profesionales Taurinos, que alegó que el convenio vulneraba los principios de igualdad al no permitir que otras entidades pudieran optar a la financiación. El tribunal concluye que la cuantía y estructura económica del acuerdo requerían una licitación abierta y que, por tanto, el procedimiento seguido fue irregular.

Ese proyecto, que más tarde sería conocido como JavaScript, se convirtió en la base sobre la que se construye la web interactiva actual. Originalmente, Netscape y Sun Microsystems anunciaron el lenguaje en diciembre de 1995 como una herramienta ligera para añadir interactividad a las páginas web, complementaria al lenguaje Java, más orientado a grandes aplicaciones empresariales. Pese a su desarrollo apresurado y algunas inconsistencias de diseño, JavaScript acabó imponiéndose como el lenguaje dominante en el desarrollo web, presente hoy en aproximadamente el 99 % de los sitios con código del lado del cliente. Durante sus primeros años, sufrió problemas de compatibilidad debido a la entrada de Microsoft con su versión JScript para Internet Explorer, lo que generó años de frustración para los desarrolladores.

Según explica, cerca del 44% de las instalaciones de autoconsumo están obligadas a operar sin verter a la red la energía sobrante, lo que reduce notablemente su rentabilidad y dificulta la expansión del sector, especialmente en entornos industriales donde la red suele tener capacidad suficiente para absorber excedentes. Gimeno considera que esta restricción es un freno evidente a la transición energética y sitúa a España por detrás de otros países europeos, donde la generación distribuida tiene mayor peso. Además, el directivo destaca la importancia creciente del almacenamiento energético.

Estos resultados se suman a los 720 cacharros retirados la semana anterior en la misma zona, lo que revela una actividad furtiva muy activa en el litoral del sur de Pontevedra.

Desde la tribuna, Bernal afirmó: “Me pone veros enfadados”, una expresión que generó un amplio rechazo tanto entre los presentes como en redes sociales. Según el artículo, el diputado acompañó sus palabras con una actitud chulesca, comparada con comportamientos típicos de ambientes de barra de bar, lo cual agravó la percepción de falta de respeto institucional.

Sin embargo, con el paso del tiempo se ha convertido en el único residente de esta pequeña localidad. La despoblación rural es un fenómeno creciente en España, afectando a miles de núcleos que pierden habitantes debido a la falta de servicios, oportunidades y al envejecimiento de la población. En Benamira, Fernando ha experimentado la soledad tras la muerte del anterior habitante, un anciano llamado Pedro, aunque asegura no sentir miedo sino tristeza por la pérdida de la vida comunitaria y patrimonial del pueblo. La ausencia de servicios básicos es un desafío diario: para ir a la tienda, la farmacia o el supermercado, Fernando debe desplazarse a localidades cercanas como Medinaceli, Almazán, Sigüenza o incluso Soria capital, a kilómetros de distancia. A pesar de las dificultades, Fernando disfruta de las ventajas de la vida rural]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fernando-unico-habitante-de-benamira-relata-su-vida-en-un-pueblo-despoblado-de-soria</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fernando-unico-habitante-de-benamira-relata-su-vida-en-un-pueblo-despoblado-de-soria</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 10:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meteorólogos enfrentan acoso y amenazas por informar sobre el cambio climático]]></title><description><![CDATA[La desinformación y las teorías conspirativas sobre el cambio climático están generando un ambiente hostil hacia los meteorólogos y comunicadores científicos. El caso del estadounidense Christopher Gloninger lo ilustra: tras años informando sobre los efectos del cambio climático en Iowa, recibió amenazas de muerte que terminaron forzando su renuncia. Estas agresiones nacen de la radicalización y del rechazo político hacia la ciencia climática, alimentado por campañas de desinformación y redes coordinadas que promueven mensajes de odio. Expertos señalan que la industria de los combustibles fósiles lleva décadas difundiendo falsedades para minimizar su responsabilidad en la crisis climática y retrasar la acción política. Hoy, la desinformación se amplifica mediante troles, bots y algoritmos que favorecen contenidos cargados de emoción, mientras algunos grupos políticos presentan las políticas climáticas como amenazas a la libertad individual o la soberanía nacional.

Según la encuesta, Aliança Catalana, liderada por Sílvia Orriols, se consolida como tercera fuerza política con aproximadamente 20 escaños proyectados, situándose junto a Junts per Catalunya y desplazando a esta formación como referente del espacio independentista conservador. Paralelamente, Vox logra superar al Partido Popular, convirtiéndose en la principal fuerza estatal de derechas en el Parlament. Sumando los apoyos de Aliança y Vox, la ultraderecha acumularía cerca de una cuarta parte de los escaños de la cámara catalana, lo que supone un avance considerable respecto a los resultados anteriores. Ambos partidos comparten posturas muy similares en materia de inmigración, con un discurso centrado en el rechazo a la población extranjera, especialmente la de origen africano y musulmán.

Según denuncias internas, directivos de la empresa habrían ordenado esterilizar los catéteres hasta un máximo de diez veces, algo que va en contra de las directrices europeas que exigen que este tipo de productos solo puedan ser reacondicionados por empresas especializadas. Esta práctica fue denunciada por varios empleados del hospital, quienes fueron posteriormente despedidos. El Ministerio de Sanidad ha iniciado una investigación para verificar la legalidad de las acciones del hospital, mientras que la empresa propietaria niega las acusaciones.

Aunque la intención parece noble, Vilches advierte de los peligros que supone para los derechos fundamentales, especialmente la privacidad y la confidencialidad del cifrado de extremo a extremo.

El autor recuerda que la Comisión Europea lleva años intentando implementar un sistema de vigilancia digital integral, y que este nuevo intento, aunque con lenguaje más amable y enfoque moralizante, mantiene la misma esencia intrusiva.

Según The Guardian, el secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth, ha sido acusado de haber emitido una orden verbal para eliminar a los supervivientes de un ataque a una embarcación supuestamente dedicada al narcotráfico cerca de Trinidad. Aunque tanto Hegseth como el almirante Frank Bradley lo niegan, las imágenes del segundo bombardeo, todavía no publicadas por el Pentágono, son objeto de controversia y podrían determinar si los tripulantes estaban indefensos o seguían combatiendo. Jim Himes, congresista demócrata, calificó el vídeo mostrado en sesión privada como una de las escenas más inquietantes de su carrera pública, mientras el senador republicano Tom Cotton defendió la legitimidad de la acción y negó que hubiera una orden de 'no dar cuartel'.

En un vídeo grabado por el periodista del Miami Herald David Goodhue, se escucha a la mujer gritar repetidamente que es ciudadana estadounidense y pedir ayuda mientras los agentes la sacan de su vehículo y le colocan las esposas.

Esta racha, iniciada tras la derrota ante Escocia en marzo de 2023, abarca la Nations League 2023, la Eurocopa 2024 y la clasificación al Mundial 2026. El empate 2-2 ante Turquía en Sevilla consolidó esta marca, demostrando que España resiste en escenarios adversos sin perder su esencia. Frente a un rival urgido por puntos, la Roja ajustó su juego con pragmatismo, dominando fases pero cediendo ante errores puntuales, lo que añade valor a la imbatibilidad. En contraste, la goleada 4-0 en Tiflis ante Georgia mostró su potencial ofensivo, con goles de Oyarzábal (de penalti), Zubimendi, Ferran Torres y otro de Oyarzábal, ejecutados con precisión y calma.

Esta obra propone un enfoque único de la nieve, explorando cincuenta palabras de distintos idiomas que capturan la esencia de este fenómeno natural. Desde el Ártico hasta Japón, pasando por Islandia, Campbell conecta la meteorología con la cultura y el lenguaje, mostrando cómo diferentes pueblos del mundo se relacionan con la nieve. La autora no solo presenta las palabras, sino que las coloca en su contexto cultural y climático, ofreciendo un viaje literario que va más allá del fenómeno meteorológico y abarca costumbres, leyendas y formas de vida. Además, el libro reflexiona sobre cómo el cambio climático podría afectar la utilización y la relevancia de estas palabras en el futuro, planteando preguntas sobre la desaparición de tradiciones y costumbres asociadas a la nieve.

Según la organización, los tomates se venden bajo la marca “Campos de Granada”, nombre de una empresa española que produce también en Marruecos. En los envases, el nombre de la marca aparece de forma destacada mientras que el origen real del producto —Marruecos— queda en un segundo plano, algo que podría confundir al consumidor y afectar a la venta de tomates nacionales. 

Miguel Monferrer, secretario provincial de COAG Granada, ha señalado que esta práctica constituye un ejemplo de deslocalización productiva y de competencia desleal hacia los agricultores locales. En plena temporada de tomate cherry en España, asegura que hay suficiente producción nacional en cantidad, calidad y precio, por lo que considera injustificable recurrir a importaciones de países terceros.

A través de un tono poético y reflexivo, el texto repasa la singularidad de su voz: baja, firme y profundamente humana. Labordeta no buscaba convencer, sino recordar, y su música —lejos del estruendo o la grandilocuencia— encarnaba una forma de resistencia serena y llena de dignidad. Canciones como “Somos”, “Aragón”, “Albada” o “Canto a la libertad” trascienden lo meramente musical para convertirse en actos de memoria colectiva, en homenajes a la tierra y sus gentes. El autor valora cómo su obra combinaba ternura y compromiso social, mostrando que la dignidad también se canta y que la esperanza se puede decir en voz baja. En la parte final, Moreno recuerda un viaje con su padre a los campos de Aragón, evocando tiempos de siegas duras y vidas humildes, y estableciendo un paralelismo entre esas generaciones de trabajadores y el propio Labordet]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jose-antonio-labordeta-la-voz-humilde-que-dio-sentido-a-una-tierra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jose-antonio-labordeta-la-voz-humilde-que-dio-sentido-a-una-tierra</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 06:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Enseñé a un pulpo a tocar el piano (me llevó 6 meses)]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo narra la historia de un YouTuber que dedica seis meses a enseñar a un pulpo llamado Taco a tocar el piano.

Según la transcripción de una teleconferencia mantenida el 1 de diciembre entre varios líderes europeos, Macron advirtió que existe la posibilidad de que Washington termine «traicionando» a Ucrania y a Europa en relación con las exigencias territoriales rusas, sin garantías claras de seguridad.

RTVE fue la primera en comunicar su salida, criticando que la UER se negara a una votación secreta sobre la presencia de Israel y denunciando presiones políticas dentro de la organización.

Estas subvenciones, que sumaron 1,8 millones de euros, estaban destinadas a financiar actividades extraescolares exclusivamente en colegios concertados, bajo el argumento de apoyar a familias con menos recursos. Sin embargo, la Sala de lo Contencioso Administrativo ha concluido que la medida generaba una doble discriminación: por un lado, frente a los alumnos de la escuela pública con más medios, y por otro, frente a los de la concertada con menos recursos. En su sentencia, el tribunal desmonta la justificación municipal de que los centros concertados soportan más gastos de mantenimiento, ya que las ayudas también podían cubrir actividades externas, sin relación con dichos costes.

El nombre hace referencia al artículo 47 de la Constitución, que garantiza el derecho a una vivienda digna. Según la ministra Isabel Rodríguez, Casa 47 permitirá consolidar el Estado del Bienestar y transformar la gestión pública del suelo y la vivienda. El nuevo ente gestionará todo el ciclo de construcción, desde la planificación hasta la entrega y administración de los inmuebles.

Los contratos de arrendamiento de las viviendas públicas que impulse esta entidad podrán alcanzar hasta 75 años de duración. Inicialmente se firmarán por 14 años, con renovaciones periódicas de 7 años —la última de 5—, supeditadas al cumplimiento de los requisitos económicos y patrimoniales establecidos.

Esta acción judicial, conocida como 'Ashby v. Schertz-Cibolo-Universal ISD', busca una medida cautelar general que afecte a los más de mil distritos escolares del estado, tras comprobarse que algunos de ellos han comenzado a exhibir los carteles pese a órdenes judiciales previas. El origen del conflicto está en la Ley SB 10, aprobada por el legislativo de Texas y defendida con fervor por el fiscal general Ken Paxton, que obliga a las escuelas a aceptar y mostrar copias de los Diez Mandamientos en versión de la Biblia del Rey Jacobo.

Aunque el informe confirma que se vulneraron los protocolos de manejo de información sensible, Hegseth posee autoridad para desclasificar datos de inteligencia, por lo que no se determinó si los procedimientos de desclasificación se aplicaron correctamente.

Oltra impulsó la desprivatización de varios hospitales en la Comunitat Valenciana, decisión que habría ocasionado pérdidas millonarias a Ribera Salud. Tras ello, el grupo habría contribuido a un proceso judicial sin pruebas sólidas, en connivencia con figuras de la extrema derecha como Cristina Seguí y dirigentes del Partido Popular valenciano, entre ellos Francisco Camps.

Este hallazgo se basa en la combinación de los datos de las dos últimas campañas del detector ATLAS del Gran Colisionador de Hadrones (LHC), mostrando una significancia de 3,4 desviaciones estándar por encima del fondo, lo que supera los 3,0 observados previamente por el detector CMS. Este resultado es crucial para entender el mecanismo de Higgs, que explica cómo las partículas adquieren masa mediante su interacción con el campo de Higgs. Hasta ahora, solo se habían observado interacciones firmes con fermiones de tercera generación, como quarks top y bottom o leptones tau. Detectar esta desintegración en muones permite confirmar que el mecanismo de Higgs también se aplica a partículas más ligeras de segunda generación.

La participación de enviados de Trump en las conversaciones refleja un intento estadounidense de delegar la contención de Rusia a Europa mientras reubica sus fuerzas hacia Asia, lo que genera tensiones internas en la administración norteamericana.

El presidente ruso destacó que, mientras Washington sigue comprando uranio a Rusia —clave para alimentar sus plantas nucleares—, presiona a India para que reduzca su importación de petróleo ruso. Según datos oficiales, Rusia suministra alrededor del 25% del uranio enriquecido que adquiere EE. UU., lo que supone ingresos de unos 1.200 millones de dólares en 2025. En cambio, desde el inicio de la guerra en Ucrania, las importaciones indianas de crudo ruso han pasado del 2% al 35% de su total, pese a las presiones y sanciones occidentales.

La investigación, que analizó 65 productos convencionales de 16 países, halló presencia de TFA en más del 80% de las muestras, especialmente en cereales de desayuno, panes integrales y refinados, pasta y bollería. Este compuesto se forma cuando pesticidas que contienen sustancias perfluoroalquiladas (Pfas) se descomponen en el suelo y son absorbidos por las plantas. Las concentraciones encontradas en los alimentos fueron, de media, cien veces superiores a las detectadas en el agua del grifo.

Los Pfas, utilizados desde los años cincuenta en la industria y en productos de consumo, se denominan 'químicos eternos' porque tardan siglos en degradarse y pueden permanecer en suelos y aguas durante generaciones.

Este anuncio se produce tras la asamblea general de la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER), donde se debatió la continuidad de Israel en el certamen debido a la creciente controversia política internacional. Con esta decisión, Irlanda se une a España y los Países Bajos, que también han anunciado su retirada del concurso como muestra de rechazo a la presencia israelí. 

Irlanda es uno de los países más emblemáticos en la historia del festival, con un récord de siete victorias desde su debut en 1966, incluyendo tres triunfos consecutivos en 1992, 1993 y 1994. También es conocida por haber lanzado a figuras como Johnny Logan, único artista que ha ganado Eurovisión en dos ocasiones. 

La retirada se interpreta como un gesto político y ético, que busca presionar a la organización del festival para revisar la participación de países implicados en conflictos internacionales. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/irlanda-anuncia-su-retirada-de-eurovision-2026-en-protesta-por-la-participacion-de-israel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/irlanda-anuncia-su-retirada-de-eurovision-2026-en-protesta-por-la-participacion-de-israel</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 21:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Protestas masivas en Gießen frenan el acto juvenil de la ultraderecha alemana]]></title><description><![CDATA[El pasado fin de semana, unas 50.000 personas se manifestaron en la ciudad alemana de Gießen para impedir la celebración de una conferencia juvenil del partido de extrema derecha Alternativa para Alemania (AfD). Los manifestantes, organizados en bloqueos masivos desde primera hora del día, lograron retrasar la apertura del evento, que pretendía lanzar una nueva organización llamada 'Generación Alemania'. Dicha agrupación sustituye a la anterior 'Alternativa Juvenil', disuelta tras ser clasificada como 'extremista' por los servicios de inteligencia alemanes. La intervención policial fue intensa, con el uso de gas pimienta, cañones de agua y cargas contra los manifestantes, lo que generó numerosas denuncias de violencia desproporcionada. A pesar de la represión, solo una fracción de los delegados de la AfD logró acceder a la conferencia. El nuevo grupo juvenil busca presentarse de forma más profesional, aunque mantiene los mensajes racistas y autoritarios característicos del partido.

RTVE considera que estas medidas son insuficientes y ha cumplido su promesa de abandonar el certamen si Israel era admitido, en el contexto del genocidio en Gaza y de las críticas internacionales hacia el Gobierno de Benjamin Netanyahu.

España pone fin así a casi 65 años de participación continua en Eurovisión, siendo uno de los miembros fundadores del llamado 'Big Five'.

País Vasco encabezará la lista con la menor tasa de desempleo del país (6,4%), seguido por Cantabria, Aragón, Navarra, La Rioja y Galicia, todas por debajo del 7,5%. En conjunto, estas cifras acercan por primera vez en casi dos décadas a buena parte de España a una situación similar al pleno empleo, entendida como aquella en la que prácticamente todas las personas que quieren trabajar pueden hacerlo. 

En contraste, la mitad sur del país sigue mostrando mayores dificultades.

Esta proliferación, impulsada por la reducción de costes de lanzamiento y la falta de regulación internacional, amenaza tanto la astronomía terrestre como la espacial.

El equipo de Alejandro Borlaff, investigador de la NASA, ha simulado los efectos de la luz reflejada en telescopios como el Hubble, SPHEREx, el futuro ARRAKIHS de la ESA y el planificado Xuntian chino.

El tribunal considera que no existen indicios mínimos que justifiquen su imputación por un presunto delito de malversación relacionado con la contratación de Cristina Álvarez, asesora de Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente del Gobierno. Con esta decisión, la Audiencia corrige al juez Juan Carlos Peinado, que mantenía abierta la investigación dentro del llamado 'caso Begoña Gómez'.

Este mecanismo permite transmitir alertas e incidencias de tráfico directamente a los navegadores y sistemas multimedia de los vehículos mediante ondas de radio FM y sin coste adicional. A diferencia de las balizas conectadas, que cuestan entre 40 y 50 euros y necesitan conexión a internet, el TMC utiliza el canal de datos del sistema RDS, enviando mensajes codificados de 104 bits cada cinco minutos. Su diseño garantiza fiabilidad mediante duplicación de mensajes y permite a los coches mostrar avisos visuales y sonoros, además de recalcular rutas en tiempo real para evitar atascos o accidentes. En países como Alemania, Francia, o Reino Unido, este sistema es de uso generalizado y gratuito, mientras que en España solo RNE3 emite datos TMC, con una cobertura limi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-sistema-aleman-tmc-una-opcion-gratuita-y-eficaz-frente-a-las-balizas-v16</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-sistema-aleman-tmc-una-opcion-gratuita-y-eficaz-frente-a-las-balizas-v16</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 18:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallece Steve Cropper, figura clave del soul y guitarrista de Stax Records]]></title><description><![CDATA[Steve Cropper, uno de los guitarristas y compositores más influyentes del soul, falleció a los 84 años, según confirmó su hijo Cameron. Nacido en 1941 en Dora (Misuri), Cropper se trasladó a Memphis durante su infancia, donde su talento floreció como parte fundamental del sello Stax Records. Miembro de Booker T. & the MG’s, fue coautor de clásicos como 'Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay' junto a Otis Redding o 'In the Midnight Hour' con Wilson Pickett. Su estilo elegante y sobrio, caracterizado por un dominio natural del ritmo y una afinada sensibilidad melódica, marcó el sonido del soul de los años sesenta. Además de ser pieza central de Stax, Cropper trabajó con artistas como Sam & Dave, Rufus y Carla Thomas o Eddie Floyd, con quien coescribió 'Knock on Wood'. Su reconocimiento se amplió cuando integró la banda de los Blues Brothers, tanto en 'Saturday Night Live' como en la película 'Granujas a todo ritmo'.

La intervención artística, ideada por el reverendo Stephen Josoma, busca denunciar las políticas migratorias del gobierno de Donald Trump, quien ha prometido intensificar las deportaciones en todo el país. Bajo el cartel principal se añadió otro mensaje en el que se afirma que 'la Sagrada Familia está a salvo en el santuario de la iglesia' y se invita a contactar con la Red de Justicia de Inmigración de Massachusetts (LUCE) si se avista a agentes migratorios. La protesta ha dividido a la comunidad católica local: mientras algunos feligreses han expresado su orgullo por la iniciativa, otros la consideran una falta de respeto hacia el sentido espiritual de la Navidad.

En su charla con David Broncano, el músico reflexionó sobre su éxito reciente con 'Mitoaroa', un espectáculo de mitología vasco-navarra que ha llenado recintos como el Navarra Arena y que próximamente llegará a San Mamés. Reparaz destacó que su trayectoria está profundamente vinculada a la defensa del euskera, elemento que considera el verdadero motor de su carrera. 

La actuación de Zetak, centrada en la canción 'Aralarko Dama', inspirada en figuras mitológicas como Mari o el zezengorri, generó una oleada de comentarios positivos en las redes.

La periodista sostiene que RTVE incurrió en un fraude laboral al obligarla a crear una sociedad, Sukun Comunicación, con la que fue contratada. La Inspección de Trabajo confirmó esta irregularidad, dando de alta de oficio a Intxaurrondo en la Seguridad Social. En su demanda, la periodista acusa a RTVE de vulnerar sus derechos fundamentales y solicita una indemnización por daños económicos y sufrimiento psíquico o espiritual, en base a una sentencia del Tribunal Supremo de 2013. RTVE, tras la inspección, le ofreció un contrato como trabajadora en régimen de artistas, con menor retribución —unos 140.814 euros anuales—, que ella rechazó al considerar que no reconocía la naturaleza ordinaria de su relación laboral.

Esta decisión fue aprobada por el Consejo de Administración de RTVE y supone un hecho sin precedentes para un país del Big Five, cuyos miembros tradicionalmente garantizan la emisión de las semifinales y la final debido a su elevado número de espectadores. El presidente de RTVE, José Pablo López, ha denunciado el descontrol y la politización del festival, afirmando que presiones externas han comprometido la integridad del concurso. La retirada del canal público afectaría tanto a la audiencia como a la economía del evento, considerando que España aportó 331.721 euros en derechos de emisión en 2025 y que los datos de audiencia registraron un récord con casi 5,9 millones de espectadores y un 50,1% de share.

La gravedad de los hechos ha llevado a que 43 mujeres presentaran denuncias formales ante medios y tribunales vaticanos, señalando a autoridades de la organización en Argentina y otros países de América Latina y Europa.

Esta situación no solo limita su libertad y bienestar, sino que también erosiona los principios democráticos al favorecer a los grandes empresarios y oligopolios que traducen su poder económico en influencia política.

Ricart ideó, en 1819, un método propio basado en planchas de latón con caracteres perceptibles al tacto, anticipando así los sistemas que más tarde darían lugar al Braille. Su iniciativa, presentada al Ayuntamiento de Barcelona en 1820, proponía crear una escuela gratuita y universal para invidentes. Sin embargo, su proyecto fue desatendido por las autoridades, aunque recibió apoyo moral y la valoración positiva de una comisión municipal. Paralelamente, el sacerdote Manuel Catalá fundó la llamada Academia Cívica y Gratuita, adoptando y modificando parcialmente el método de Ricart, lo que originó un conflicto entre ambos por la autoría y reconocimiento del sistema de enseñanza.

Sin embargo, el Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica confía en que la mayor generación renovable y el incremento de la demanda eléctrica compensen ese aumento, reduciendo el coste final para los consumidores. Según las estimaciones oficiales, el descenso de la factura podría oscilar entre un 4% y un 10%, dependiendo del tipo de cliente: una reducción del 4,66% para los hogares acogidos a la tarifa regulada (PVPC), del 4,95% para las pymes, del 8,55% para la industria y del 9,91% para los consumidores electrointensivos. Estas previsiones se basan en un precio futuro del MWh de 56,7 euros, inferior al promedio de 2025, que fue de 64,96 euros.

Según Garzón, tres magistrados del Supremo impartieron cursos remunerados para el Ilustre Colegio de Abogados de Madrid (ICAM), parte querellante en el caso, mientras deliberaban sobre el fallo, lo que vulneraría las normas de incompatibilidad judicial. Esta situación se considera un ataque directo a la apariencia de imparcialidad del tribunal. La sentencia original condenaba a García Ortiz por revelación de secretos en el caso del empresario Alberto González Amador, vinculado a Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Según el informe al que tuvo acceso El Plural, la Consejería de Sanidad firmó más de 408.000 contratos menores por un importe superior a los 900 millones de euros, lo que representó el 99,5% del total. Este tipo de contrataciones, aunque legales, deberían usarse solo de forma excepcional, ya que evitan los procesos competitivos de licitación pública y pueden generar sobrecostes significativos. Audita Sanidad estima que, con una gestión adecuada, esos recursos podrían haber servido para construir 82 centros de salud adicionales o contratar a unos 14.000 profesionales sanitarios.

Con ingredientes sencillos como patatas, pimientos, cebolla y ajo, este plato es una opción perfecta tanto como plato principal o guarnición. Su origen se encuentra en el sureste de España, donde pastores y campesinos solían prepararlo con lo que tenían a mano. La receta destaca por su versatilidad y su capacidad para adaptarse a diferentes acompañamientos, como carne o huevos fritos. Para prepararlas, basta con freír las patatas junto a las verduras en aceite de oliva, lo que les aporta un sabor único. El truco de añadir un toque de vinagre a los ajos machacados le da un sabor extra que hace que el plato sea aún más sabroso. Las patatas deben ser de buena calidad para soportar bien la fritura y es recomendable no usar patatas congeladas. El resultado es un plato sencillo, nutritivo y lleno de sabor que puede salvar cualquier comida.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/patatas-a-lo-pobre-una-receta-sencilla-y-deliciosa-para-disfrutar-en-cualquier-momento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/patatas-a-lo-pobre-una-receta-sencilla-y-deliciosa-para-disfrutar-en-cualquier-momento</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La UER decide el futuro de Israel en Eurovisión mientras España sopesa retirarse del festival]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER) celebra los días 4 y 5 de diciembre una asamblea clave para el futuro de Eurovisión.

Los datos proceden de las liquidaciones oficiales del Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS). Los centros afectados son la Fundación Jiménez Díaz, el Hospital Rey Juan Carlos de Móstoles, el Infanta Elena de Valdemoro y el General de Collado Villalba. El aumento de pagos coincidió con un incremento de pacientes derivados a estos hospitales privados, fenómeno que el Ejecutivo regional atribuye a la 'libre elección' de centro sanitario por parte de los ciudadanos.

Hernández había sido declarado culpable en 2024 por liderar lo que los fiscales describieron como un 'narcoestado', facilitando el tráfico de más de 400 toneladas de cocaína hacia Estados Unidos, con ayuda de funcionarios hondureños y organizaciones criminales como el cartel de Sinaloa. El indulto fue percibido como una contradicción con la actual campaña militar de Trump contra presuntos narcotraficantes en América Latina, que ya ha causado más de 80 muertes en ataques marítimos.

Diversos analistas y políticos, incluso del Partido Republicano, denunciaron la incoherencia de liberar a un exmandatario condenado por narcotráfico mientras se amenaza con invadir Venezuela bajo la acusación de que Nicolás Maduro dirige un cartel.

Según la documentación oficial obtenida por El País, la concesionaria había solicitado una compensación inicial de más de 53 millones por los costes añadidos derivados de nuevas tecnologías, fármacos de alto impacto y servicios no contemplados en el contrato original. El ejecutivo autonómico justificó el pago alegando que el hospital se encontraba en una 'situación de práctica insolvencia', con patrimonio negativo y pérdidas acumuladas, lo que hacía inviable su funcionamiento sin apoyo público.

Este caso se enmarca en el modelo de gestión mixta impulsado durante la etapa de Esperanza Aguirre, que permitía a empresas privadas construir y explotar hospitales públicos a cambio de una retribución anual del Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS).

Los agentes le acusaron de desobediencia y lesiones, y el atestado reflejaba que el joven había agredido a uno de ellos durante la detención. Sin embargo, las grabaciones de las cámaras de seguridad de una farmacia desmintieron por completo esta versión: en ningún momento el joven lanzó patadas ni opuso resistencia.

Según su denuncia, que ha sido presentada ante la Fiscalía, la mujer recibió numerosos mensajes de tono sexual de parte de Navarro. En los mensajes, que se remontan a 2021, el político socialista hacía comentarios sobre su apariencia física y realizaba insinuaciones que ella no había solicitado. La situación empeoró cuando, según la denunciante, Navarro la tocó sin su consentimiento en septiembre de ese año. A pesar de las advertencias de la mujer de que lo denunciaría, él continuó insistiendo con disculpas y más mensajes durante varias horas. El caso ha sido trasladado a la Fiscalía Provincial de Málaga, y aunque el PSOE ha confirmado que solicitaría una suspensión cautelar de su militancia si la denuncia avanzaba, Navarro niega las acusaciones y las califica como parte de una venganza política.

La licencia fue concedida bajo la condición de que Feijóo fuera el propietario del inmueble, pero tras la venta de la vivienda en 2021, el Concello de Moaña ordenó la demolición al considerar que el muro excedía la altura permitida y ocupaba espacio municipal. El actual dueño de la propiedad ha perdido el recurso de apelación ante el TSXG y ahora enfrenta la obligación de destruir la estructura.

Ante esta grave situación, el personal sanitario notificó en el juzgado de guardia el colapso, buscando protegerse en caso de que ocurra algún incidente grave. Los sanitarios alertan que, aunque el colapso se produce cada año con la gripe, este ha llegado mucho antes y con una magnitud mayor. Además, la falta de recursos en otros hospitales y el incremento de las listas de espera en la sanidad madrileña agravan el problema.

Aunque esta mutación es poco frecuente, ha sido documentada en otras ocasiones en anfibios. Las causas de estas mutaciones aún no están claras, pero algunos científicos sugieren que podrían ser provocadas por infecciones parasitarias.

Sin embargo, una iniciativa propuesta buscaba cambiar esta normativa, sugiriendo que todas las personas, independientemente de su género, deberían cumplir con un servicio nacional, ya sea militar o en tareas de protección civil, medioambientales o sociales. La propuesta fue rechazada rotundamente en un referéndum celebrado el 30 de noviembre de 2025, con más del 84 % de los votantes en contra. Muchos argumentaron que el ejército y los servicios de protección civil ya cuentan con suficientes efectivos, y que imponer nuevas obligaciones sería costoso para el Estado.

Aunque la medida parecía efectiva al principio, pronto se demostró que su diseño era un desastre. Los cazadores, en lugar de matar a las ratas, simplemente les cortaban las colas y las liberaban, lo que llevó a un aumento en la población de roedores. Esta práctica fomentó la cría y el tráfico de ratas y colas, exacerbando el problema de salud en lugar de solucionarlo. La caza de ratas se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo las políticas mal diseñadas pueden tener consecuencias imprevistas, al no comprender la complejidad de los comportamientos humanos y los ecosistemas urbanos.

El centrocampista croata destacó el nivel de exigencia del Madrid, donde ‘no se tolera la mediocridad’, y habló sobre el amor y el respeto que siempre sintió por parte de los aficionados del club. A pesar de los rumores sobre su salida, Modrić confesó que su deseo siempre fue retirarse allí. Además, recordó su difícil infancia durante la guerra en los Balcanes, la evolución de su carrera, sus inicios en el fútbol y cómo se enfrentó a las dificultades físicas que ponían en duda su éxito en el fútbol profesional. A pesar de los obstáculos, siempre confió en sus habilidades, y hoy, con una carrera llena de éxitos, recuerda con cariño los momentos difíciles que le ayudaron a forjar su carácter y su éxito a nivel mundial.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/luka-modric-habla-sobre-su-salida-del-real-madrid-y-su-legado-en-el-club</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/luka-modric-habla-sobre-su-salida-del-real-madrid-y-su-legado-en-el-club</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 23:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Menores graban un vídeo mientras agreden a un indigente en Benacazón]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dos menores de edad están siendo investigados por la Guardia Civil tras grabarse en un vídeo donde se les ve quemando el pelo a un indigente en un parque de Benacazón. Según las imágenes, uno de los menores imita a un policía dando órdenes al otro para que agreda al hombre, burlándose de su peinado. Durante varios minutos, uno de los chicos quema diferentes partes del pelo del indigente, quien en un momento pide que paren. El incidente fue denunciado ante las autoridades tras la difusión del vídeo en redes sociales. La investigación podría derivar en un delito de odio, ya que la agresión incluye un componente de humillación y discriminación. Los agentes del puesto de Sanlúcar la Mayor están a cargo de la investigación, aunque el caso podría ser trasladado a otra unidad con más competencias.

Los hechos ocurrieron en 2017 y afectaron a más de 20 hectáreas de terrenos, valoradas entre 360.000 y 540.000 euros, permitiendo a dos agricultores obtener autorizaciones de viñedo de forma irregular en perjuicio de otros solicitantes con mejor derecho. La exalcaldesa emitió un informe oficial que simulaba la existencia de arrendamientos a una mercantil, pese a saber que eran falsos, y firmó un contrato ficticio de 2015 que se presentó en un procedimiento de revisión de oficio. El juicio se resolvió mediante conformidad, aplicando la atenuante de dilaciones indebidas.

El primero, en la final del Mundial de Qatar 2022, donde Lionel Messi ejecutó un penalti que parecía implicar un doble toque. La tecnología no intervino y Argentina ganó el título sin revisar a fondo la jugada. El segundo, en un partido entre Atlético de Madrid y Real Madrid, también en una tanda de penaltis, vio cómo se anulaba un penalti de Julian Álvarez por sospecha de un doble toque, pero sin pruebas claras. La disparidad en el tratamiento de ambas situaciones alimentó las críticas al VAR, ya que mientras en la final del Mundial no se revisó a fondo, en Madrid se anuló una acción sin evidencias concluyentes. Este tipo de decisiones han abierto un debate sobre la fiabilidad del VAR, la consistencia de sus criterios y cómo afecta a la percepción de justicia en el fútbol, especialmente en un contexto donde las apuestas deportivas también tienen gran influencia.

Aunque existen principios comunes, como la exigencia de licencias para operadores y medidas de protección del consumidor, la aplicación concreta varía notablemente entre estados. Algunos países, como Finlandia, han mantenido monopolios estatales para proteger a los jugadores y garantizar que el beneficio económico no prevalezca sobre la seguridad del consumidor. En contraste, Malta ha adoptado un marco más flexible y competitivo, atrayendo a operadores internacionales por la claridad y adaptabilidad de sus normas. España aplica un sistema de licencias competitivas con fuerte supervisión, especialmente en publicidad y control de menores y colectivos vulnerables.

Este enorme dirigible de helio, diseñado para transportar aviones ligeros de reconocimiento llamados Sparrowhawk, representaba un innovador intento de ampliar la capacidad militar desde el aire. A pesar de su compleja estructura de duraluminio, motores internos y sistemas de seguridad, el Akron sufrió varios incidentes menores durante su servicio, que culminaron con su caída en una tormenta frente a la costa de Nueva Jersey, provocando la muerte de 73 personas. Además, un dirigible de rescate enviado también se estrelló, sumando dos víctimas más. El proyecto de portaaviones aéreos se abandonó posteriormente debido a la vulnerabilidad de estas aeronaves y al incendio del Hindenburg, que minó la confianza en los dirigibles.

Para Kittel, la revelación del dopaje sistemático, aunque dolorosa, fue necesaria para mejorar el futuro del deporte.

Testimonios de familiares, conductores de camiones de ayuda y exmilitares israelíes describen que cadáveres fueron enterrados en fosas poco profundas sin marcar, dejados a descomponerse o cubiertos con tierra por bulldozers del ejército israelí. Esto incluye incidentes registrados en junio y septiembre, corroborados mediante vídeos, fotografías y análisis de imágenes satelitales. Expertos legales indican que estas prácticas podrían violar el derecho internacional, constituyendo crímenes de guerra al faltar al respeto a la dignidad de los fallecidos y al impedir su identificación por las familias.

Este impuesto, uno de los más regresivos del mundo, afecta por igual a todos los consumidores en productos básicos, lo que podría reducir el consumo y agravar la desigualdad. Aunque se presenta como una medida para reemplazar otros impuestos y mejorar la eficiencia económica, en la práctica los empresarios no suelen trasladar las reducciones fiscales a precios más bajos, mientras que los incrementos se aplican de inmediato al consumidor. El trasfondo de esta política refleja un modelo libertario donde la supuesta “libertad” se traduce en capacidad de pago, y los servicios públicos esenciales como salud, educación y alimentación quedan cada vez más sujetos a la lógica del mercado.

La protesta, debidamente comunicada, fue bloqueada por la policía, que retuvo a los manifestantes durante más de tres horas en un parking de la facultad de Derecho. Los colectivos denuncian que la actuación policial fue violenta, con cargas que causaron heridas a 12 personas, una de ellas trasladada al hospital, y múltiples identificaciones y retenciones arbitrarias. En contraste, se permitió la libre circulación de Vito Quiles y sus seguidores, llegando incluso a saltarse un cordón policial. Los activistas critican también la cobertura mediática de los hechos, que consideran sesgada o directamente tergiversada, así como la pasividad del rectorado de la ULL, encabezado por Francisco Javier García Rodríguez, que no tomó medidas para evitar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/denuncian-agresion-policial-contra-manifestantes-antifascistas-en-la-universidad-de-la-laguna</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/denuncian-agresion-policial-contra-manifestantes-antifascistas-en-la-universidad-de-la-laguna</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 18:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ciudadano logra ser atendido tras atrincherarse en la oficina del SEPE por errores en su inscripción]]></title><description><![CDATA[Manuel Medina, residente en Gran Canaria, se vio obligado a atrincherarse en la oficina del Servicio Público de Empleo (SEPE) en la calle República Dominicana después de que sus intentos previos para corregir errores en su inscripción y recibir su prestación por desempleo no tuvieran éxito.

Tras el ataque, buscó ayuda en la propia universidad y en diversas instituciones, pero no recibió ninguna respuesta efectiva. A través de una trabajadora social del centro especializado Cimascan, Sabina intentó durante años que la universidad adoptara medidas o investigara los hechos, pero la respuesta fue siempre negativa. La institución alegó que los casos de agresión sexual no podían tramitarse administrativamente, solo los de acoso, y que no existía una queja formal que activara su protocolo interno. En 2024, la víctima consiguió presentar una denuncia judicial tanto contra su agresor como contra la universidad, a la que acusa de inacción y de responsabilidad civil por los daños psicológicos sufridos posteriormente.

Sin embargo, en 2020 esa cifra se redujo al 4,3% a nivel mundial y apenas al 0,3% en países como Japón y Noruega. Esta notable disminución se debe a múltiples factores: mejoras en la nutrición, acceso a agua limpia, saneamiento, cuidados neonatales, vacunas, medicinas y reducción de la pobreza, conflictos y hambrunas. Antes de 1800, casi todos los padres perdían al menos un hijo; hoy en día, perder un hijo es una experiencia poco común. Los comentarios de los lectores resaltan ejemplos históricos y familiares que muestran cómo la mortalidad infantil afectaba generaciones pasadas, con niños falleciendo en la infancia o por enfermedades como la polio. Los testimonios también subrayan que gran parte del aumento de la esperanza de vida en el último siglo se debe a la reducción de muertes tempranas, más que a avances en la medicina para personas mayores.

Comienza explicando el origen del nombre 'manzana', derivado del latín *malum*, que significaba tanto 'manzana' como 'malo', y cómo la variedad cultivada por el botánico romano Gayo Macio, llamada *malum matianum*, dio lugar al término actual en castellano. A partir de ahí, el autor recorre tres episodios emblemáticos donde la manzana ha tenido un protagonismo trágico o simbólicamente poderoso: el mito del Jardín del Edén, la Guerra de Troya y el cuento de Blancanieves. En el primer caso, recuerda que la Biblia nunca menciona que el fruto prohibido fuera una manzana, sino que esa asociación surgió por una confusión lingüística en la traducción de San Jerónimo al latín. En el mito griego, la 'manzana de la discordia' lanzada por la diosa Eris desencadena la guerra de Troya tras el juicio de Paris en favor de Afrodita.

Este huevo, uno de los 50 huevos imperiales Fabergé creados para las últimas dos emperatrices rusas, fue diseñado por Alma Pihl y se distingue por su cubierta de cuarzo con incrustaciones de platino y más de 1.500 diamantes en corte rosa que simulan copos de nieve. El interior del huevo revela una cesta de platino y diamantes con flores de cuarzo talladas, cuyas hojas están esculpidas en nefrita y decoradas con granates demantoides. La tradición de los huevos imperiales comenzó con el zar Alejandro III en 1885 y continuó con su hijo, Nicolás II, hasta 1916, con diseños cada vez más elaborados y la exigencia de que cada huevo contuviera una sorpresa.

Según el plan nacional, la presencia de restos de comida procedentes del exterior dejados en áreas de descanso podría haber sido el foco de contagio inicial.

La propuesta, respaldada por los grupos Adelante Andalucía y Por Andalucía, planteaba una serie de medidas como la contratación de 13.000 nuevos docentes para el curso 2029-2030 y la mejora de la atención a estudiantes con necesidades educativas especiales. La iniciativa también defendía la creación de 'ratios máximas' de 18 alumnos en Infantil y Primaria, 23 en Secundaria y 27 en Bachillerato. El PSOE-A ha criticado que el Gobierno de Moreno Bonilla y su partido continúen con una política de recortes en la educación pública y favorezcan la educación privada. Por su parte, el PP ha argumentado que ya se han firmado acuerdos con los sindicatos que abordan estas mismas demandas.

Durante su estancia, presenció a diario escenas de extrema violencia, con numerosos niños, mujeres y adultos mutilados por bombardeos y enfrentamientos armados. Los recursos hospitalarios eran extremadamente limitados, con escasez de anestésicos, gasas, compresas, antibióticos y, sobre todo, personal médico para atender a oleadas masivas de heridos, que a veces llegaban a cientos en pocas horas.

La situación se suma a un reportaje reciente de The New York Times que señalaba una notable disminución en la energía y actividad de Trump en comparación con su primer mandato, algo que ha irritado profundamente al presidente.

Personas desempleadas, como Sofía, se ven obligadas a recurrir a intermediarios que cobran entre 30 y 99 euros por citas que deberían ser gratuitas. Estos intermediarios utilizan herramientas informáticas y bots para reservar múltiples citas, revendiéndolas después a quienes las necesitan con urgencia, lo que genera un colapso adicional en el servicio público. El Ministerio de Trabajo ha presentado denuncias ante la Policía y ha implementado medidas antifraude, como límites por DNI y liberación aleatoria de citas canceladas, aunque los sindicatos alertan de que la raíz del problema es la falta de personal. Entre 2022 y 2025, el SEPE ha perdido miles de empleados por jubilación y recortes, mientras la demanda de citas sigue creciendo.

Este resurgimiento ha generado tanto entusiasmo como preocupación, especialmente por los posibles ataques a personas y daños económicos en comunidades rurales. Sin embargo, los autores subrayan que gran parte del debate público se ha vuelto sensacionalista, polarizado y alejado de la evidencia científica. Las poblaciones de lobos y osos aumentan de manera gradual y desigual, y los ataques mortales a humanos son extremadamente raros. La investigación demuestra que las estrategias no letales —como cercados eléctricos, perros guardianes y vigilancia del ganado— son efectivas para reducir conflictos y promover la coexistencia. La eliminación selectiva de individuos conflictivos puede ser necesaria en casos específicos, pero no debe basarse en percepciones o presiones políticas.

Abbott ha instado a los usuarios a comprobar si sus dispositivos están implicados en la incidencia mediante la web FreeStyleCheck.com, donde pueden solicitar un reemplazo gratuito. La FDA ha calificado el problema como “potencialmente de alto riesgo” y ha recomendado dejar de usar y desechar inmediatamente los sensores defectuosos.

El profesional aprovechó que a una de las figuras angelicales le faltaba un brazo para reconstruirlo y colocar en su mano un smartphone, algo que, en palabras del edil, simboliza un objeto cotidiano que todos llevamos hoy en día.

Gracias a una política de salud pública que limitaba la vacuna a personas de exactamente 79 años en ese momento, se creó un 'experimento natural' comparable a un ensayo aleatorio: quienes cumplían 80 años justo antes no eran elegibles, mientras que los que lo hacían después sí. Esto permitió comparar grupos similares salvo por la vacunación, eliminando sesgos como hábitos más saludables en vacunados. [attached_file:1][web:3]

Los resultados, publicados en Nature y un seguimiento en Cell, muestran que quienes recibieron la vacuna tuvieron un 37% menos de herpes zóster y un 20% menos probabilidades de desarrollar demencia en siete años.

La ministra de Acción y Modernización Públicas, Vanessa Matz (Les Engagés), publicó una circular obligando a eliminar todas las apps de DeepSeek de los dispositivos de trabajo antes de esa fecha.

El ave fue avistada en la cubierta 16 del Sky Princess por Charlene Halsey y sus hijas, quienes la encontraron 'temblando' bajo un escalón del jacuzzi mientras el barco se dirigía a Portland, Dorset. La familia la mantuvo en su camarote durante la noche y la entregó a un conservacionista de fauna al llegar al puerto. El corncrake, un ave ligeramente más grande que un mirlo, suele habitar en tierra seca y se cree que subió a bordo mientras el crucero navegaba por el Mediterráneo. La familia, tras informarse sobre la especie, descubrió su rareza y la llamó Aaron Burrd.

La deuda pública, que pasó del 40% del PIB en 2008 al 102,5% en 2015 pese a la austeridad, se ha estabilizado en el 103,4% en 2025, solo un punto más tras una década. En las comunidades autónomas, ha bajado del 24% al 21% del PIB gracias a mayores transferencias del Gobierno central. La deuda privada destaca por su fuerte reducción: la de hogares cae del 76% del PIB en la recesión a menos del 44% en 2025, por debajo de la media europea, ya que las familias usan sus mayores ingresos para amortizar. Las empresas han recortado 34 puntos desde el 97% en 2014, también bajo la media de la UE. Como resultado, la deuda externa neta alcanza el 44% del PIB, su mínimo desde 2001, tras bajar 28 puntos desde 2019.

La pieza, de poco más de un minuto, ha desatado una oleada de comentarios irónicos y críticas en redes sociales, donde muchos usuarios han recordado los escándalos que marcaron el final de su reinado: su implicación en casos de fraude fiscal, blanqueo de capitales y el polémico episodio de caza de elefantes en Botsuana. 

El tono del vídeo y su contenido han despertado indignación generalizada, ya que numerosos internautas consideran que el antiguo monarca no está en posición de dar lecciones de historia o ética a las nuevas generaciones. En plataformas como X (antes Twitter), la expresión '¿Por qué no te callas?' –aquella que pronunció en 2007 contra Hugo Chávez– se ha convertido en lema de la reacción popular ante su reaparición pública.

En este artículo, Agustín Guillamón narra varias historias relacionadas con este edificio emblemático de la represión franquista. Entre ellas, destaca la detención de trotskistas en febrero de 1938, implicando a Julián Grimau, quien sería posteriormente una figura clave en la lucha antifranquista. Además, se relata la huida de otros militantes, como el trotskista danés Kielso, entre la Plaza Berenguer y la Casa CNT-FAI, situada en Vía Layetana 32.

Además, otras mujeres como Leila, de 24 años, reconocen que el control sobre las chicas es estructural y difícil de denunciar, ya que ocurre en el ámbito privado, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-adolescentes-del-raval-luchan-por-tener-la-misma-libertad-que-los-chicos-para-salir-a-la-calle</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-adolescentes-del-raval-luchan-por-tener-la-misma-libertad-que-los-chicos-para-salir-a-la-calle</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 01:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alumnas del Conservatorio denuncian acoso y comportamientos inapropiados de un profesor de clarinete]]></title><description><![CDATA[Varias alumnas del Real Conservatorio Superior de Música de Madrid han denunciado tocamientos, acoso en redes sociales y comentarios sexuales por parte del catedrático de clarinete Pedro Garbajosa. Los testimonios, recogidos por el diario El Mundo, relatan situaciones de contacto físico no consentido y un ambiente de intimidación dentro de las clases. Las estudiantes afirman haber sufrido comportamientos repetidos a lo largo de los años, y aunque algunas solicitaron un cambio de profesor, el miedo y la falta de respuesta institucional las mantuvieron en silencio mucho tiempo. En un acto académico reciente, un grupo de alumnas interrumpió la ceremonia en la que Garbajosa recibía una distinción por sus 20 años de servicio, acusándole públicamente de acoso. El profesor, según las alumnas, utilizaba el contacto físico como pretexto pedagógico y hacía comentarios sexuales directos.

Hernández fue extraditado en abril de 2022 y en marzo de 2024 fue condenado a 45 años de prisión por tres cargos de narcotráfico y armas, además de cinco años de libertad vigilada y una multa de ocho millones de dólares. Según las autoridades estadounidenses, Hernández habría recibido dinero del narcotraficante Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán para financiar fraudes electorales, participando en una conspiración que introdujo más de 500 toneladas de cocaína en Honduras. La liberación se produjo el 1 de diciembre de 2025 en una prisión federal de alta seguridad en Pensilvania. El indulto, anunciado días antes de las elecciones presidenciales hondureñas, ha generado críticas por debilitar la lucha contra el narcotráfico, aunque defensores de Hernández señalan posibles irregularidades en su juicio y alegan persecución ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-orlando-hernandez-expresidente-de-honduras-liberado-tras-recibir-un-indulto-presidencial-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-orlando-hernandez-expresidente-de-honduras-liberado-tras-recibir-un-indulto-presidencial-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La separación de poderes en España: ¿realidad o ficción?]]></title><description><![CDATA[La separación de poderes es un principio fundamental en las democracias modernas que busca evitar la concentración de poder en una sola entidad. En España, la Constitución establece la división de poderes en tres ramas: legislativa, ejecutiva y judicial. Sin embargo, a pesar de la teoría, diversos factores políticos han diluido la independencia de estos poderes. La falta de independencia real del poder judicial, las interferencias del ejecutivo en el legislativo a través de decretos-ley y la elección política de los miembros clave del poder judicial muestran una realidad alejada de la separación de poderes ideal. En particular, los partidos políticos, tanto el PSOE como el PP, han sostenido un sistema que permite una influencia mutua entre los poderes, reduciendo la autonomía del judicial y la verdadera representación del poder legislativo. La concentración de poder en manos del ejecutivo y la politización de la justicia generan un sentimiento de desconfianza entre la ciudadanía, lo qu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-separacion-de-poderes-en-espana-realidad-o-ficcion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-separacion-de-poderes-en-espana-realidad-o-ficcion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump endurece su discurso y anuncia posibles operaciones terrestres contra redes de narcotráfico en Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha vuelto a elevar la tensión con Venezuela al anunciar que su gobierno se prepara para iniciar operaciones terrestres contra supuestos narcotraficantes que operan desde ese país. Durante una comparecencia en la Casa Blanca, Trump afirmó que los ataques por tierra comenzarán 'muy pronto' y utilizó un lenguaje especialmente agresivo al referirse a los objetivos de la operación, asegurando que 'acabarán' con ellos. Según el mandatario, las redes criminales venezolanas serían responsables de más de 200.000 muertes el año anterior en Estados Unidos, una cifra que empleó para justificar esta escalada. 

La ofensiva se enmarcaría en la operación Lanza del Sur, un dispositivo militar del Pentágono que, hasta la fecha, ha destruido una veintena de embarcaciones en aguas del Caribe y el Pacífico y ha provocado la muerte extrajudicial de más de 80 personas señaladas como narcotraficantes.

El cartel promovía la candidatura presidencial de William Z. Foster, un destacado organizador sindical y figura clave del Partido Comunista, y la de James W.

El incidente no es el primero de este tipo, aunque previamente las deserciones habían ocurrido en las instalaciones de la Sierra del Retín. A diferencia de otros casos, el soldado desertor pertenece a un cuerpo de élite del ejército ucraniano. El TEAR, que actualmente alberga a menos soldados debido a la reducción de los contingentes, les permite salir algunas tardes, pero el sábado uno de los soldados no regresó tras su permiso. Inmediatamente las autoridades iniciaron su búsqueda, pero dos días después aún no han logrado localizarlo.

Entre los cambios más destacados, se incluyen la transferencia de competencias en protección de datos al organismo que debería proteger estos derechos, la dependencia directa del Gobierno en lugar de la Asamblea y la eliminación de sanciones por incumplimiento. Esto ha reducido la capacidad de supervisión de los diputados y del público en general, dificultando el acceso a información sobre el uso de los fondos públicos y la actividad de altos cargos.

Fox no fue el primer actor elegido para interpretar a Marty McFly; Eric Stoltz comenzó el rodaje, pero fue reemplazado por Fox debido a que su estilo serio no encajaba con la comedia de la cinta. La película anticipó inventos que hoy son reales, como coches voladores, patines eléctricos, videoconferencias, gafas inteligentes y ropa conectada, aunque algunas de estas tecnologías no se han desarrollado exactamente como se imaginaban.

Los hechos se remontan al 12 de noviembre, cuando Quiles convocó a sus seguidores a un acto no autorizado frente a la Facultad de Ciencias Políticas de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Según ACO, esa convocatoria derivó en un asalto a las instalaciones universitarias, con actos de hostigamiento al profesorado y daños a la propiedad. La denuncia señala que los discursos y consignas promovidos por Quiles en redes sociales y actos públicos tenían un claro contenido ideológico y generaron un clima de confrontación. Durante el mitin, algunos asistentes profirieron insultos y gritaron consignas contra la izquierda, mientras otros realizaron saludos fascistas y pintadas con mensajes franquistas en los pasillos del centro.

Aunque esta expansión tiene una gran carga geopolítica detrás, la viabilidad económica del proyecto ha sido fuertemente cuestionada por su fundador, Morris Chang. Según Chang, el éxito de TSMC se debe a su ecosistema único y altamente concentrado en Taiwán, donde la cercanía de empresas y proveedores permite una eficiencia sin igual. En Arizona, la falta de infraestructura local y el elevado coste de producción están dificultando este objetivo, además de que el suministro de materias primas sigue dependiendo de Asia. El intento de replicar el modelo taiwanés en EE.UU. ha resultado ser más caro y con una menor eficacia. A pesar de que TSMC sigue siendo una empresa mayoritariamente taiwanesa, los proyectos en Arizona, Japón y Alemania intentan satisfacer demandas especializadas, aunque con limi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-expansion-de-tsmc-en-arizona-un-reto-por-la-falta-de-ecosistema-y-costes-elevados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-expansion-de-tsmc-en-arizona-un-reto-por-la-falta-de-ecosistema-y-costes-elevados</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Carlos Bardem analiza la percepción mediática de los jóvenes de extrema derecha y progresistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Carlos Bardem, conocido actor y hermano de Javier Bardem, abordó en 'La Hora de La1' su perspectiva sobre la representación de los jóvenes en los medios de comunicación, especialmente en términos políticos. Relacionó su aparición con la promoción de su nueva película 'Papeles', basada en la investigación de Los papeles de Panamá, que reveló millones de euros ocultos al fisco por parte de grandes fortunas. Bardem criticó que los medios suelen centrarse en mostrar a jóvenes de extrema derecha como un fenómeno predominante, mientras que los jóvenes progresistas involucrados en causas medioambientales, sindicales o de justicia social no reciben la misma cobertura. Puso como ejemplo que cuando un individuo de extrema derecha provoca disturbios en una universidad, se muestran imágenes de estos pocos, pero no de los cientos o miles de estudiantes progresistas presentes. Además, Bardem analizó cómo este enfoque mediático puede estar incentivado tanto por la derecha, para desmotivar a la ciudad]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/carlos-bardem-analiza-la-percepcion-mediatica-de-los-jovenes-de-extrema-derecha-y-progresistas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/carlos-bardem-analiza-la-percepcion-mediatica-de-los-jovenes-de-extrema-derecha-y-progresistas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 20:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Petro acusa a Estados Unidos de cometer crímenes de lesa humanidad en el Caribe]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Colombia, Gustavo Petro, ha criticado de forma contundente las operaciones militares llevadas a cabo por Estados Unidos en aguas del Caribe, afirmando que constituyen un 'asesinato sistemático' y, por tanto, un delito de lesa humanidad.

Petro sostiene que las órdenes emitidas por el secretario de Defensa estadounidense, Pete Hegseth, habrían desembocado directamente en la muerte de civiles caribeños.

Esta no es la primera vez que el Ministerio Público solicita la disolución del partido, ya que lo ha hecho en tres ocasiones anteriores (2012, 2016, 2020). El KPP es un pequeño partido sin representación parlamentaria, pero con una presencia activa en la calle, defendiendo causas como los derechos laborales y la crítica a la OTAN. La acción contra el KPP ha sido vista por algunos como un ejemplo de 'antitotalitarismo selectivo', ya que existen otros grupos de extrema derecha en el país que siguen operando sin restricciones.

El empleado, con 16 años de servicio y un expediente laboral intachable, admitió haber tomado una croqueta de un blíster que iba a ser tirado a la basura. Mercadona consideró el acto como una falta muy grave, alegando transgresión de la buena fe contractual, y procedió a despedirle de forma inmediata, entregándole un finiquito de algo más de 900 euros.

Esta cifra coloca a la región muy por delante de otras comunidades comparables, como Madrid, que ingresó 546 millones, y Andalucía, con 231 millones. Cataluña representa así el 35% del total recaudado en España por este impuesto, a pesar de aplicar deducciones para los familiares más cercanos. Sin embargo, estas bonificaciones son inferiores a las de otras comunidades, lo que hace que heredar en Cataluña sea más costoso que en la mayoría de regiones. Por ejemplo, un ciudadano que reciba 800.000 euros de herencia pagaría 44.569 euros en Cataluña, frente a 1.586 euros en Madrid o cero en Andalucía.

Según la organización, la acción no implicó violencia ni intimidación, sino que buscaba visibilizar la crisis climática, denunciar políticas extractivistas y reclamar justicia ecosocial. Futuro Vegetal denuncia que la petición de la Fiscalía forma parte de una represión sistemática contra el activismo ecosocial, recordando que en 2023 la Fiscalía incluso calificó erróneamente sus acciones como “actividad terrorista”, rectificando después la acusación.

La investigación busca ampliar el vocabulario y la comprensión científica sobre el placer femenino, ya que históricamente el estudio del sexo anal se ha centrado casi exclusivamente en la penetración pene-anal, los riesgos o el estigma asociados. El equipo investigador identificó tres formas principales de tocamiento placentero: el 'tacto anal superficial' o 'anal surfacing', que consiste en caricias externas en la zona del ano sin penetrar; el 'tacto anal somero' o 'anal shallowing', que implica una penetración muy leve, hasta la yema de un dedo o el primer nudillo; y el 'maridaje anal' o 'anal pairing', que combina la estimulación anal con otros tipos de placer simultáneos, como la vaginal o clitoriana.

Dos de los detenidos ya tenían antecedentes policiales por delitos de agresión sexual, lo que ha influido en la decisión judicial de aplicar la prisión preventiva para evitar posibles fugas o reincidencia. Los hechos sucedieron a principios de octubre, cuando la joven, estudiante procedente de Almería, conoció a uno de los agresores en un local nocturno. Tras salir juntos, fueron seguidos por los otros dos sospechosos, que presuntamente participaron en la agresión sexual.

La mujer denunció más de tres décadas de maltrato, durante las cuales también sufrió agresiones sexuales, abuso económico y psicológico.

La organización, gestionada por la empresa 9Art+ desde 2008, anunció que el certamen no podría celebrarse en las condiciones adecuadas, después de que más de 2.000 autores decidieran boicotearlo en protesta por la gestión de la empresa y por el despido injustificado de una empleada que había denunciado una violación. El boicot se amplió a las editoriales, y las autoridades públicas retiraron las subvenciones, que representan casi la mitad del presupuesto del festival. Este hecho marca la primera suspensión del certamen desde su creación en 1974, salvo el año de la pandemia. El director de 9Art+, Franck Bondoux, dimitió tras la polémica, pero la decisión de cancelar el festival ya era irreversible. Las autoridades, incluido el alcalde de Angulema, reconocieron la dificultad de mantener el evento bajo la gestión actual.

Sin embargo, su nuevo objetivo no es solo aumentar la cantidad de ingenieros, sino acelerar la formación de los de mayor nivel académico: los doctorados. Las universidades chinas han comenzado a adoptar un nuevo modelo en el que los estudiantes pueden obtener el título de PhD no mediante una tesis teórica, sino mediante el desarrollo de productos y sistemas reales aplicables a la industria. Este enfoque, impulsado por instituciones como la Universidad Tecnológica de Harbin, busca reducir los tiempos de formación y reforzar la conexión entre academia y empresa en áreas estratégicas.

Tras la sentencia del Tribunal Supremo que revocó fallos anteriores que negaban la restitución, los herederos del dictador aceptaron devolver los bienes, sufragando ellos mismos los 4.350 euros del traslado desde el Pazo de Meirás hasta la ciudad. La alcaldesa Goretti Sanmartín y otros responsables municipales supervisaron el embalaje y traslado de las esculturas, destacando el carácter pionero y simbólico de la devolución, que abre camino a la restitución de otros bienes expoliados por el franquismo.

El robo habría tenido lugar en 2020, cuando el grupo LuBian, uno de los mayores pools de minería de Bitcoin, sufrió un hackeo masivo, perdiendo más del 90% de sus fondos. Estos fondos, sin embargo, no fueron movidos durante varios años, hasta que, en junio de 2024, se realizó una transferencia a una nueva cartera. En octubre de 2025, el Departamento de Justicia de EE.

Según Maldonado, esta metodología es obsoleta y limitada porque considera únicamente los ingresos monetarios en relación con una canasta básica de 52 alimentos, sin contemplar gastos fundamentales como servicios públicos, educación, salud, transporte y combustible. Esta medición oficial arroja una tasa de pobreza del 31,6% para 2025, pero otras mediciones multidimensionales, como la elaborada por la Universidad Católica Argentina, estiman que la pobreza real alcanza el 67,5%. El experto explica que cambiar la metodología tendría consecuencias políticas complicadas, ya que implicaría reconocer un porcentaje de pobreza mucho mayor, lo que demandaría mayores recursos para asignaciones y planes sociales.

La preocupación de Washington radica en que el artefacto, al ser un modelo avanzado fabricado por Boeing, podría ser recuperado por actores no estatales o transferido a países como Rusia o China, interesados en obtener información técnica sobre su diseño y sistemas de guiado. La GBU-39 es una bomba planeadora de precisión que, una vez lanzada, despliega alas que le permiten desplazarse hasta 110 kilómetros sin necesidad de motor propio, lo que la convierte en un componente clave de los arsenales modernos de largo alcance. La noticia surge en el contexto de una creciente tensión regional que involucra a Israel, Hezbollah y otros actores en el Líbano.

Las denunciantes, trabajadoras en Moncloa, describen un ambiente laboral hostil, plagado de comentarios sexuales, gestos obscenos y conductas humillantes. Ambas mujeres relataron haber sufrido acoso reiterado y la indiferencia de los mecanismos internos del partido, que no tramitaron sus quejas ni ofrecieron apoyo. Los testimonios detallan cómo Salazar hacía comentarios sobre el cuerpo, el escote o el vestuario de las empleadas, además de recrear actos sexuales en su despacho y ejercer su poder para castigar a quienes intentaban poner límites. Las afectadas aseguran que temían represalias y que el propio Salazar presumía de su posición de confianza junto al presidente del Gobierno.

El juez Francisco de Jorge Mesas instruirá estas diligencias para determinar la naturaleza de los hechos, identificar a los responsables y establecer el procedimiento aplicable. Los querellantes consideran que los hechos podrían constituir delitos de detención ilegal, piratería, tortura y crímenes de lesa humanidad, incluso genocidio.

Según el almirante italiano Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, presidente del comité militar de la alianza, la organización podría pasar de una estrategia reactiva a una más agresiva, con el objetivo de frenar las amenazas rusas en el ciberespacio y el aire. Sin embargo, la OTAN enfrenta retos debido a las limitaciones legales, éticas y de jurisdicción, que dificultan su respuesta frente a la agresividad de Moscú. A pesar de estos obstáculos, la disuasión mediante represalias o ataques preventivos se está considerando como una opción viable. Un ejemplo de esta estrategia preventiva es la misión Baltic Sentry, que patrulla el mar Báltico para evitar incidentes similares a los ocurridos en los últimos años, en los que se ha atribuido a la flota rusa la responsabilidad de evadir sanciones.

En la vía pública, el chico fue acompañado por otros dos hombres, quienes, según la investigación, obligaron a la víctima a mantener relaciones sexuales no consentidas. Tras la denuncia, se activó el protocolo de atención a víctimas de agresión sexual, y la joven fue atendida en un hospital.

Esta demanda surge tras el cierre de puntos de acceso al agua instalados con donativos, lo que obliga a los trabajadores a recorrer largas distancias con garrafas para abastecerse tras jornadas laborales arduas en los invernaderos. Aunque el Ayuntamiento asegura que no ha cortado el suministro general, la situación real muestra un acceso deficiente y escaso, con colas largas y reducción del caudal disponible.

Ekaizer sostiene que Ayuso recurre sistemáticamente a acusaciones, insinuaciones y denuncias sin base sólida, cuyo objetivo principal sería provocar un ambiente de confrontación y aumentar la polarización. En su opinión, este enfoque busca crear un ruido político permanente, capaz de influir en la opinión pública y deteriorar la confianza en las instituciones.

En particular, la segmentación de sus servicios, como la creación de distintas categorías de trenes (AVE, Avant, Media Distancia, etc.), genera confusión y molestias entre los pasajeros, afectando la conveniencia y la flexibilidad. Además, se critica que los horarios de los trenes, especialmente en rutas menos frecuentadas como la de Valladolid-Madrid o Badajoz-Cáceres, son poco prácticos y no ofrecen un servicio eficiente. En estos trayectos, la opción más adecuada sería tener una tarifa única con trenes en horarios fijos, más cercanos a la demanda real de los usuarios.

Los fármacos, como los que contienen GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy o Mounjaro), pueden ser eficaces, pero solo cuando se usan con supervisión médica y a largo plazo. Sin embargo, la OMS señala la gran desigualdad en el acceso a estos medicamentos, ya que, aunque su eficacia está probada, solo una pequeña parte de la población mundial tiene acceso a ellos.

Solo un 9% de los trabajadores del sector tiene menos de 30 años, lo que evidencia la falta de relevo generacional. La combinación de salarios ajustados, condiciones laborales duras y ausencia de formación suficiente ha generado un desajuste estructural que limita la contratación de jóvenes y la adopción de nuevas tecnologías. Los salarios han experimentado incrementos moderados debido al aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional y la presión por la escasez laboral, pero todavía resultan insuficientes para atraer a personal cualificado. La situación se agrava porque la mayoría de las empresas del sector son pymes o autónomos, incapaces de asumir costes salariales más altos, lo que provoca listas de espera y ralentiza el crecimiento del sector.

El contrato de alquiler especificaba que ciertos gastos individualizados, incluidos el IBI y las tasas de basuras, eran responsabilidad del arrendatario. Inicialmente, un juzgado dio la razón a los inquilinos alegando que la falta de especificación del importe anual invalidaba la obligación de pago. Posteriormente, la Audiencia Provincial de Palma de Mallorca revocó la decisión, considerando que estos tributos sí son individualizables y, por tanto, los inquilinos debían pagarlos.

A finales de junio de 2025 había 80.648 solicitudes pendientes de homologación, generando un retraso considerable en los procedimientos. Aunque en el primer semestre de 2025 se aceleró el número de resoluciones, el Tribunal considera que los mecanismos actuales son insuficientes, tanto a nivel de recursos humanos como tecnológicos. Desde 2024, se reciben aproximadamente 30.000 solicitudes anuales, lo que dificulta reducir la acumulación y cumplir los plazos de resolución. La recomendación incluye aplicar a los extracomunitarios el mismo régimen que a los nacionales de la UE o eliminar la homologación previa en casos de necesidad especial y experiencia de cinco a quince años.

Las fotos fueron requisadas, pero Vázquez Taín se puso en contacto con el PP para frenar su difusión, y años más tarde, tras su publicación por El País en 2013, ofreció una entrevista a El Mundo defendiendo a Feijóo. Ahora, doce años después de estos hechos, Vázquez Taín ha sido invitado como ponente principal en las jornadas jurídicas organizadas por OkDiario y financiadas por el Partido Popular, un evento que también contó con la participación de abogados de Koldo García Izaguirre y José Luis Ábalos.

Según Navarro, el principal problema urbano es la saturación de las vías y la falta de espacio, por lo que considera que permitir la entrada de coches eléctricos no resolvería los atascos. Su propuesta se centra en promover el transporte público como la principal alternativa para acceder a las zonas céntricas, complementado por opciones como taxis, servicios de VTC o desplazamientos a pie y en bicicleta.

El Consejo de Estudiantes de la UMA denuncia una infrafinanciación estructural que sitúa a la institución entre las peor financiadas de Andalucía y de España, con un déficit acumulado superior a los 216 millones de euros. Esta falta de recursos se refleja en aulas saturadas, laboratorios obsoletos, prácticas insuficientes, escasez de material básico e imposibilidad de estabilizar al profesorado. Paralelamente, el elevado precio del alquiler en Málaga —con habitaciones por encima de los 500 euros— dificulta que los estudiantes puedan continuar sus estudios en la ciudad, ante la falta de medidas de regulación o soluciones habitacionales por parte de la administración autonómica.

Las denuncias fueron registradas correctamente, pero cuando las denunciantes intentaron hacer seguimiento en octubre y noviembre, el sistema indicaba que no existían. La dirección del PSOE admite una 'falta de diligencia' y atribuye la desaparición de los registros a un error informático y a un sistema que entra en modo de 'ofuscación' para proteger datos tras tres meses.

Tras más de dos décadas trabajando como panadero, su pensión mensual asciende a 900 euros, calculada únicamente en función de los años cotizados. En la entrevista con NoticiasTrabajo, Oswaldo critica la desigualdad del sistema de pensiones, comparando su situación con la de los autónomos, quienes pueden trabajar 30 o 40 años y jubilarse con cantidades aún más bajas. Además, destaca la disparidad de salarios y coste de vida entre regiones y países europeos, mencionando que su hija en Francia gana más aunque los precios allí son mayores. Durante su etapa laboral, Oswaldo trabajaba jornadas extremadamente largas y nocturnas, de 12:30 de la noche a 12 del mediodía, cobrando 1.500 euros mensuales, aunque estima que el valor real de su trabajo debería haber sido de 2.000 a 2.500 euros por las horas extras no remuneradas.

En el caso de Italia, los salarios reales han caído un 3,4% entre 1991 y 2023, mientras que en España la mejora ha sido mínima, con un aumento del poder adquisitivo de apenas un 2-3%. Las razones de este estancamiento se deben a un modelo productivo de bajo valor añadido, la debilidad de la negociación colectiva, la externalización de trabajos, y la devaluación del trabajo para ganar competitividad. Aunque en España el aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI) desde 2018 ha generado una mejora significativa para muchos trabajadores, esta subida no ha sido suficiente para alterar la estructura salarial desigual del país.

Las autoridades recibieron el aviso a las 22:15 horas y enviaron patrullas de Policía Nacional y ambulancias del SUMMA 112 al lugar. Tras encontrar el cuerpo del hombre en la acera, los agentes entraron al apartamento y localizaron a la mujer con múltiples heridas. Varios vecinos informaron de haber oído discusiones previas, aunque no se tiene constancia de denuncias por violencia doméstica. La investigación está siendo llevada a cabo por el Grupo de Homicidios de la Policía Nacional.

La cineasta habló en particular sobre la emblemática escena de la pastilla roja y la pastilla azul, que fue utilizada por la ideología de derecha para distorsionar su mensaje original. Wachowski explicó que lo que hace el fascismo es apropiarse de ideas y verdades universales y retorcarlas para propósitos ideológicos.

El entonces dueño de OHL, Juan Miguel Villar Mir, fue su principal beneficiado, tras haber protagonizado una controvertida operación de compra de un cuadro de Goya al marido de Aguirre. Más de una década después, los protagonistas políticos se han retirado, y el complejo ha quedado dividido entre OHLA y el fondo israelí Mohari, propiedad de Isai Scheinberg, fundador de Poker Stars. Mohari explotará el hotel Four Seasons, la tienda de Hermès y parte del aparcamiento, mientras que OHLA gestionará la galería comercial y la zona de restauración.

Hedren y su esposo, Noel Marshall, adoptaron a Neil mientras rodaban una película sobre la conservación de especies salvajes. A lo largo de los años, las fotos capturaron momentos sorprendentes de Neil conviviendo con la familia, como nadando en la piscina, compartiendo la cama o incluso jugando con Melanie Griffith, la hija de Hedren. Esta convivencia poco convencional fue documentada en la revista Life y reveló los riesgos y desafíos de vivir con un animal salvaje. A pesar de las advertencias de expertos en animales, Hedren y Marshall crearon un proyecto cinematográfico basado en su experiencia con los felinos. Aunque la película 'Roar' fue un fracaso comercial, impulsó la creación de la fundación sin ánimo de lucro The Roar Foundation y el Shambala Preserve, un refugio para animales exóticos.

El tribunal ha dictaminado que la mujer mantenía una convivencia estable con una nueva pareja, lo que constituye causa suficiente para extinguir dicha pensión conforme al artículo 101 del Código Civil. La resolución se ha basado en un informe elaborado por un detective privado, en el que se demostraba que la mujer residía habitualmente en la vivienda de su nueva pareja. Además, el informe confirmó que la casa donde estaba empadronada tras el divorcio se encontraba alquilada, y que una agencia inmobiliaria corroboró ese extremo. Con estos elementos, la Audiencia consideró probada una convivencia de tipo marital, pública y duradera —conocida en derecho como 'more uxorio'—, lo que justifica la eliminación de la pensión sin necesidad de acreditar una mejora económica derivada de la relación.

La tendencia hacia la abstinencia entre los adolescentes es notable, con un descenso del 24% en los últimos 30 años en el número de jóvenes que se emborrachan regularmente. A pesar de la reducción en los precios del alcohol, los consumidores no muestran señales de volver al consumo masivo, lo que ha afectado gravemente a marcas como Pernod Ricard y Diageo.

En lugar de construir un mensaje positivo y propositivo, el PP sigue centrado en atacar a Pedro Sánchez, sin ofrecer una alternativa clara o una visión de futuro para el país. Esto, afirma Sánchez, está agotando a sus seguidores, ya que las continuas protestas no generan cambios visibles ni avances en sus objetivos. Además, sostiene que cada nueva manifestación refuerza la imagen de un PP impotente y atrapado en un bucle emocional. Mientras tanto, Pedro Sánchez mantiene una posición estable y centrada, a pesar de la oposición. El analista también apunta que, aunque las protestas fortalecen a la militancia socialista, desgastan a los votantes populares, que se sienten f]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-error-del-pp-en-sus-manifestaciones-segun-un-analista-de-comunicacion-politica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-error-del-pp-en-sus-manifestaciones-segun-un-analista-de-comunicacion-politica</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 06:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Conmoción en Jaén por el suicidio de dos adolescentes que podrían haber sufrido acoso escolar]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dos adolescentes de 15 y 16 años fueron halladas sin vida en un parque de Jaén durante la madrugada del sábado, en un suceso que ha conmocionado profundamente a la ciudad. Según testimonios de amigos y compañeros recogidos por EFE, ambas jóvenes podrían haber sufrido acoso escolar. Un amigo de una de las fallecidas declaró que ella había padecido bullying en su anterior instituto, El Valle, y que aún no se había recuperado del daño emocional. También señaló que la otra chica vivía una situación similar. No obstante, la Consejería de Educación ha informado de que no existen denuncias previas en los centros y ha pedido prudencia, dado que la investigación se encuentra bajo secreto de sumario. La Policía Nacional ha confirmado que las muertes fueron suicidios y que no se han hallado signos de violencia ni indicios de participación de terceras personas.

La organización facilitaba pasaportes falsos de personas con características similares a las de los menores para sortear los controles fronterizos. La mujer, que utilizaba múltiples identidades para viajar entre Somalia y Europa, fue arrestada en un hotel del distrito de Sant Martí, donde se encontraba con dos menores. Los niños usaban pasaportes de otras personas para viajar sin levantar sospechas. Tras la detención, los menores fueron trasladados a un centro de protección infantil, mientras que la arrestada enfrentará cargos por explotación y vulneración de derechos de los menores.

La ministra Pilar Alegría señaló que si el PP realmente quería protestar contra la corrupción, debieron haberlo hecho frente a su sede en la Calle Génova, considerada por el Ejecutivo como el 'kilómetro cero' de la corrupción, debido a su vinculación con el caso Gürtel y la caja B. Alegría criticó también que el PP no haya mostrado interés en manifestarse por temas como la sanidad pública o la educación. En la misma línea, el ministro Félix Bolaños acusó al PP de coincidir cada vez más con Vox en su discurso y estrategias, lo que refuerza la idea de que ambos partidos son 'indistinguibles'. La protesta, que contaba con 80.000 asistentes según el PP, fue más pequeña que las anteriores, lo que también fue motivo de ironía por parte del Gobierno.

De acuerdo con un informe de la inmobiliaria Lucas Fox, casi cuatro de cada diez viviendas de lujo adquiridas en España son para primera residencia, una tendencia impulsada por nómadas digitales, emprendedores y ciudadanos de América Latina, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Las ciudades como Madrid, Barcelona y Málaga están viendo el crecimiento más notable en este tipo de compras.

Esta cifra, una estimación conservadora, supera el techo presupuestario del Ministerio de Defensa, estancado en unos 14.000 millones debido a la ausencia de Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Las aprobaciones incluyen proyectos como fragatas F-110, vehículos blindados Dragón, drones Euromale RPAS, aviones Eurofighter en el Programa Halcón, misiles Nasams, satélites PAZ II y el controvertido FCAS, un caza europeo de sexta generación, con compromisos que se extienden hasta 2042 [attached_file:1].

El aumento se aceleró desde 2022, impulsado por la guerra en Ucrania y el compromiso OTAN del 2% del PIB en defensa, que España prevé alcanzar en 2025 con unos 33.000 millones, duplicando el 0,92% de 2014.

Esta cifra, un récord absoluto, pone de manifiesto el aumento de la violencia extrema de los colonos, que no solo agreden a palestinos, sino que también atacan a las propias tropas israelíes. A pesar de que el gobierno de Netanyahu ha prometido una 'mano dura' contra estos extremistas, el conflicto parece haber alcanzado un punto crítico. La violencia, que incluye desde quemas hasta asesinatos, tiene su epicentro en las microcolonias ilegales, apoyadas por el gobierno, y ha desbordado las fronteras de Cisjordania.

A nivel global, la humanidad está utilizando los recursos naturales a un ritmo 1,8 veces superior a la capacidad de regeneración de la Tierra. Uruguay, sin embargo, destaca como un modelo positivo debido a su transición energética, que ha logrado que el 99,1% de su electricidad provenga de fuentes renovables. A través de su experiencia, Wackernagel señala que si todos los países siguieran el ejemplo de Uruguay, el planeta entraría en déficit ecológico mucho más tarde, lo que permitiría un uso más sostenible de los recursos. La clave de esta transformación en Uruguay fue una combinación de políticas públicas de largo plazo, una gobernanza de colaboración público-privada y una profunda revisión del marco regulatorio para facilitar el uso de energías renovables.

Este acuerdo ha reavivado la polémica sobre la adquisición de la entidad en 1992 por parte de Jesús Gil y Enrique Cerezo, quienes accedieron a la propiedad en un proceso judicialmente calificado como un “fraude de ley”. A pesar de que los tribunales confirmaron que el proceso de compra fue ilegal, las acciones de los nuevos propietarios fueron prescritas, lo que permitió que continuaran al frente del club. Este caso se remonta a la conversión del Atlético de Madrid en una Sociedad Anónima Deportiva, cuando las autoridades deportivas permitieron que Gil y Cerezo se hicieran con el control del club a través de un complejo entramado financiero.

Entre 2010 y 2017, se pasó de un proceso de absorción de CO2 a una emisión neta de gases de efecto invernadero. Esto se debe principalmente a la destrucción de la selva tropical del Congo, la segunda más grande del mundo después del Amazonas, que ha experimentado una deforestación masiva debido a la tala ilegal y la minería. De hecho, entre 2011 y 2017, los bosques africanos perdieron 106 millones de toneladas de biomasa por año, lo que equivaldría a la emisión de unos 200 millones de toneladas de CO2. Este cambio pone en peligro los esfuerzos globales para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, ya que la región, anteriormente un importante sumidero de carbono, ahora se ha convertido en una fuente de emisiones.

Una furgoneta atropelló a un repartidor de la empresa Glovo que circulaba en motocicleta e, increíblemente, continuó su marcha con la víctima enganchada al capó del vehículo durante varios centenares de metros. Varios conductores grabaron el suceso, que rápidamente se viralizó en redes sociales y causó una gran conmoción por su peligrosidad. En las imágenes se aprecia al repartidor tratando de aferrarse y moverse desesperadamente mientras otros vehículos hacían sonar sus claxon para alertar al conductor. Según informaciones del servicio de emergencias 112, las llamadas de testigos fueron múltiples y describieron el hecho como un atropello intencionado, o al menos extremadamente negligente. De inmediato, se desplazaron hasta la zona la Guardia Civil de Tráfico y efectivos sanitarios.

Describe una red de favores y pactos tácitos entre élites que impide reformas reales, con procesos judiciales eternos mientras el dinero público se desvanece en comisiones y contratos amañados. Destaca casos recientes como el de Koldo García, exasesor de Ábalos, implicado en una trama de mascarillas que facturó 52 millones de euros durante la pandemia; el Supremo propone juzgarlo por cohecho, malversación y organización criminal. También menciona la investigación abierta contra Begoña Gómez, esposa del presidente, por tráfico de influencias en contratos y su cátedra universitaria. En datos, Andalucía cerró 70 acusados en 12 procedimientos en 2024, la Fiscalía intervino en 885 casos en 2023 y GRECO alerta de incumplimientos en 2025, con España en su peor puesto en el Índice de Percepción de la Corrupción.

La presentación del libro en Madrid requirió la presencia de tres escoltas por amenazas previas, lo que refleja el clima de tensión alrededor del asunto. El autor sostiene que existen denuncias que se utilizan de forma instrumental para obtener ventajas legales o económicas en procesos de separación o custodia. Aunque la Fiscalía indica que solo el 0,0082% de las denuncias se consideran falsas, varios abogados y asociaciones, como Genmad, afirman que el número real es mucho mayor. Antonia Carrasco, presidenta de esta asociación, critica la Ley de Violencia de Género de 2004 y afirma que algunas mujeres la utilizan como herramienta de venganza.

El incremento de la demanda, impulsado por políticas de gratuidad parcial, bonificaciones y un cambio social hacia la movilidad sostenible, ha superado la capacidad de autobuses, metro y trenes de cercanías. Sin embargo, las inversiones para mejorar el servicio no han acompañado este auge. Según un estudio de la Universitat de València, el tráfico rodado en accesos y zonas internas de la ciudad ha caído notablemente desde 2008, mientras que el uso de bicicletas y transporte colectivo se ha disparado. Aun así, la oferta de transporte por habitante sigue siendo menos de la mitad de la de Madrid o Barcelona.

Este término, originado en la Alemania nazi, describe un sistema jurídico en el que las leyes se aplican de manera desigual según la pertenencia a ciertos colectivos. En su artículo 14, la Constitución española garantiza la igualdad ante la ley, pero la sentencia de 2008 en el caso de la Ley de Violencia de Género ha alterado este principio, aplicando un doble Derecho Penal que favorece a ciertos grupos mientras discrimina a otros, como el colectivo LGTBI+. Los críticos, como el autor Juan Soto Ivars, denuncian que este tipo de legislación ha llevado a la creación de un Derecho Penal de Autor, donde los acusados son tratados no según sus actos, sino según su pertenencia a un grupo determinado. Además, esta sentencia ha sido vinculada con otros problemas sistémicos, como el uso político de la ley y la corrupción, que afectan la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derecho-degenerado-y-la-sentencia-que-altera-los-derechos-fundamentales-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derecho-degenerado-y-la-sentencia-que-altera-los-derechos-fundamentales-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 20:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenido en Las Palmas un falso representante deportivo acusado de abusar y corromper a 61 menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía ha detenido en Las Palmas a un hombre que se hacía pasar por representante deportivo y que está acusado de abusar sexualmente y corromper a 61 menores de edad.

El informe también destaca la vulnerabilidad de áreas como la Región de Murcia, donde un 91% de su superficie está en proceso de degradación.

García desaconsejó la medida al considerarla un 'lío jurídico'. Pradas había intentado contactar previamente con Mazón a las 19:10 y 19:36 sin éxito, ya que el entonces president estaba con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana en El Ventorro y no llegó al Palau de la Generalitat hasta las 20:00 horas. En el Cecopi, la propuesta de confinamiento surgió tras descartar evacuaciones por el jefe de bomberos José Miguel Basset, quien las vio contraproducentes.

Todo ello deja a la UE en una posición de debilidad geopolítica. 

A pesar de los intentos por reforzar su autonomía estratégica —con un aumento del gasto militar, reformas para reducir la burocracia y la negociación de acuerdos comerciales como el de Mercosur—, las acciones concretas no alcanzan para invertir la tendencia.

Al principio, la población creció rápidamente y parecía una utopía, pero pronto se observaron comportamientos sociales destructivos como violencia, agresividad, aislamiento y pérdida de la función reproductiva. La sobrepoblación provocó un colapso social en la colonia, con consecuencias que llevaron a la extinción de la población.
