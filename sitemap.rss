Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by a masked ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was killed by immigration agents while filming officers at a protest. Trump stated that he felt particularly bad about Good’s death because her parents were strong supporters of him, describing them as 'tremendous Trump people.' He suggested that Good may have been 'radicalized' despite her family's political leanings. The Trump administration initially framed both victims as threats, with officials labeling Pretti as a would-be domestic terrorist and claiming Good attempted to harm agents with her vehicle. Following public backlash, the narrative around Pretti shifted to focus on his possession of a firearm. In response to the incidents, Trump sent Border Czar ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-comments-on-the-deaths-of-alex-pretti-and-renee-good-amid-minneapolis-ice-operations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-comments-on-the-deaths-of-alex-pretti-and-renee-good-amid-minneapolis-ice-operations</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guide to Locating Online Benefit Guides for Major Credit Card Issuers]]></title><description><![CDATA[When you receive a new credit card, it typically includes a physical 'Guide to Benefits' booklet that outlines purchase protections, travel insurance, and other safeguards like ID theft protection or concierge services in fine print.

To access these guides digitally for easier reference—especially for purchase and travel protections—several major issuers provide them online.

Prior to the conflict, Russia supplied 45% of the EU's gas at prices 30-50% below US liquefied natural gas. Sanctions drastically cut these imports, forcing reliance on pricier alternatives and contributing to a reported 9% loss in chemical production capacity, according to industry sources like CEFIC. Specific 2024 production declines included Germany (25%), the Netherlands (20%), the UK (12%), France (10%), and Spain (8%). The sector's heavy dependence on natural gas not only for energy but also as a raw material for key compounds like ammonia and methanol amplified the impact. Initial post-war price surges reached +833% for gas and +251% for electricity, with lingering elevated costs—European gas remains 345% more expensive than in the US, and industrial electricity up to four times higher—even after partial]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-chemical-industry-faces-significant-decline-due-to-high-energy-costs-and-reduced-russian-gas-imports</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-chemical-industry-faces-significant-decline-due-to-high-energy-costs-and-reduced-russian-gas-imports</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Severe winter storms and heavy snowfall cause at least ten deaths across Japan]]></title><description><![CDATA[Japan has been severely affected by an intense winter weather episode marked by heavy snowfall, repeated cold waves, and strong winds, resulting in at least ten fatalities across several regions. According to Japan’s Fire and Disaster Management Agency (FDMA), the deadliest impacts were recorded in Niigata Prefecture, along the Sea of Japan coast, where six people lost their lives. Two of the victims died after being struck by snow falling from rooftops in the area of Nagaoka, while four others died during snow removal operations in different parts of the prefecture.

Additional deaths were reported in the prefectures of Hokkaido, Akita, Yamagata, and Shimane, with one fatality confirmed in each location. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) explained that a series of strong cold air masses caused widespread snowfall across Hokkaido, northern Tohoku, and the Hokuriku region. Although the most intense phase of snowfall has passed, snow accumulation has already exceeded the seasonal ave]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/severe-winter-storms-and-heavy-snowfall-cause-at-least-ten-deaths-across-japan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/severe-winter-storms-and-heavy-snowfall-cause-at-least-ten-deaths-across-japan</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk Shares AI-Generated Video Demonstrating Grok Updates on X]]></title><description><![CDATA[Elon Musk recently shared a brief AI-generated video on X featuring digital versions of Sydney Sweeney and Regé-Jean Page.

The video showcases improved audio quality and demonstrates the new capability for longer AI-generated clips. While some users praised Grok's technical advancements and its conversational features, others raised ethical concerns regarding the use of celebrity likenesses without consent. The clip also reignited broader debates about deepfake technology, including the potential for misuse and the challenge of distinguishing AI-generated content from reality. Musk framed the video as a product update, coinciding with a recent X platform outage, signaling that development on Grok continues despite technical setbacks.

This policy shift is driven by a broader push toward digital sovereignty and reducing dependence on U.S.-based technology services amid growing concerns in Europe over data security and reliance on foreign providers. A spokesperson from the Interministerial Digital Authority (Dinum) confirmed to POLITICO that a formal notice is being prepared and will be published in the coming days. The notice will require state officials to switch to Visio, a home-grown videoconferencing solution developed by Dinum and hosted on infrastructure from the French company Outscale. This follows an announcement by Minister for State Reform David Amiel, who stated that France aims to fully adopt the domestic platform across government by 2027.

Milk prices have fallen to around $14 per hundredweight, a level considered unsustainable for family-run operations. The farmer questions whether government policies, tariffs, bureaucratic processes, or large dairy cooperatives are partly to blame for the financial strain. They also express disappointment in political leaders, including former President Trump, whom they previously supported, for not addressing the hardships faced by dairy farmers. The post contrasts personal struggles with the broader political discourse, noting that some shared political content from pro-Trump pages clashes with the realities of farming life. Agricultural economists emphasize that milk prices are influenced by multiple factors, including production levels, feed costs, export demand, and cooperative pricing structures.

German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil proposed forming a core group of six leading EU economies—including France, Poland, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands—to coordinate key policies aimed at strengthening Europe's sovereignty, resilience, and competitiveness. The initiative comes as EU nations seek to reduce reliance on imported critical raw materials, especially from China, and address potential risks from global trade fragmentation. The German and French finance ministers emphasize advancing the capital markets union, reinforcing the euro as a stable international currency, improving defense cooperation, and securing strategic resources like rare earth minerals.

This figure exceeds the 760-762 cases from the 2025 West Texas outbreak, which originated in an under-vaccinated Mennonite community and resulted in two child deaths, making the current South Carolina outbreak the largest in the United States in nearly three decades. The epicenter remains Spartanburg County, where the virus initially spread in October 2025 through elementary and middle schools, many private Christian academies with largely unvaccinated student populations. Holiday gatherings and travel further accelerated community transmission. Most cases (695) involve unvaccinated individuals, with 14 partially vaccinated, 20 fully vaccinated, and 60 of unknown status. The majority affect children: 493 cases in ages 5-17 and 203 in those under 5, with only 65 in adults over 18.

In company-wide Slack channels, workers voiced ethical concerns, with one stating they viewed ICE as 'the bad guys' and felt ashamed of the association. They questioned the extent of Palantir's involvement in immigration enforcement, including whether the company could influence ICE practices or if its tools might contribute to improper targeting, such as detaining asylum seekers without criminal records. In response, Palantir's privacy and civil liberties team updated an internal wiki to outline its work, including a $30 million contract for the ImmigrationOS platform launched in April 2025.

Dope, once trapped in a severe addiction to pasta base—a drug devastating Santiago's peripheral neighborhoods—transformed his life through political hip-hop workshops, education popular, and community organizing. He became an exemplary figure of resilience, solidarity, and commitment to mutual aid, inspiring the author deeply and symbolizing hope against neoliberal destruction. Dope conducted powerful workshops, shared his story publicly to help youth escape addiction, and collaborated in music that linked personal struggle to collective resistance. Though contact faded over time due to distance, Dope remained a talisman of possibility for the author. In 2022, news arrived that Dope had relapsed amid depression, ending up homeless in a makeshift shelter while still reciprocating c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tribute-to-el-loko-dope-hip-hop-activist-from-san-bernardo-murdered-in-brutal-attack</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tribute-to-el-loko-dope-hip-hop-activist-from-san-bernardo-murdered-in-brutal-attack</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Review: Staying at London Hilton on Park Lane with Suite Upgrade and Lounge Access Using Hilton Free Night Certificates]]></title><description><![CDATA[The review details a stay at the London Hilton on Park Lane over New Year's Eve using four Hilton free night certificates.

One room was upgraded to a spacious Deluxe Park Lane Suite featuring a large living room, dining area, balcony with views, king bedroom, walk-in closet, and a bathroom with shower and tub. The only minor issue was an opaque window between bedroom and bathroom causing light disturbance. The executive lounge, accessible via the wife's Diamond status for both rooms, offered a solid breakfast and an impressive evening canapes and drinks spread, extended until 10pm on New Year's Eve with free-flowing sparkling wine. The location on Park Lane is excellent, opposite Hyde Park and near Buckingham Palace, with good tube access.

Since the war began in 2022, Germany has been a major arms supplier to Ukraine, second only to the United States, spending nearly €20 billion on military aid up to October last year. The Defense Minister explained that German military production has reached its limits and that over a third of Germany's Patriot systems have already been delivered to Ukraine. Berlin must now focus on replacing the systems it has supplied and modernizing training and maintenance for its own forces. Data from the German Ministry of Economy shows a sharp drop in arms exports to Ukraine, from €8.15 billion the previous year to just €1.14 billion last year. Despite this, Germany plans to continue supporting Ukraine with an allocated €11.5 billion this year, targeting artillery, drones, armored vehicles, and potentially two more Patriot systems, though it is uncle]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-halts-further-delivery-of-patriot-air-defense-systems-to-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-halts-further-delivery-of-patriot-air-defense-systems-to-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 07:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zimbabwe Accelerates Diplomatic Efforts to Join BRICS Bloc]]></title><description><![CDATA[Zimbabwe is actively pursuing full membership in the BRICS group, viewing it as a key strategy to accelerate economic development and overcome international isolation.

The earlier incident occurred when Pretti stopped his car to observe and protest ICE agents chasing a family; he began whistling and yelling, leading five agents to tackle him, with one leaning on his back and causing the injury. Medication records reviewed by CNN were consistent with treatment for a broken rib. Sources indicated federal agents were aware of Pretti's name, potentially from a DHS surveillance database collecting information on Minneapolis protesters, amid a broader immigration enforcement surge. This raises questions about recognition during the fatal encounter. Pretti's death was the second killing of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis that month, following Renée Nicole Good's shooting.

Photos and video from the event showed the muzzle of her rifle tilting toward the head and face of an agent standing to her left, an action known as 'muzzle sweep.' This violates a fundamental firearms safety rule: always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction and never point a gun at anything you do not intend to destroy. Wyoming firearms experts, including retired peace officer and trainer Frank Groth and NRA-certified instructor Vince Vanata, emphasized the importance of muzzle awareness and treating every firearm as if it is loaded. They noted that even if the weapon was likely unloaded for the photo op, the breach in protocol was concerning, as an accidental discharge could cause injury from muzzle blast or other hazards.

The incident occurred amid federal immigration enforcement operations in the area. According to the report, CBP personnel ordered two female civilians to move out of a roadway during enforcement actions; when they refused, an officer pushed them, prompting one woman to run to Pretti for help. Agents then attempted to move Pretti and the woman, deploying oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray when they did not comply. Efforts to take Pretti into custody led to resistance and a physical struggle. During the altercation, a Border Patrol Agent (BPA) shouted 'He's got a gun!' multiple times. Approximately five seconds later, one BPA fired his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP Officer (CBPO) fired his Glock 47 at Pretti.

Fico, usually a strong supporter of Trump, reportedly described the president as 'dangerous' and 'out of his mind' according to multiple European diplomats. The details of the conversation that triggered Fico's reaction were not disclosed. However, publicly, Fico praised the meeting on Facebook, highlighting discussions on Ukraine, U.S.-Slovakia relations, and the EU's challenges, and did not mention Greenland or other controversial topics raised by Trump earlier in January. Fico later denied POLITICO's report, calling it false, and reaffirmed his support for many of Trump's strategies.

The incident occurred amid protests related to federal immigration enforcement operations in the city. Videos and witness accounts indicate Pretti was holding a phone while recording or observing the scene, not brandishing his licensed firearm, when agents approached, subdued him, and fired multiple shots. Federal officials initially described it as defensive action against a perceived threat, but investigations revealed protocol issues, leading to agents being placed on leave and an ongoing review. Stephen Miller acknowledged potential deviations from procedure, and President Trump promised an honest investigation. Pretti's family described him as kind and generous, devastated by the loss.

Under the proposed Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA), foreign companies investing in key strategic sectors of the EU would be required to form partnerships with European firms. These joint ventures would include mandatory sharing of know-how, a limit of 49% on foreign ownership, and a requirement to source half of manufacturing within the EU. The policy aims to raise industrial production from 14.3% of EU gross added value in 2020 to at least 20% by 2030. Critics argue that the move contradicts Europe’s long-standing commitment to open markets and could face legal and political challenges, including resistance from member states such as Sweden.

Before departing the White House for a trip to Iowa on Tuesday, Trump spoke briefly with reporters about the incident and was asked to respond to public concern. He described the situation as very sad, stressing that he felt compassion for Pretti’s family and referring broadly to his affection for “all of our people.” 

When addressing the circumstances around the shooting, Trump emphasized that individuals “can’t have guns” and “can’t walk in with guns,” suggesting that carrying firearms into certain situations is unacceptable. His remarks prompted a reporter to challenge him by invoking the Second Amendment, which protects the right to keep and bear arms in the United States. Rather than directly engaging with the constitutional question, Trump repeated his point that people cannot walk in with guns and that such actions are not permitted.

The service ensures rebookings stay within the same fare product, such as not switching from Economy to Basic Economy, though the specific fare class may change. It charges 25% of the savings under the 'Pay Per Win' plan with no upfront fee, or offers a Pro tier for $9.99/month that lowers the fee to 15% and adds monitoring for award reservations (notifying users of price drops for manual rebooking).

Glass announced his decision on January 27, stating on social media that after careful consideration, he felt compelled to pull the piece because the symphony portrays Abraham Lincoln and embodies values that are now in direct conflict with those of the Kennedy Center under its current leadership. This leadership change stems from President Donald Trump's takeover of the institution, including his appointment as chairman, board restructuring with allies, and the renaming of the venue to incorporate his name as the Trump-Kennedy Center in late 2025.

The 1986 International Court of Justice ruling against the U.S. in the Nicaragua case confirmed that interfering with peaceful maritime trade is illegal. The U.S. has circumvented international law through domestic legislation, such as the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 and its later extensions, to impose unilateral sanctions without formal war declarations. The embargo against Cuba, in place since 1962, has caused severe humanitarian consequences, including widespread malnutrition and limited access to medical care.

Africa has become a primary focus, with a significant surge in investments and construction contracts. The strategy has shifted to productive sectors rather than broad infrastructure lending. Energy projects, including renewables like solar, wind, and hydro, as well as oil and gas, play a central role in addressing Africa's energy demands and strengthening Chinese market presence.

Poch emphasizes the ideological role of the entertainment industry, especially Hollywood and British cinema, in romanticizing colonial violence and transforming historical atrocities into heroic narratives. Films depicting imperial expansion in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are presented as cultural tools that normalize domination and obscure mass suffering, such as famines, forced labor, and racial hierarchies.

Key points include its expiration, notably on December 31 each year when unused Bilt Cash is lost (referred to as 'Bilt Cash Gets Trashed Day'), though some carryover may be allowed up to a limit like $100. Usage is restricted and functions more like coupons or discounts within the Bilt ecosystem rather than flexible cash equivalents, such as unlocking additional points on housing payments (e.g., using Bilt Cash to convert to points at ratios like $30 for 1,000 points on rent/]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frequent-miler-podcast-analyzes-bilt-cash-rewards-currency-and-its-limitations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frequent-miler-podcast-analyzes-bilt-cash-rewards-currency-and-its-limitations</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ice agent tries to enter Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis]]></title><description><![CDATA[The video shows an ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agent attempting to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis.

On Saturday, US President Donald Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on Canadian imports if Canada signs a trade agreement with China. Trump criticized Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, suggesting that Canada should not serve as a gateway for Chinese goods entering the US. Trump warned that China would 'devour Canada,' claiming it could destroy its economy and way of life. The announcement follows Canada’s recent agreements with China on reciprocal tariffs and the import of 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles under preferential tariffs of 6.1%. These agreements mark a significant step in strengthening China-Canada relations, which have been tense since 2018 due to the Huawei executive's arrest in Canada and subsequent detention of Canadian citizens in China. Despite Trump's threats, much of Canada-US trade remains tariff-free under NAFTA.

This announcement comes in response to former President Donald Trump's recent declaration of a U.S. naval deployment to the Middle East, which is intended to pressure Iran. The UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that protecting its land, airspace, and maritime borders is a top priority and that any use of its territory for offensive operations against another sovereign nation would be unacceptable. The UAE's refusal directly affects U.S. strategic and logistical planning, limiting potential positions for naval operations and supply routes. The statement highlights the vigilance of Gulf countries regarding regional diplomacy and underscores the UAE’s neutral stance in the potential U.S.-Iran conflict.

Two U.S. citizen employees of Target were briefly detained, sparking outrage and strikes among workers. Churches urged companies to take a stand, leading to discussions about restricting ICE police presence in commercial areas. Earlier in January, Hilton Hotels faced pressure after refusing ICE reservations, and the Department of Homeland Security accused the chain of siding with criminals.

According to an official online bulletin, affected systems may fail to start and instead display a black screen accompanied by the stop code “UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME,” leaving users unable to complete the startup process without manual intervention.

The issue appears to primarily affect physical machines running Windows 11 versions 24H2 and 25H2. While Microsoft states that only a small number of reports have been received, the severity of the problem has raised concern, as impacted devices require recovery through the Windows Recovery Environment and the removal of the latest security update to restore functionality.

His demotion follows the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by agents under his command in Minneapolis. The incident has prompted the Trump administration to reconsider its aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, signaling a potential shift away from the nationwide mass-deportation campaign. President Trump indicated alignment with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and assigned former ICE chief Tom Homan to oversee federal operations in Minnesota.

Video footage circulating online shows the woman lying face-down in the snow following the attack, and later being escorted away with visible facial injuries and significant bleeding.

According to reports, a ski instructor intervened by waving his ski poles, successfully driving the snow leopard away and preventing further harm.

Unlike previous missions such as the Voyagers, which relied on radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), these probes will employ 1-kilowatt fission nuclear reactors using uranium-molybdenum alloy fuel, sodium coolant, and thermoelectric conversion with silicon-germanium alloys. This design ensures long-term power for over 30 years and allows safe launch in a shutdown state to prevent radioactive release in accidents. Each probe has a maximum mass of 8.2 tons, enabling launch aboard Long March 5 rockets, making this the second dual Long March 5 mission after Tianwen-3. The probe targeting the heliosheath's tail will launch in April 2032, perform a Jupiter flyby, and reach the tail region in 2059 at 130 AU (about 19.5 billion kilometers).

Driving a car offers maximum flexibility and allows travelers to explore remote areas at their own pace, though it can be slow and tiring. Air travel is the fastest option, especially for covering long distances like Sydney to Perth, but it can be costly and offers less freedom to explore remote regions. Coaches, such as Greyhound buses, are the most economical choice and can be convenient for overnight travel, but they are slower and less comfortable. Trains provide the highest comfort with spacious seating and amenities like sleeper cabins and dining cars, though service frequency is limited and travel times can still be lengthy.

The author highlights examples such as the Iraq war, the Syrian civil conflict fueled by Operation Timber Sycamore, the repeated Israeli interventions in Lebanon, the Libyan civil war after NATO intervention, and regional destabilization in Somalia and Sudan. The article claims that Israeli influence motivated U.S. military actions and sanctions that led to the collapse of local states, millions of deaths, and widespread human suffering. It concludes that the broader Middle East has been destabilized to secure Israeli strategic priorities, noting that economic sanction]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-regional-military-influence-and-its-global-consequences</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israel-s-regional-military-influence-and-its-global-consequences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marvel Comics Artist Sal Buscema, Co-Creator of Rom and The Defenders, Dies at 89]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sal Buscema, renowned comic book artist and co-creator of several Marvel characters and titles, passed away at the age of 89, just before what would have been his 90th birthday. Born Silvio Buscema in Brooklyn, New York, in 1936, he began his career in the 1950s by inking his older brother John Buscema's work. He later joined Marvel Comics full-time in 1968 and quickly became known for his speed and reliability, earning the nickname 'Our Pal Sal'. Over his long career, Sal worked on major titles including The Incredible Hulk, The Spectacular Spider-Man, New Mutants, Captain America, Rom: Spaceknight, The Avengers, and The Defenders. He often inked his own work and co-created characters such as Lady Deathstrike, Jean DeWolff, Starhawk, and the Time Variance Authority.

Parsi argues that while a broad plan exists in the recently released National Security Strategy—which explicitly rejects prior U.S. global dominance ambitions and calls for more aggressive action in the Western Hemisphere—significant gaps appear in its practical application. Examples include military moves in Venezuela and the pursuit of control over Greenland. Despite the strategy downplaying U.S. interest in the Middle East, risks of a major war with Iran have escalated. Parsi believes a decision to strike Iran was reached in late December following Netanyahu's U.S. visit, with Iranian protests causing only a temporary delay. He anticipates not a limited operation but a stronger attack aimed at regime decapitation, followed by efforts to install an internal successor rather than chaos-inducing regime change like in Ira]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-trump-s-foreign-policy-contradictions-interview-with-trita-parsi-on-potential-actions-in-iran-venezuela-and-greenland</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-trump-s-foreign-policy-contradictions-interview-with-trita-parsi-on-potential-actions-in-iran-venezuela-and-greenland</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 18:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bilt Announces February 1 Promotions: Accor Transfer Bonus and Rent Giveaway]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bilt has announced its next Rent Day promotions for February 1, 2026, offering multiple opportunities for Bilt members to maximize rewards.

In 2025, cryptocurrency transactions in the country reached an estimated 7.8 billion USD—a record increase driven by growing public demand during times of crisis. Ordinary Iranians have been purchasing Bitcoin and other digital assets at a faster rate as inflation approaches 50% and the Iranian rial has lost nearly 90% of its value since 2022. For many, cryptocurrencies function as a means to protect their savings from rapid devaluation and economic instability.

However, this trend extends beyond the population. Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps reportedly uses cryptocurrencies as a tool to bypass Western financial restrictions, having accumulated around 3 billion USD in digital assets last year. This figure likely underestimates real holdings, as it only includes blockchain addresses identified by U.S. and Israeli financial authorities.

Guerriau, who resigned from the Senate in October 2025, denies any intent to commit sexual assault, claiming the drink was served accidentally.

In the recording, Pretti honors the veteran’s service with words of gratitude and respect, underscoring his commitment to caring for those who served the country.

Friends and neighbors recall Pretti as a quiet, warmhearted person who consistently showed kindness to others.

The facility, also known as Camp East Montana, currently houses over 2,700 people, making it the largest immigration detention center in the United States. Sworn declarations from detainees describe officers crushing testicles, slamming heads into walls, sexual assault, verbal humiliation, and denying access to medical care and lawyers. One teenager, identified as 'Samuel,' described being beaten unconscious, having his tooth broken, and suffering severe testicular and ear injuries. Another detainee, 'Isaac,' reported similar sexual abuse and threats of forced deportation to countries they had no ties to.

The soldiers are among five members of an Israeli military unit charged with aggravated assault following an incident at the Sde Teiman detention camp in July 2024. A leaked video from the incident shows soldiers beating a Palestinian prisoner and later gang-raping him behind riot shields. The detainee was hospitalized with severe internal injuries and long-term trauma.

The court hearing did not focus on the alleged assault itself, but rather on a dispute over who should lead the investigation into the leak of the video footage. The leak sparked a major political and institutional scandal in Israel, ultimately leading to the resignation and arrest of the army’s former chief legal adviser, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi.

Lilly explained that her recovery has required significant financial resources, as she pursued expert assessments and customized care tailored specifically to her condition.

However, widely shared video footage appears to contradict that claim, showing that he had been disarmed and restrained when federal agents fired multiple shots.

The killing has reignited debate over the conduct, training, and oversight of federal immigration enforcement.

For over a thousand years, it operated as an autonomous monastic republic with its own laws, recognized historically by Byzantine emperors, Ottoman sultans, Greek kings, and even the European Union. A rule called 'avaton', established in 1046, prohibited the entry of women to preserve the monks’ spiritual focus. Female animals were also banned to prevent distractions, although some, like cats and hens, were allowed for practical reasons. Interestingly, Catalans were historically banned due to a violent conflict in 1305 known as the 'Catalan Revenge'. Following the assassination of Roger de Flor and the massacre of Catalan mercenaries, the survivors retaliated brutally against the Byzantine Empire, including looting monasteries on Mount Athos. As a result, Catalans were collectively prohibited from entering the peninsula for centuries.

The process is described as both therapeutic and ceremonious, allowing drink makers to engage with the ingredients and enhance the overall hospitality experience. By manually breaking down ice, the surface area increases, which not only improves the drink's texture but also its flavor and social appeal.

Estimated at around four trillion euros and unfolding over the current and next decade, this transfer is described as one of the largest movements of private wealth in Spain’s recent history. Spanish banks view the process as a major business opportunity, competing aggressively to attract the new profile of the ‘millennial heir’: digitally savvy, suddenly wealthy, and potentially loyal to new financial products.

Beyond its immediate financial implications, the article stresses the broader economic and social risks associated with this phenomenon.

Originally, the Gemini program was a NASA initiative, conceived as Mercury Mark II, to develop orbital docking and extravehicular activities before the Apollo missions. While NASA considered Gemini as a preparatory step toward Apollo, the military saw it as an opportunity to explore space operations for potential orbital stations. In 1962, the Blue Gemini program was launched to support MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), a planned military space station, which later evolved into the MOL (Manned Orbital Laboratory) featuring reconnaissance capabilities including the KH-10 DORIAN telescope. The program planned multiple missions, initially including both NASA and Air Force astronauts, with tasks such as docking with Agena targets, testing the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit, reconnaissance, and deployment of equipment.

The legislation, co-sponsored by Boebert and Republican Jeff Hurd alongside two Democratic senators, aimed to extend loan repayment deadlines for Colorado towns building a crucial water pipeline. The bill had passed unanimously in both chambers of Congress. Trump vetoed it, arguing that it would extend federal taxpayer responsibility for local costs and perpetuate inefficient policies. Boebert condemned the veto as a betrayal of constituents’ needs, noting that it denied clean drinking water to thousands of Coloradans who had supported the president in all three of his elections. She added that she hoped the decision was not political retaliation for her support of a measure demanding the release of the Epstein files.

X+Living’s design emphasizes red brick, using it as the core material for the facade, spiral staircase, book 'rooms,' arches, and circulation elements. Approximately 400,000 custom bricks were hand-cut to create a seamless and immersive experience that feels rooted in the neighborhood while maintaining a futuristic, almost science-fiction aesthetic. In the central space, dark blue steel elements contrast with the brick, inspired by blinds to open sightlines and prevent the masonry from feeling too heavy. Furniture such as shelving, benches, and seating is built as an extension of the architecture, ensuring cohesive visual continuity and avoiding typical retail clutter.

Johnson, 44, allegedly abused a victim over several months beginning in 2024 in Hernando County. Court filings indicate that he attempted to silence the victim by offering a financial payout and referencing his Trump pardon, claiming he would include the victim in his will. Previously, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges related to the Capitol riot, including breaking into a Senate meeting room and menacing police, and was sentenced to one year in prison in August 2024, a sentence later wiped out by the pardon. He was arrested in July 2025 and remains in custody ahead of his trial scheduled for February 9, 2026. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

She reports that these judicial processes aim to demoralize and financially exhaust activists, forcing many to abandon their movements due to stress, legal costs, and fear of criminal records that can jeopardize visas, scholarships, or jobs. According to Gari, accusations of 'assaulting police' frequently target those who were in fact victims of police violence, while acts such as chanting banned slogans, wearing Palestinian symbols, or even defending oneself during arrests are treated as criminal offenses.

The new U.S. national defense policy, presented by the Pentagon, signals a shift in how the country relates to its traditional allies, pressing them to take on greater responsibility for their own defense. This adjustment comes as the U.S. faces internal challenges and a new global balance of power that limits its capacity to act as the world’s primary security guarantor. 

In practice, this strategy involves cuts to certain aid programs, relocating military bases, adjusting joint exercises, and tightening budgets.

She also underscored the importance of First and Fourth Amendment rights, particularly the rights to protest peacefully and record public events.

In her comments posted on X, Greene urged supporters of former President Donald Trump to imagine how they might respond if similar events occurred under a Democratic administration.

Karpathy cautions that while demos may impress, turning them into safe, scalable products takes years due to the immense complexity and high cost of failure.

Following escalations in U.S.-Canada trade disputes, including tariff threats on Canadian goods like aluminum, lumber, and agriculture, combined with provocative political statements—such as suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state—many Canadians have chosen to avoid travel to Florida and other U.S. destinations. This shift has led to a reported loss of around 280,000 tourism-related jobs in Florida, encompassing roles in hospitality, restaurants, real estate, and support services, with some estimates suggesting the figure could be higher when including indirect impacts.

Traditionally, self-reported happiness follows a U-shaped curve, with higher levels in youth and older age and a dip in middle adulthood. However, newer data shows that young people's flourishing scores now start low due to rising mood disorders and remain depressed until middle age, altering the classic pattern. This trend is global but more pronounced in affluent, secular societies. Key factors include declining religious attendance, which boosts flourishing measures by about 8% on average worldwide and even more in rich countries, and a corresponding loss of meaning and purpose—ironically, higher GDP per capita correlates with weaker senses of life's worthwhileness.

Curated by Connie Hüsser, the exhibition brings together the work of more than 75 designers who were invited to rethink the concept of home on a miniature scale. Rather than functioning purely as shelters for birds, the resulting designs act as small but powerful reflections on architecture, identity, and emotional attachment to place.

The birdhouses vary widely in style and intention. Some resemble traditional cabins or modernist dwellings, while others embrace fantasy, humor, fragility, or nostalgia. This diversity underscores the exhibition’s central idea: that home is not defined by a single form, aesthetic, or size, but by feeling, care, and imagination.

This move, which primarily affects countries like Romania, is portrayed as a major shift marking the decline of transatlantic solidarity that began in 1945. Romania, one of the first countries impacted, has confirmed the withdrawal of a substantial portion of the U.S. contingent stationed on its territory. The report situates this move within a broader pattern of U.S. military restructuring in both Africa and Europe. The withdrawal affects NATO deployments that were reinforced after 2014, following the political crisis in Ukraine, when the alliance expanded its presence along Russia’s borders.

The tanker, reportedly operating under multiple names—'Grinch' on the UK’s sanction list and 'Carl' on those of the EU and the U.S.—was seized and taken to the port of Marseille. The publication argues that France’s justification, claiming the ship was under international sanctions and sailing under a false flag, is misleading, contending that such unilateral sanctions contradict international law. It describes the seizure as an act of piracy and points out that ship reflagging is a common maritime practice used for reasons like tax advantages, labor regulations, and port access, not concealment.

The article also situates this case within a broader Western campaign against so-called 'ghost fleets'—shipping networks allegedly used by Russia and Iran to bypass economic sanctions and cont]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-intercepts-russian-oil-tanker-in-alboran-sea-amid-sanctions-dispute</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-intercepts-russian-oil-tanker-in-alboran-sea-amid-sanctions-dispute</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peter Pichler Architecture Designs Timber-Clad Mountain Stations and Alpine Hut in Ponte di Legno, Italy]]></title><description><![CDATA[In the Italian Alps near Ponte di Legno, Peter Pichler Architecture has designed a series of new mountain stations and an alpine hut for the Valbione gondola route. These structures replace older ski lifts, providing a smoother and more integrated ascent through the historic alpine landscape. The design draws inspiration from traditional alpine huts, featuring steep gabled roofs, timber construction, and minimalist forms that blend seamlessly with the surrounding terrain without dominating it. The buildings emphasize restraint, precision, and calm aesthetics, avoiding flashy elements in favor of a thoughtful, understated presence. Interiors are warm and light-filled, dominated by wood that conveys craftsmanship, comfort, and a timeless quality, softening the rugged mountain environment. The stations serve as intentional stops along the new gondola line, while the summit alpine hut functions as a sheltered space for visitors to linger, offering panoramic connections to the peaks while r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/peter-pichler-architecture-designs-timber-clad-mountain-stations-and-alpine-hut-in-ponte-di-legno-italy</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/peter-pichler-architecture-designs-timber-clad-mountain-stations-and-alpine-hut-in-ponte-di-legno-italy</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dutch Parliament Moves Toward Annual Capital Gains Tax by 2028]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Dutch government is preparing to overhaul its wealth tax system, with plans to begin taxing capital gains annually by 2028. A parliamentary majority appears ready to support the proposal, although many lawmakers criticize its complexity and potential impact on investors. The reform targets the so-called Box 3 asset tax, which had been based on assumed returns rather than actual investment performance — a system the courts ruled unfair. Under the new model, investors would pay tax on both realized and unrealized gains, meaning profits from stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies would be taxed even before assets are sold. This approach has sparked concern across the political spectrum, as many parties consider it unreasonable to tax theoretical, non-liquid earnings. Still, caretaker State Secretary for Taxation Eugène Heijnen argued that taxing only realized gains is not feasible before 2028 and delaying further would cost the treasury about €2.3 billion per year. Although the plan is re]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dutch-parliament-moves-toward-annual-capital-gains-tax-by-2028</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/dutch-parliament-moves-toward-annual-capital-gains-tax-by-2028</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok creator Mackenzie Paul passes away at 26 after battling acute myeloid leukemia]]></title><description><![CDATA[TikTok personality Mackenzie Paul has died at the age of 26 following a prolonged struggle with acute myeloid leukemia.

The study area, located in the Iberian Range of Aragón, provides one of the longest and most detailed regional hydroclimatic records for the western Mediterranean. The authors developed a robust tree-ring chronology and correlated it with high-resolution precipitation datasets, achieving a strong relationship between annual ring growth and rainfall over a 320-day window from August to June. Their reconstruction shows substantial long-term variation in precipitation patterns since 1505 CE and, notably, a distinct intensification of both droughts and wet extremes since the late twentieth century.

These demands include providing the Department of Justice with the state's voter registration records, repealing sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and sharing records related to Medicaid and Food and Nutrition Service programs. Bondi justified the request by citing a claimed 1,300 percent increase in violence against ICE officers and a 3,200 percent rise in vehicular attacks on federal agents, attributing the unrest to rhetoric from Minnesota officials, including Walz's description of federal agents as 'Trump's modern-day Gestapo' and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's strong anti-ICE statements.

The order came after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit earlier on the same day against the Trump administration, seeking to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

Vance during donor meetings. According to the tapes, Cruz expressed frustration over Trump’s tariff strategy, warning that it could badly damage the U.S. economy by reducing 401(k) values and raising prices. He told donors that he and several senators held a heated call with Trump after the tariffs were announced, describing the exchange as angry and unproductive. Trump allegedly responded to Cruz’s warnings with profanity. Cruz also mocked Trump’s labeling of the tariffs as “Liberation Day” and admitted he banned the term within his team.

However, this dynamic has shifted as war becomes a profitable business. A key example presented is Elon Musk’s company SpaceX, which has entered into deep cooperation with U.S. military and intelligence agencies. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2021 SpaceX signed a secret $1.8 billion contract with the U.S. government, representing a major portion of its total revenue.

The naval strike group is also supported by EA-18 Growler electronic warfare aircraft designed to neutralize enemy air defenses. Complementing this, the U.S. Air Force has deployed F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft, and F-15E Strike Eagles being sent toward Jordan.

However, many municipal boundaries are highly irregular due to historical processes such as the Reconquista, property-based divisions in the 19th century, annexations, secessions, and border disputes. The article highlights several notable examples of absurd municipal shapes across the country. San Sebastián has three exclaves in Gipuzkoa, including Zubieta (shared with Usúrbil), Landarbaso, and Urdaburu, resulting from historical separations and old mountain delineations. Guadalajara includes a large exclave at Usanos and a distant oak forest area. Noreña in Asturias consists of five separate enclaves entirely within Siero, stemming from 19th-century land ownership patterns.

Experts, including Professor Helen Roy from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and the University of Exeter, attribute this boom to several favourable conditions. A mild winter allowed many ladybirds to emerge successfully from hibernation, followed by a dry spring that produced high numbers of aphids—the primary food source for many ladybird species. Subsequent warm, humid summer weather and heatwaves enabled the new generation to thrive, complete their life cycles quickly, and multiply rapidly. While some sightings involve the invasive harlequin ladybird, which tends to cluster in large groups indoors or on structures, most are harmless native species like the seven-spot ladybird.

The incident occurred amid Operation Metro Surge, part of broader immigration enforcement efforts in the second Trump administration, and marked the third shooting by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within a short period, following the deaths of Renée Good and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis.

On January 24, 2026, Border Patrol agents shot and killed Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at a VA hospital, during an encounter amid immigration enforcement operations and related protests. Official statements from the Department of Homeland Security indicated that Pretti approached agents armed with a gun, though this has been disputed by family and witnesses. Rittenhouse shared an Instagram story about 'liberating Minneapolis' and posted a 'how to stay alive' tip advising against pulling guns on federal agents. He also shared an AI-generated image depicting himself armed in what appeared to be Minneapolis.

The event became a turning point that strained relations between both governments. Washington allegedly challenged South Africa’s internal governance and refused to recognize the country’s transfer of the G20 presidency as legitimate. Following these tensions, Trump reportedly decided that the U.S. would push for South Africa’s removal from the group in 2026. In response, South Africa announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos that it would voluntarily withdraw from participating this year rather than risk official exclusion. According to Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, the United States effectively controlled delegation accreditation, which restricted South Africa’s representation at G20 meetings. Pretoria framed its withdrawal as a dignified, sovereign decision rather than a concession, preserving its internatio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-between-the-u-s-and-south-africa-lead-to-withdrawal-from-the-g20</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tensions-between-the-u-s-and-south-africa-lead-to-withdrawal-from-the-g20</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Border Patrol shooting in Minneapolis leaves one man injured, investigation underway]]></title><description><![CDATA[A shooting occurred outside Glam Doll Donuts on Nicollet Avenue South in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, around 9 a.m. local time. According to multiple local news outlets, Border Patrol agents were involved in the incident, during which a man was reportedly shot following a physical struggle. Video footage from the scene showed several agents and first responders performing chest compressions on the wounded man, who appeared unconscious. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Border Patrol have yet to release an official statement explaining why shots were fired. Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reported that the man was 'down' as medics attempted to revive him, and later sources within DHS confirmed that the suspect was armed and that a firearm had been recovered at the scene.

The initiative, developed in partnership with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt, aims to improve the financial stability and health outcomes of working-class Arizonans burdened by healthcare costs. According to the governor, reducing medical debt is a vital step toward fulfilling what she calls the “Arizona Promise,” a vision of economic opportunity and dignity for all residents. 

This debt relief effort forms part of a larger $2 billion statewide program designed to cancel medical debt using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds. These funds enable the state to purchase outstanding medical debt from hospitals and collection agencies for a fraction of its face value, then forgive the balance without requiring individuals to apply.

It highlights economic monopolization, particularly how three companies dominate agriculture and food distribution, stifling competition and turning daily life into profit opportunities for capital. Wages have stagnated despite rising productivity, forcing 8.4 million Americans into multiple jobs to survive, while employees at giants like Walmart and Amazon often rely on government food assistance. The piece traces the erosion of social safety nets to the Reagan era in the 1980s, including cuts to unemployment benefits, Social Security, and public education investment—such as introducing tuition fees at the previously free University of California system.

The DHS stated that the man was armed and resisting arrest during a scuffle, though details remain unclear about the exact sequence of events and whether he was actively holding a weapon at the moment he was shot. The shooting sparked immediate protests, with crowds scattering as agents used tear gas.

Protesters highlighted that around 2,000 individuals have been deported through the airport and that even airport workers have been detained by immigration agents. 

Roughly 100 clergy members joined the demonstration, singing, praying, and sharing personal stories of those affected by detention.

The sound of seagulls, the scent of fresh herring, and the warmth of winter wood stoves illustrate how deeply connected locals are to nature’s cycles. The author highlights the experience of traveling by train, where the Norwegian countryside unfolds from rugged mountains to tranquil fjords, reinforcing the idea of slow, mindful travel.

The piece highlights how the city’s layers of history manifest where centuries-old churches stand beside sleek museums, shaping the capital’s unique skyline. 

The journey then moves north by train, showcasing Portugal’s scenic interior filled with vineyards, olive groves, and flowing rivers. In Porto, the Douro River divides a vibrant landscape where baroque churches and former wine lodges coexist with today’s lively cultural scene.

The report claims that this strategy resembles efforts previously seen in Venezuela and includes economic pressure tactics such as blocking shipments of Venezuelan oil to Cuba. The alleged objective is to weaken Cuba’s energy supply and accelerate a government collapse from within.

The article portrays the endeavor as part of what it calls a new 'destabilization manual'—a plan for a rapid and controlled political transition. It notes that no official U.S. documents confirm this strategy, implying that Washington is still studying its options.

It explains that Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States in exchange for $25 million in gold—equivalent to roughly $633 million today—creating what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands. The treaty also included a clause recognizing Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland. The piece then transitions to the history of Little Saint James, known as 'Epstein Island,' which Epstein purchased in 1998 through his company LSJ for a little over $10 million. The island, covering only a few hundred meters, became infamous as the main location for Epstein’s alleged crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors.

This targeted promotion stands out because it lacks the standard 'once-per-lifetime' language that typically restricts welcome bonuses to those who have never held the card before. As a result, even people who currently hold or have previously held the Business Gold card may qualify if they receive the offer. The public standard offer for this card is generally 100,000 points after meeting similar spend requirements, making this 125,000-point version notably better for those targeted.

A federal judge has attempted to restrain their actions, yet the Trump administration has declared 'absolute immunity' for ICE agents and has opened criminal probes into Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’s mayor for obstructing federal enforcement.

It highlights that, despite public claims of halting arms exports in mid‑2025, Germany continued to authorize and deliver military materials and technology used in the war, including tank components, submarines, and small arms. The report reveals that legal distinctions in German export law—between war weapons and military goods, or between defensive and offensive equipment—allowed the Merz government to maintain exports while appearing to impose restrictions.

Agents removed them from a parked car; the family’s attorney claims agents smashed the car windows in the driveway and prevented the father from handing the child to her mother, who was inside the home with other family members. Both have active asylum claims and no final removal orders. Within hours, the pair was transferred to Texas via commercial flight at 8:30 p.m. The family's attorney, Kira Kelley, filed an emergency petition for release around 5:37 p.m. and a motion to halt the transfer shortly after.

According to Forbes, Microsoft receives an average of 20 requests per year for such recovery keys and sometimes complies.

The article begins with a real-life example of expediting a new Chase Marriott Bonvoy Boundless card delivery for free via overnight shipping, allowing immediate use for a hotel stay and bonus progress despite a holiday delay. It highlights differences among issuers: Chase and Amex often expedite for free (though Amex has been inconsistent lately), while Barclays and Capital One may charge fees. The piece stresses asking issuers for faster delivery when needed for near-term spending.

Specifically, Abascal is accused of praising immigration raids conducted by U.S. authorities ('la migra'), viewing them as a model that could be replicated in Spain to deport large numbers of immigrants. The author frames U.S. anti-immigrant sentiment as rooted in fear among the Anglo-Saxon population of losing control of the state to a rapidly growing Hispanic demographic, which is unmatched by any other ethnic group in terms of population growth and cultural influence. In the southern half of the United States—territories claimed to have been violently taken from Mexico—the Spanish language is increasingly common, causing alarm among English speaker]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticism-of-santiago-abascal-s-support-for-u-s-immigration-policies-and-zionism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticism-of-santiago-abascal-s-support-for-u-s-immigration-policies-and-zionism</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lazerian’s 'Cathedral of Sound' Turns Donated Guitars into a Living Musical Sculpture in Manchester]]></title><description><![CDATA[The 'Cathedral of Sound' is a large-scale public art installation created by Liam Hopkins of Manchester’s creative studio Lazerian. It embodies the deep connection between the city and its musical heritage. Built from hundreds of donated guitars collected through a citywide Guitar Amnesty, the work transforms these instruments—some pristine, others worn or broken—into a striking wooden pavilion that resonates with the collective memory of Manchester’s music scene. The sculpture goes beyond symbolism: it actively produces sound. A wind-activated system plucks the embedded guitar strings, allowing the structure to play itself in response to changes in the weather. Thus, the artwork becomes a living instrument, performing an ever-shifting symphony of subtle tones. 

Visitors are encouraged to step inside the sculpture, surrounded by layers of history embedded in each guitar, from early lessons to forgotten gigs.

His images reveal rare moments that most people never witness clearly—a sweeping Milky Way stretching across the horizon and waves of aurora illuminating mountains and ancient forests. The photos were taken in remote areas including Crater Lake in Oregon, Mount Baker, and California’s Bristlecone pine forests. Each picture represents hours of preparation, patience, and technical precision. Working through long, cold nights, Johnson adjusts his camera settings in total darkness using long exposures to gather as much starlight as possible. The unpredictability of the aurora means constant adaptation to capture its brief, shifting patterns of light. Beyond their visual beauty, the photographs tell a story of endurance and dedication—of the quiet persistence required to wait for nature’s elusive displays.

K. had claimed 'combatant privilege,' arguing that his alleged actions were those of a Ukrainian soldier targeting enemy infrastructure amid war with Russia. The BGH ruled that this argument does not apply because the Nord Stream pipelines are considered civilian infrastructure and that covert operations without clear state affiliation, such as uniforms or formal orders, are excluded from combatant immunity under international law. 

The court confirmed that Serhii K. will face prosecution in Germany for violating the country’s internal security and sovereignty. He may also be investigated for war crimes due to the civilian nature of the target. The ruling has revived debate over who orchestrated the attack — Ukraine, acting against Russian energy leverage, or Russia]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/german-court-denies-immunity-to-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/german-court-denies-immunity-to-ukrainian-suspect-in-nord-stream-sabotage-case</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Understanding Bilt Cash: How Bilt’s New Rewards System Actually Works]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explains the newly launched 'Bilt Cash' program, part of Bilt’s revamped credit card ecosystem referred to as Bilt 2.0. Bilt Cash introduces a separate rewards currency that cardholders earn at 4% on all non-housing purchases and an additional $50 in Bilt Cash for every 25,000 Bilt points accumulated in a calendar year. However, most Bilt Cash expires at the end of each year, with only $100 rolling over. The program lets users redeem Bilt Cash for 19 different 'coupon-like' benefits, ranging from point accelerators to small monthly credits for services such as Lyft, Grubhub, Walgreens, or hotel stays. These offers have varying restrictions, including usage limits, expiration dates, and membership tiers. The most valuable redemptions are considered the 1X points accelerator — which costs $200 Bilt Cash and applies to $5,000 in everyday spending — and the ability to unlock rewards on rent payments, where $30 in Bilt Cash allows users to earn points on $1,000 of rent.

Currently, Russia’s Rosatom controls 43% of the global uranium enrichment market, while the US imports over 70% of its enriched uranium despite abundant North American mining resources. The main challenge is in the conversion and enrichment stages. In response, Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced $2.7 billion in subsidies to three domestic projects, each awarded $900 million: American Centrifuge Operating and General Matter for high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), and French firm Orano for low-enriched uranium (LEU) at a new $5 billion facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, expected online by 2031. This builds on earlier efforts, including Urenco’s capacity expansion in New Mexico and the reopening of a US conversion plant.

The watchdog’s report, titled 'What Would a Fiscal Crisis Look Like?', cautions that unless policymakers implement a sustainable plan to reduce deficits, the country could face one or more severe economic breakdowns. The CRFB identifies six possible crisis scenarios stemming from unchecked debt growth: an austerity crisis marked by forced spending cuts and steep tax hikes that could cause a deep recession; a financial crisis triggered by collapsing investor confidence and soaring interest rates; an inflation crisis resulting from excessive money printing; a currency crisis involving a sharp decline in the dollar’s global value; a default crisis, though improbable, that would devastate international markets; and a gradual crisis characterized by long-term stagnation similar to ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropkick Murphys Express Support for Former Officer Michael Fanone After He Wears Band Shirt at Jack Smith Hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 22, 2026, former D.C.

Fanone, who was severely assaulted during the riot and later retired due to PTSD, wore a black Dropkick Murphys T-shirt featuring the slogan 'Fighting Nazis since 1996'—referencing the year the Boston-based Irish American punk band was formed. The band quickly responded on social media with appreciation, posting 'much love' to Fanone for 'standing up for the people,' noting his long-standing support since attending their first Washington, D.C. show in 1996.

While continuing to deny any direct involvement with the Trump Organization, Trump has been accused of intertwining his political influence with private business interests. The report notes new real estate developments in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, both following significant diplomatic or policy interactions with those nations.

Additionally, from March 31, 2026, Qantas will implement a new distance-based award chart specifically for Emirates redemptions, resulting in increases across cabins.

It argues this would disproportionately affect approximately 69 million American women who changed their names after marriage or divorce, as their current legal names often do not match birth certificates, leading to unverifiable status and inability to vote or update registrations. The piece highlights long processing times (weeks to months) for corrected documents, making last-minute fixes impossible, and portrays the timing as a deliberate strategy to suppress women's votes.

This marks a notable shift for Von, who previously supported Trump by hosting him during the 2024 campaign and helping appeal to younger voters.

This popular perk allows a companion to fly for just $99 plus taxes and fees (typically around $121 total) on eligible economy fares within North America on Alaska or Hawaiian Airlines flights. The companion traveler earns redeemable points, qualifies for elite status qualifying activity, and receives the same elite benefits as the primary passenger. For years, despite official terms limiting the fare to one-way or round-trip travel, Alaska permitted flexible bookings including multiple segments, stopovers, and open-jaws in practice. However, following the integration of Hawaiian Airlines and the rollout of a new booking system last fall, this flexibility was removed, restricting users to strict round-trip or one-way options and also blocking the use of Alaska wallet funds for partial payment.

However, it is a temporary state rather than a character flaw, and recovery involves gradual, realistic steps rather than sudden fixes. Key hurdles include low energy and motivation; the article emphasizes starting with small actions—like getting out of bed, opening a window, or completing one task—because waiting for motivation rarely works, and even minor progress can weaken depression's hold. Cognitively, depression distorts neutral events into personal failures, so gently questioning these thoughts—distinguishing facts from feelings—and considering positive overthinking can help. Isolation worsens the condition, making connection vital, even through low-effort interactions like sharing a laugh or sending a message, as human contact counters the brain's insistence on loneliness. Professional support, such as therapy, provides essential spa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/practical-strategies-for-managing-and-overcoming-depression</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/practical-strategies-for-managing-and-overcoming-depression</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ongoing Scientific Challenges in Understanding Consciousness]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores why consciousness remains one of science's most elusive mysteries, tracing its potential evolutionary origins to the Cambrian explosion when complex brains enabled unified sensory experiences, emotions, and self-awareness. It highlights the shift from philosophical dualism to materialism and the field's revival in the 1990s through pioneers like Francis Crick and Christof Koch, who used tools like fMRI to seek neural correlates of consciousness via experiments on visual illusions and binocular rivalry. Despite decades of progress, including maps of brain networks active during awareness and tools to detect consciousness in impaired patients, no consensus exists on its definition or mechanisms. Key theories include global neuronal workspace (GNWT), higher-order theories, predictive processing, and integrated information theory (IIT), which posits consciousness arises from complex, integrated information and even suggests panpsychist implications.

Initially met with shock and confusion in February 2022, public attitudes have shifted significantly due to prolonged conflict, state propaganda, and external pressures. Many Russians now view the war as defensive against perceived Western hostility, fostering widespread anti-Western sentiment and national consolidation. Pride in Russia's resilience amid sanctions, combined with economic growth despite heavy restrictions, has boosted optimism and trust in the nation's viability. The war has spurred technological innovation, reinforced the social contract of state-provided services, low taxes, and public investment, which Russians see as superior to Western models. Cultural shifts include a turn inward after Western 'cancellations,' leading to a boom in domestic arts, tourism, and patriotic figures replacing emigrated celebrities.

Despite the brutal cold, life across the park continues with remarkable resilience, a theme captured through the lens of filmmaker Drew Simms. His video offers a quiet yet powerful meditation on endurance, showcasing how wildlife and geothermal features coexist within a frozen landscape.

Viewers are taken deep into Yellowstone’s winter environment, where frost-covered bison move steadily across snow-laden plains, their thick coats acting as natural insulation. Coyotes appear alert and adaptable, navigating the harsh terrain in search of food, while mountain goats remain watchful along icy ridges. The film also highlights Yellowstone’s iconic geothermal features, with steaming hot springs and geysers creating dramatic contrasts against the surrounding snow and ice.

Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov described the talks as aimed at advancing a political-diplomatic resolution to the war, though he stressed no immediate ceasefire, with Russia continuing its military operations and insisting on territorial concessions based on prior Anchorage agreements as non-negotiable for lasting peace.

Due to significant disparities in military resources, officials anticipate that American forces could seize key land and sea positions within two days to a week. Rather than attempting conventional defense, the strategy shifts to unconventional, insurgency-style tactics inspired by Afghan resistance against Soviet and later U.S.-led forces, including ambushes, sabotage, drone operations, hit-and-run attacks, and improvised explosives. The focus would be on small, mobile units and reservists inflicting ongoing casualties to make occupation costly and difficult. General Jennie Carignan, Chief of the Defence Staff, has publicly outlined plans to expand a volunteer reserve force to over 400,000 members, who could be mobilized for armed resistance or disruptions if the U.S. assumes an occupying role.

Braided cables, often constructed from woven nylon or polyester, are known for their longevity and resistance to fraying and bending. The textured weave provides a firm grip and prevents tangling, making them ideal for travel and demanding work environments. Magnetic charging solutions, such as those offered by Statik, often leverage this design to enhance exterior strength without adding excessive weight. In contrast, silicone cables offer exceptional flexibility and heat resistance, remaining soft even in cold temperatures and minimizing the risk of kinking. Their smooth, rubber-like surface, while comfortable and easy to handle, can be prone to attracting dust and lint. Both types of cables typically utilize copper or aluminum wiring for electrical performance, which remains consistent regardless of the outer material.

La alcaldesa de Cartes, Lorena Cueto (PSOE), ha mostrado su rechazo a la decisión y ha calificado la medida de “castigo” para el municipio.

UU. con Irán y el peso de la energía y las finanzas en el equilibrio geopolítico]]></title><description><![CDATA[El texto es un editorial que interpreta la decisión de Estados Unidos de cancelar en el último momento un ataque contra Irán en junio de 2019 como un acto de cálculo geoestratégico más que de proporcionalidad moral. Según el autor, la clave no estuvo en evitar víctimas, sino en prevenir una escalada que pudiera desestabilizar el sistema energético y financiero global, muy ligado al petróleo y al dólar. A partir de ahí, desarrolla una lectura del orden mundial centrada en infraestructuras, comercio y finanzas, más que en ideologías o principios.

El artículo sostiene que el sistema del petrodólar, nacido en los acuerdos entre EE. UU. y Arabia Saudí en los años setenta, ha sido un pilar de la hegemonía estadounidense, pero muestra fragilidades. Señala hitos como el ataque a instalaciones saudíes en 2019 y la mediación china entre Irán y Arabia Saudí en 2023 como síntomas de un equilibrio más multipolar. China aparece como actor pragmático interesado en la estabilidad para asegurar rutas ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-contencion-de-ee-uu-con-iran-y-el-peso-de-la-energia-y-las-finanzas-en-el-equilibrio-geopolitico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-contencion-de-ee-uu-con-iran-y-el-peso-de-la-energia-y-las-finanzas-en-el-equilibrio-geopolitico</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gianni Fresu analiza la vigencia del pensamiento de Gramsci ante la crisis de hegemonía global]]></title><description><![CDATA[La entrevista publicada por teleSUR recoge una extensa reflexión del filósofo italiano Gianni Fresu sobre la actualidad del pensamiento de Antonio Gramsci en un contexto de crisis política, social y cultural a escala global. Fresu sostiene que vivimos un momento de “éxito hegemónico absoluto” de las clases dominantes, en el que amplios sectores populares acaban apoyando proyectos políticos que refuerzan su propia subordinación. Este fenómeno, explica, se debe a la combinación de neoliberalismo radical, autoritarismo y manipulación digital, lo que denomina una “subversión reaccionaria del mercado”.

El autor subraya que Gramsci no debe leerse como una figura del pasado, sino como un instrumento analítico útil para comprender y transformar la realidad contemporánea, especialmente en el Sur Global. En este sentido, destaca el caso de Brasil como uno de los espacios donde el pensamiento gramsciano ha sido más fértil, al conectar teoría y praxis para analizar las contradicciones históricas ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gianni-fresu-analiza-la-vigencia-del-pensamiento-de-gramsci-ante-la-crisis-de-hegemonia-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gianni-fresu-analiza-la-vigencia-del-pensamiento-de-gramsci-ante-la-crisis-de-hegemonia-global</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Entidades científicas piden suspender un congreso antivacunas en Ciudad Real por su riesgo para la salud pública en medio del repunte de sarampión]]></title><description><![CDATA[Varias entidades científicas y médicas, como el Círculo Escéptico, la APETP, la Confederación Autismo España y la Asociación Española de Profesionales del Autismo, han denunciado públicamente la organización de un congreso titulado 'Daños por vacunas: autismo, enfermedades raras', programado para el 28 de febrero de 2026 en Ciudad Real. El evento, promovido por defensores de terapias alternativas y pseudociencias, incluye ponentes controvertidos como Josep Pàmies y Andreas Kalcker, conocidos por impulsar la 'terapia de la lejía' (MMS), así como médicos expedientados o inhabilitados por difundir ideas sin base científica, como la supuesta relación entre vacunas y autismo.

La noticia destaca que esta convocatoria se produce en un momento preocupante: España experimenta un resurgir del sarampión, una enfermedad erradicada hace una década gracias a las altas coberturas vacunales, pero que ahora vuelve a circular debido a brotes en poblaciones no vacunadas y al auge de movimientos antivacu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entidades-cientificas-piden-suspender-un-congreso-antivacunas-en-ciudad-real-por-su-riesgo-para-la-salud-publica-en-medio-del-repunte-de-sarampion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entidades-cientificas-piden-suspender-un-congreso-antivacunas-en-ciudad-real-por-su-riesgo-para-la-salud-publica-en-medio-del-repunte-de-sarampion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Navarra reduce el precio del alquiler un 8,6% tras aplicar el control de rentas sin caída de la oferta]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de Navarra ha presentado los primeros resultados del control de precios del alquiler tras declarar zonas de mercado tensionadas en 21 municipios, incluida Pamplona. Según los datos oficiales del registro público de contratos, el precio medio del alquiler en estas zonas ha descendido un 8,6% desde la entrada en vigor de la medida el 30 de julio, situándose en 774 euros en el cuarto trimestre de 2025 frente a los 848 euros registrados en el segundo trimestre del mismo año.

Uno de los aspectos más relevantes del balance es que la reducción de precios no ha venido acompañada de una caída de la oferta. Durante el año pasado se firmaron 4.202 contratos de arrendamiento en los municipios tensionados, una cifra muy similar a los 4.176 contratos formalizados en 2024, lo que indica una estabilidad en el número de viviendas disponibles en alquiler.

Este efecto se produce cuando los salarios aumentan para compensar la inflación, pero los tramos y deducciones del impuesto sobre la renta no se actualizan conforme al encarecimiento del coste de la vida. En términos reales, el contribuyente no es más rico, pero acaba pagando más impuestos.

El texto explica que deflactar el IRPF significa ajustar los límites de los tramos y las deducciones a la inflación para evitar subidas fiscales encubiertas. Cuando esto no ocurre, pequeñas subidas salariales pueden situar al contribuyente en un tramo impositivo superior, incrementando el porcentaje de impuestos que paga por una renta que mantiene el mismo poder adquisitivo.

El artículo aporta datos comparativos entre 2018 y 2025 que muestran cómo este efecto perjudica especialmente a las rentas bajas y medias.

El siniestro causó 45 fallecidos y más de un centenar de heridos, convirtiéndose en uno de los más graves en la historia reciente del ferrocarril español. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) lidera la investigación, con informes preliminares que apuntan a una fatiga progresiva no detectada en el carril (fabricado en 2023, en una zona de soldadura con tramo antiguo), agravada por el paso acumulado de trenes previos (al menos 147 pasos de rueda y un peso significativo antes de la fractura total).

La reapertura tiene un especial significado en el caso de Requínoa, cuya estación permanecía cerrada desde mayo de 2017.

Según el Consejo Mundial de Viajes y Turismo (WTTC), esta medida podría disuadir a una parte relevante de visitantes potenciales y traducirse en pérdidas económicas millonarias para el país. A partir de una encuesta a casi 5.000 viajeros frecuentes de distintos países, el WTTC estima que alrededor de un tercio sería menos propenso a viajar a EE.UU. si, para usar el programa de exención de visado (ESTA), tuviera que aportar datos de sus redes sociales. En el peor de los escenarios planteados, el país podría perder hasta 4,7 millones de llegadas internacionales y unos 15.700 millones de dólares en gasto turístico, además de más de 150.000 empleos vinculados al sector.

En una comparecencia ante la prensa, Brunner afirmó que, aunque la Unión Europea trabaja para reducir la migración irregular y endurecer su política común en esta materia, las regularizaciones de personas que ya residen en un país son una cuestión interna de cada Estado.

Tras la denegación, sin explicaciones claras según relata, quedó sin ingresos y llegó a dormir en la calle durante siete meses en condiciones muy duras.

Se destaca el 'Gulag británico' con deportaciones masivas a Australia y otras colonias, la Gran Hambruna irlandesa de 1845-1852 —con exportación de alimentos pese a la muerte de hasta dos millones de personas y condiciones mortales en los barcos 'ataúd'— y las hambrunas en India que causaron hasta 100 millones de muertes entre 1880 y 1920 por políticas coloniales.

Al menos una concejala en activo, un arquitecto municipal del área de Urbanismo y los dos hijos de una alta directiva municipal han adquirido viviendas en la promoción pública Les Naus, construida sobre suelo municipal en la zona de la Condomina. Se trata de la primera promoción de este tipo en la ciudad en los últimos veinte años, en un contexto marcado por la escasez de vivienda y el elevado precio del mercado libre.

La promoción consta de 134 viviendas de tres y cuatro dormitorios, con servicios como piscina, gimnasio y zonas deportivas, levantadas sobre una parcela municipal enajenada en 2022 y adjudicada a una cooperativa privada.

Nacido en 1935 en Brooklyn, desde niño mostró una fuerte inclinación por la lectura y la escritura, especialmente tras descubrir la ciencia ficción a través de cómics y clásicos como Julio Verne y H. G. Wells. Muy joven empezó a publicar relatos en revistas del género y pronto destacó por una productividad fuera de lo común.

Durante los años 50 se convirtió en un autor extremadamente fecundo, capaz de escribir cientos de relatos y numerosas novelas, a menudo bajo seudónimos y adaptándose a las demandas del mercado. Esa etapa le dio éxito económico, pero también desgaste creativo. A finales de la década abandonó temporalmente la ciencia ficción, dedicándose a libros divulgativos y otros trabajos editoriales.

Su gran regreso llegó en los años 60 de la mano de editores como Frederik Pohl y en sintonía con la Nueva Ola de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trayectoria-y-legado-de-robert-silverberg-en-la-ciencia-ficcion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trayectoria-y-legado-de-robert-silverberg-en-la-ciencia-ficcion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El tranvía de Santa Cruz de Tenerife modifica su servicio por obras de mantenimiento este fin de semana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Metrotenerife ha anunciado modificaciones temporales en el servicio del tranvía de Santa Cruz de Tenerife con motivo de una serie de trabajos de mantenimiento programados en la infraestructura ferroviaria. Estas alteraciones afectarán a las líneas 1 y 2 desde el sábado 31 de enero hasta el lunes 2 de febrero de 2026, con el restablecimiento del servicio habitual previsto para el martes 3 de febrero, una vez concluidas las labores técnicas.

Durante este periodo, la Línea 1 funcionará de manera parcial, limitando su recorrido al tramo comprendido entre las paradas de Intercambiador y Chimisay. El resto del trayecto hasta La Trinidad será cubierto por un servicio alternativo de guaguas gratuito, coordinado con la empresa pública TITSA, con el objetivo de garantizar la movilidad de los usuarios afectados.

El origen de los problemas se encuentra en dos incidencias graves localizadas en la provincia de Barcelona: una grieta estructural detectada en la base del túnel de Rubí y un accidente mortal en la línea R4, a la altura de Gelida.

El túnel de Rubí es una infraestructura clave tanto para la línea R8 de pasajeros como para los trenes de carga del Corredor Mediterráneo, principal vía ferroviaria de enlace con Francia. La aparición de una grieta en su estructura ha obligado a suspender el paso de convoyes internacionales, provocando la acumulación de trenes procedentes de Europa en estaciones francesas como Le Soler, en Perpiñán.

Esta medida, que culmina una Iniciativa Legislativa Popular respaldada por más de 600.000 firmas y apoyada inicialmente por casi todos los grupos parlamentarios excepto Vox, busca sacar de la clandestinidad a personas ya integradas en la sociedad y la economía española, principalmente de origen latinoamericano.

Se recuerda que no es una novedad: gobiernos anteriores, como el de José María Aznar en 2000 (524.621 personas) y el de José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero en 2005 (576.506), llevaron a cabo procesos similares. El texto destaca que la regularización no es un privilegio, sino un derecho que permite a estas personas acceder a derechos laborales, protección contra abusos y una vida sin miedo constante a la deportación, mejorando así la calidad del empleo y los ingresos fiscales.

En esas grabaciones, Erika se dirige al equipo de Turning Point para agradecer su esfuerzo en la organización del acto conmemorativo, destacando el número de asistentes, nuevas donaciones y ventas de merchandising. Sus comentarios, centrados en cifras y resultados, generaron un fuerte rechazo en redes sociales, donde muchos internautas consideraron inapropiado el tono optimista y el enfoque orientado a resultados tan poco tiempo después de la tragedia.

Este aumento se debe a la diversificación del modelo productivo, que ya no depende exclusivamente del turismo y la construcción, sino que incorpora la digitalización y la sostenibilidad, impulsadas por los fondos europeos Next Generation. La adopción de inteligencia artificial en sectores de servicios avanzados como finanzas, logística, comercio y turismo ha elevado la productividad de la economía.

Como respuesta, la marca ha confirmado el cierre de alrededor del 30% de su red de concesionarios, pasando de 150 a finales de 2024 y 114 a finales de 2025, hasta un objetivo de unos 80 en 2026. Según Pan Liqi, responsable de Porsche China, esta medida busca reducir costes y redirigir recursos hacia I+D, incluyendo su nuevo centro en Shanghái.

El tren circulará en días laborables acoplado a un convoy de pasajeros de la serie E5 Yamabiko, mientras que las operaciones de carga y descarga se realizarán en depósitos cercanos a las grandes estaciones para no interferir con el flujo de viajeros.

Consciente del fallo, Cervantes intentó corregirlo ese mismo año introduciendo dos pasajes nuevos en una segunda edición: uno que explicaba el robo del burro por un galeote y otro en el que Sancho relataba su recuperación. Sin embargo, esta solución resultó defectuosa, ya que el robo se insertó antes de la última mención previa del animal, generando nuevas contradicciones.

A raíz de estas discusiones, surgió una pregunta clave: ¿qué ocurriría si el repositorio Git principal de Linus Torvalds desapareciera o dejara de estar accesible?

La respuesta llega en forma de un documento oficial de continuidad elaborado tras la Cumbre de Mantenedores de Linux de 2025. En él se explica que el desarrollo del kernel no depende exclusivamente de una única persona ni de un único repositorio. Actualmente, el proyecto cuenta con más de un centenar de mantenedores que trabajan de manera distribuida en sus propios repositorios, enviando posteriormente los cambios al repositorio principal.

Aunque Linus Torvalds suele encargarse de integrar las contribuciones finales, existen precedentes claros de que otros desarrolladores pueden asumir ese rol. Un ejemplo fue la versión 4.19 del ke]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-kernel-de-linux-tiene-un-plan-de-continuidad-aunque-el-repositorio-de-linus-torvalds-deje-de-estar-disponible</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-kernel-de-linux-tiene-un-plan-de-continuidad-aunque-el-repositorio-de-linus-torvalds-deje-de-estar-disponible</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflexión sobre el arte de la comedia y las bromas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo explora el mundo de la comedia y las bromas a través de la figura del cómico profesional. Se analiza cómo un humorista experto construye sus rutinas, combinando observación cotidiana, timing perfecto y un toque de exageración para conectar con el público. El texto destaca la diferencia entre una simple broma casual y el arte elaborado de un monólogo, donde cada palabra cuenta y el contexto es clave para el impacto. Se menciona el caso de un cómico que, tras años de experiencia, domina el escenario recurriendo a anécdotas personales transformadas en chistes universales. Además, se reflexiona sobre los límites del humor, especialmente en tiempos de sensibilidad social, donde lo que antes provocaba carcajadas hoy puede generar controversia. El autor enfatiza la importancia de la inteligencia emocional en el comediante para leer al público y ajustar su actuación en tiempo real.

Sin embargo, Noelia no es una persona real, sino un avatar creado mediante inteligencia artificial, sin que el perfil lo indique claramente en su biografía o publicaciones. Esto provoca que muchos seguidores crean que es auténtica, lo que genera comentarios machistas, sexistas y de odio hacia la presencia de mujeres en el arbitraje, como frases que cuestionan su profesionalidad o insinúan conductas inapropiadas.

La producción, creada por Ronald D. Moore, alcanzará un hito importante con el estreno de su quinta temporada el próximo 27 de marzo, convirtiéndose en la serie de ciencia ficción más longeva de la plataforma. Aunque nunca ha sido un fenómeno masivo en redes sociales, la ficción cuenta con un sólido respaldo de crítica y público, reflejado en su valoración de 8,1 sobre 10 en IMDb con más de 40.000 votos.

La serie parte de una ucronía: un escenario alternativo en el que la Unión Soviética llega antes que Estados Unidos a la Luna. Este cambio histórico provoca una reacción en cadena que impulsa la carrera espacial durante décadas, alterando la política, la tecnología y la cultura global.

Además, el Ayuntamiento ha admitido la necesidad de una tala masiva de pinos debido a la sequía y la infestación por escarabajos, prometiendo la plantación de más de 6.300 árboles en los próximos cuatro años para compensar las pérdidas.

En ese mensaje advirtió de la existencia de fallecimientos evitables y pidió no cargar esa responsabilidad sobre ninguna autoridad.

Aunque los gobiernos suelen presentarlos como motores de crecimiento, con beneficios en PIB, turismo, empleo e imagen internacional, la evidencia empírica entre 2000 y 2024 muestra resultados poco alentadores. En la mayoría de casos, no se observa un impacto macroeconómico significativo ni sostenido. Ejemplos como Brasil con Río 2016 o Rusia 2018 demuestran que ni el crecimiento económico ni el turismo experimentaron mejoras duraderas atribuibles al evento. Los costes, en cambio, son enormes: Qatar 2022 superó los 220.000 millones de dólares y muchos estadios se convierten en 'elefantes blancos', infraestructuras sobredimensionadas, infrautilizadas y caras de mantener, que generan deuda pública a largo plazo.

El sistema ferroviario nigeriano tiene un origen histórico ligado al transporte de mercancías hacia los puertos durante la etapa colonial. Con el tiempo, el Estado asumió el control y consolidó una red nacional que alcanzó su mayor extensión en 1964, al completarse la línea hasta Maiduguri.

A pesar del incidente, Omar rechazó atención médica adicional y continuó con su intervención pública, pidiendo no dar protagonismo al atacante.

El hermano menor de Kazmierczak, en declaraciones exclusivas a The Independent, lo describió como un extremista de derecha con problemas de ira de larga duración y un profundo odio hacia la comunidad somalí, al que atribuye una obsesión prolongada con Ilhan Omar.

Destaca su fuerte rechazo a la presencia de las cámaras y micrófonos de Netflix durante el Tour de Francia, considerándolos invasivos: se colaban en el autobús del equipo, capturaban momentos de frustración tras las etapas y, según él, sacaban situaciones de contexto para crear narrativas sensacionalistas, como un clip donde parecía que el jefe le gritaba sin mostrar el acuerdo previo de que pararía. Aunque los equipos recibían dinero por permitirlo y tenían cierto control editorial, O’Connor cree que se priorizaba el espectáculo sobre la realidad. Habla también de la enorme presión vivida en su anterior equipo francés (Decathlon AG2R), donde un cuarto puesto en el Tour lo convirtió en el centro absoluto, contrastando con la honestidad y claridad en la comunicación del equipo australiano actual.

El autor denuncia que, desde hace décadas, las políticas ferroviarias han priorizado la alta velocidad y un diseño radial centrado en Madrid, en detrimento de las líneas tradicionales que conectaban pueblos y ciudades intermedias. Como ejemplo simbólico, recuerda el cierre en 1984 de la Ruta de la Plata, que unía Gijón y Sevilla y articulaba el noroeste peninsular, sacrificada por un modelo que apostaba por grandes infraestructuras más vistosas y rentables políticamente.

Según el texto, este enfoque ha sido compartido por gobiernos de distinto signo y ha generado enormes costes económicos, tanto en construcción como en mantenimiento, además de oportunidades de corrupción ligadas a expropiaciones y sobrecostes. El resultado es un sistema de trenes rápidos, caros y con pocas paradas, pensado para viajeros urbanos con alto]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-ferroviario-espanol-y-sus-efectos-alta-velocidad-centralismo-y-exclusion-territorial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-modelo-ferroviario-espanol-y-sus-efectos-alta-velocidad-centralismo-y-exclusion-territorial</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homenaje a El Loko Dope: del Hip Hop activista en San Bernardo a su trágica muerte]]></title><description><![CDATA[Emilio Santiago Muíño recuerda con profundo cariño y tristeza a El Loko Dope, un rapero y militante del colectivo Hip Hop URRAP en San Bernardo (Santiago de Chile), a quien conoció en 2007 durante su etapa en la Red de Hip Hop Activista. Dope, procedente de un entorno marginal, superó una adicción a la pasta base gracias al Hip Hop político y la educación popular, convirtiéndose en un ejemplo de transformación personal y compromiso comunitario. Participó en talleres, festivales y grabaciones, inspirando al autor en su propio activismo en España con el proyecto Rompe el Círculo. Años después, Dope recayó en las drogas tras una depresión y vivió en situación de calle, pero mantuvo su bondad y reciprocidad. En 2022 se supo de su deterioro, y recientemente, en 2026, amigos informaron que fue asesinado de forma brutal: rociado con gasolina y quemado vivo por tres criminales en plena calle.

Después de años siendo una pieza clave en equipos como Quick-Step y Lidl-Trek, el belga reflexiona con honestidad sobre los sueños, los límites y la evolución del ciclismo de élite. Reconoce que, como casi todos, aspiraba a ser un corredor explosivo capaz de ganar carreras, como Alejandro Valverde o Tom Boonen, pero que con el tiempo entendió qué tipo de ciclista podía ser y cómo aportar valor al equipo desde otro rol.

Desde esa experiencia analiza también el ciclismo actual. Considera que Remco Evenepoel ha dado pasos importantes hacia la general del Tour, aunque todavía necesita un salto extra para competir por la victoria, y sitúa a Tadej Pogačar en una dimensión claramente superior, especialmente en la montaña. Incluso sin el esloveno, ve un Tour muy abierto entre corredores como Ayuso o Almeida.

El autor argumenta que estos partidos votan sistemáticamente en contra de medidas que beneficiarían a la mayoría de la población, como la revalorización de las pensiones, la subida del Ingreso Mínimo Vital, el incremento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional, la paralización de desahucios, el mantenimiento del Bono Social eléctrico o las ayudas para vehículos no contaminantes, afectados por desastres naturales como DANAs e incendios, y la congelación de cotizaciones para autónomos.

Se destaca la desconexión de estos políticos con la realidad de la ciudadanía: se mencionan los elevados ingresos de líderes como Alberto Núñez Feijoo (alrededor de 177.000 euros brutos anuales), Santiago Abascal (59.200 euros) y Mirian Nogueras (134.288 euros), así como sus propiedades]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-la-derecha-espanola-por-oponerse-a-medidas-sociales-como-la-subida-de-pensiones-e-ingreso-minimo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/critica-a-la-derecha-espanola-por-oponerse-a-medidas-sociales-como-la-subida-de-pensiones-e-ingreso-minimo</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 10:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resumen meteorológico semanal en España: tormentas intensas en el suroeste, descenso térmico y vientos variables (3-9 noviembre 2025)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante la semana del 3 al 9 de noviembre de 2025, el tiempo en España mostró una evolución marcada. Comenzó con un patrón de NAO positiva y circulación ondulada a bajas latitudes, pasando luego a un bloqueo escandinavo.

El jueves destacaron tormentas en Cataluña y Baleares, y el viernes lluvias persistentes en el Cantábrico. El fin de semana trajo precipitaciones más débiles y persistentes en zonas atlánticas y Baleares.

Las temperaturas máximas presentaron anomalías positivas al inicio (lunes-miércoles), pero descendieron notablemente a partir del jueves, con predominio de valores negativos en gran parte de la Península (descenso medio semanal de 1,8 °C).

Alex Pretti, un enfermero de cuidados intensivos de 37 años, fue abatido a tiros el sábado anterior tras un altercado captado en vídeo: agentes lo rociaron con pimienta, lo redujeron y le dispararon múltiples veces (hasta 10 impactos) después de que intentara ayudar a una mujer y grabara la escena con su móvil.

La acusación sostenía que el contenido de sus temas, crítico con la policía, podía constituir un delito de odio. Sin embargo, la banda defendió desde el principio que el delito de odio está pensado para proteger a colectivos vulnerables frente a prejuicios por raza, ideología, religión, orientación sexual, identidad de género, enfermedad o discapacidad, y que cuerpos como la policía, el ejército, grandes empresarios, religiosos o políticos no entran en esa categoría.

La Fed decidió mantener sin cambios su tipo de interés clave en el rango del 3,50% al 3,75%, poniendo fin a tres recortes consecutivos de 25 puntos básicos realizados en 2025. Esta decisión contó con dos disidencias de los gobernadores Stephen Miran y Christopher Waller, que preferían un nuevo recorte.

Powell indicó que la inflación en diciembre seguía claramente por encima del objetivo del 2%, con el índice subyacente de gastos de consumo personal (PCE) estimado en torno al 3%. Atribuyó esta elevada lectura principalmente al sector de bienes, impulsado por los efectos de los aranceles impuestos por la administración Trump. En contraste, señaló que la desinflación continúa en el sector servicios. Excluyendo el impacto de los aranceles en los bienes, el PCE subyacente estaría solo ligeramente por encima del 2%, lo que co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fed-mantiene-los-tipos-en-el-3-50-3-75-powell-atribuye-la-inflacion-elevada-principalmente-a-los-aranceles</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fed-mantiene-los-tipos-en-el-3-50-3-75-powell-atribuye-la-inflacion-elevada-principalmente-a-los-aranceles</guid><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rescatan sano y salvo en aguas de Argelia al tripulante de un velero desaparecido desde el 15 de enero tras salir de Gandia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un hombre de 69 años, con escasos conocimientos de navegación, partió el 15 de enero desde el puerto de Gandia (Valencia) en el velero 'Admirante' con destino a Guardamar del Segura (Alicante).

La secuencia, que dura menos de 20 segundos, registra desde el impacto inicial —con destellos, chispas y la pérdida del depósito de combustible externo— hasta la rotura completa del fuselaje y la caída en espiral de las diferentes partes del avión, incluida la sección delantera con la cabina.

La empresa obtuvo un beneficio neto de 3.794 millones de dólares (aproximadamente 3.181 millones de euros), lo que supone un descenso del 46,5% respecto al año anterior. Este retroceso se explica principalmente por el aumento de costes, los aranceles impuestos en Estados Unidos, el fin de los incentivos fiscales a la compra de eléctricos en ese país desde septiembre y, especialmente, por una fuerte caída en las ventas en Europa, donde se registraron descensos de hasta el 50% en mercados importantes, parcialmente atribuida al apoyo público de Musk a partidos de ultraderecha.

Los ingresos totales se redujeron un 3%, hasta los 94.827 millones de dólares (79.496 millones de euros).

Esta ventaja china se basa en avances tecnológicos como vehículos planeadores hipersónicos y sistemas de ataque orbital fraccionado (FOBS), probados desde 2021, que permiten trayectorias impredecibles y evaden radares de alerta temprana.

El aparato, con el número táctico '21 Blue', fue alcanzado por un misil aire-aire de largo alcance R-37M (probablemente disparado por un caza ruso Su-35S o MiG-31BM), lo que provocó una rápida desintegración: un destello inicial, chispas, la separación de un tanque de combustible externo, el fuselaje abierto exponiendo el tren de aterrizaje y el avión girando descontroladamente hasta estrellarse en menos de 20 segundos. El piloto, Stanislav Rykov, de la 299.ª Brigada de Aviación Táctica, falleció en el incidente ocurrido el 7 de febrero de 2024 cerca de Novotroitske, en la región de Donetsk.

Lejos de un discurso tecnófobo o de una denuncia abstracta de “lo digital”, el libro se centra en cómo los sistemas de recomendación organizan de forma concreta nuestra experiencia cultural: qué vemos, qué leemos y qué consideramos relevante. Fernández parte de una idea incómoda pero central: hoy ya no es necesaria la censura explícita, basta con que determinados contenidos queden fuera del campo de visión algorítmico para que, de facto, desaparezcan.

El texto contrapone la distopía clásica del control represivo con un escenario más cercano a Un mundo feliz, donde la comodidad, la fluidez y la amabilidad del entorno reducen la fricción y, con ella, la posibilidad de una atención crítica.

A pesar de la rápida intervención de Policía Local, Policía Nacional, Bomberos de Sevilla y Dos Hermanas, así como de los servicios sanitarios del 061, solo se pudo confirmar el fallecimiento. El suceso ocurrió en un contexto de aviso naranja meteorológico por rachas de viento de hasta 90 km/h, lo que llevó a los sindicatos CCOO y UGT a denunciar que no se suspendieron trabajos peligrosos pese a las condiciones adversas.

Se trata de utensilios prácticamente indestructibles que mejoran con el uso si se cuidan bien, ya que desarrollan una capa antiadherente natural llamada 'seasoning' a base de polimerización de grasas. Son ideales para freír, saltear, hacer a la plancha y cocinar en el horno, ya que retienen muy bien el calor, permiten altas temperaturas y se pueden usar en todo tipo de fuegos (gas, inducción, vitrocerámica). Además, son relativamente económicas y duran generaciones si se mantienen correctamente.

Sin embargo, presentan varias desventajas importantes. Requieren cuidados constantes: hay que crear y preservar esa capa antiadherente evitando estropajos abrasivos, usando poco jabón, secándolas inmediatamente para prevenir la oxidación y engrasándolas después de cada uso.

La propietaria es la Venerable Orden Tercera (VOT), una institución religiosa franciscana que posee más de 300 pisos en el centro de Madrid. El desahucio se justifica por la necesidad de reformas tras el derrumbe del techo de la cocina el 8 de noviembre de 2025, causado por años de abandono y falta de mantenimiento por parte de la orden.

Tradicionalmente, los modelos más estudiados de teoría de cuerdas generaban universos con energía negativa o nula (espacios anti-de Sitter), lo que chocaba con nuestra realidad cosmológica de espacio de Sitter positivo.

Los investigadores utilizan el efecto Casimir en las dimensiones extra compactadas en una variedad de Riemann plana de 6D (similar a un toro generalizado), combinado con flujos para equilibrar fuerzas y obtener una energía oscura positiva aunque pequeña (del orden de 10^-15 en unidades de Planck, aún lejos del valor observado de 10^-120, pero en la dirección correcta).

Según el autor, el objetivo no era el belicismo en sí, sino evitar que potencias extranjeras condicionaran el futuro político del país.

La entrada sostiene que el asesinato de Carrero Blanco no fue solo una acción de ETA, sino que contó con la connivencia de intereses estadounidenses, interesados en modelar la Transición española y, sobre todo, en impedir que España accediera a la disuasión nuclear.

La aprobación se produjo sin debate abierto por parte del PP ni de la propia Herrero, que evitó intervenir tras retirar su moción inicial e integrarla como alternativa a las presentadas por Compromís y el Partido Socialista. Esta maniobra parlamentaria permitió sortear la discusión directa sobre su situación judicial y facilitó un apoyo silencioso del PP, que necesita a Vox para mantener la mayoría municipal. De este modo, solo intervinieron los grupos de la oposición.

La medida forma parte de una estrategia más amplia para reducir la dependencia tecnológica de servicios procedentes de Estados Unidos y trasladar las comunicaciones oficiales a soluciones desarrolladas y alojadas en Francia.

La decisión se materializará a través de una notificación oficial preparada por la Oficina del Primer Ministro, que obligará a los empleados del Estado a utilizar Visio, una herramienta de videoconferencia diseñada por la Dirección Interministerial de lo Digital (Dinum). Esta plataforma funciona sobre infraestructuras de Outscale, una empresa francesa especializada en servicios en la nube, lo que garantiza que los datos permanezcan bajo control nacional.

El acuerdo permitirá reemplazar progresivamente los CN235 y C212 del Ejército del Aire y del Espacio, al tiempo que consolida una flota homogénea y moderna orientada al transporte ligero, la formación de tripulaciones y el lanzamiento de paracaidistas.

La compra se estructura en dos fases. Un primer lote de 12 aviones se destinará a la Escuela Militar de Transporte Aéreo en la base de Matacán, donde asumirán tareas de instrucción, transporte de personal y carga. El segundo lote, compuesto por seis aeronaves, irá a la Escuela Militar de Paracaidismo de Alcantarilla para misiones específicas de lanzamiento de paracaidistas y carga, sustituyendo a los veteranos C212.

En esta ocasión, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, fue el centro de atención, gracias al ingenioso coro 'La Carnicería', dirigido por Miguel Ángel García Argüez, 'el Chapa'. A través de un tango satírico, el coro gaditano hizo un repaso de las acciones y decisiones más controvertidas de Trump, utilizando un juego de palabras con 'USA'. La letra del tango no dejó de lado temas como la manipulación de la democracia, el uso de las armas y la diplomacia, la división social y las noticias falsas. En un tono mordaz y con la risa del público como fondo, el coro no dudó en calificar al mandatario estadounidense de 'hijo de puta', mientras los asistentes se entregaban al ritmo del carnaval. Este tipo de críticas, acompañadas de sátira política, son una tradición en el Carnaval de Cádiz, donde se mezcla la denuncia social con el buen humor y la música.

Su sustitución será ocupada por María José Lluri, alcaldesa de la localidad de Lluri, quien en 2021 fue condenada por conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol. Esta situación ha generado controversia en la esfera política española, dada la sensibilidad del tema y la relevancia del cargo que asume la nueva diputada. Ábalos, figura clave en el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez en el pasado, ha declinado explicar los motivos de su salida, aunque se especula con posibles implicaciones derivadas de investigaciones judiciales en curso.

Esta declaración surge en medio de una fuerte polémica por la muerte de Alex Pretti, un hombre de 37 años abatido por agentes federales en Minneapolis el sábado 24 de enero de 2026. Noem y otros funcionarios de la administración afirmaron inicialmente que Pretti pretendía 'masacrar' a los agentes y que estaba armado, calificándolo incluso como un 'asesino' en el caso de Miller. Sin embargo, pruebas en vídeo contradicen parcialmente estas afirmaciones, ya que muestran que Pretti no blandió el arma de manera amenazante antes de ser disparado, lo que ha generado confusión y críticas internas en la Casa Blanca.

Tras más de 30 años en la policía, incluyendo 10 años en la unidad de Negociación de Rehenes y Crisis, Perfect comparte tres técnicas clave que aprendió en su trabajo y que pueden ayudar a los padres a mantener la calma y el control en situaciones de conflicto con sus hijos. Estas técnicas incluyen ofrecer una 'opción sin opción' para dar a los niños una sensación de control, esperar 90 segundos antes de responder para evitar reacciones emocionales, y mirar la situación desde la perspectiva del niño para comprender sus motivaciones.

Insistió en que la regularización de migrantes irregulares anunciada por el Ejecutivo busca incrementar artificialmente el censo electoral, a pesar de que esta medida solo otorga permiso de residencia y trabajo, no la nacionalidad ni el derecho a voto. Feijóo elevó la cifra de beneficiarios a más de 800.000 personas, frente a las cerca de 500.000 estimadas por el Gobierno, y la calificó de 'masiva e improvisada', contraria a la normativa europea y generadora de un efecto llamada. Además, la tachó de cortina de humo para desviar la atención del accidente ferroviario en Catalunya.

La periodista Silvia Intxaurrondo intervino en un programa de TVE para clarificar el contenido del decreto, contrastando la explicación de Miriam Nogueras, portavoz de Junts, con los detalles concretos del texto. Intxaurrondo explicó que la suspensión de desahucios solo se aplicaba a casos muy específicos: cuando el propietario es una persona jurídica o con más de diez viviendas, el ocupante es vulnerable, víctima de violencia de género o con menores a su cargo, y siempre que no afecte a la primera vivienda del propietario ni a segundas residencias.

Durante la sesión de fotos y vídeo, Noem sostuvo un fusil M4 carbine cuyo cañón se inclinó hacia la cabeza y el rostro de uno de los agentes a su lado, lo que constituye una violación clara de la regla fundamental de seguridad armamentística conocida como 'muzzle sweep' (barrido del cañón). Esta norma exige mantener siempre el arma apuntando en una dirección segura y nunca hacia personas o elementos que no se pretenda destruir.

Expertos en armas de fuego de Wyoming, como el exagente de la paz y entrenador Frank Groth y el instructor certificado por la NRA Vince Vanata (exmarine y oficial de seguridad en campos de tiro), coincidieron en que esta acción fue imprudente.

El texto se apoya en declaraciones atribuidas a figuras como el general Wesley Clark y el economista Jeffrey Sachs para argumentar que la lista de países atacados o desestabilizados por Washington tras el 11-S —Irak, Siria, Líbano, Libia, Somalia, Sudán e Irán— respondería principalmente a prioridades de seguridad israelíes, y no a amenazas reales para Estados Unidos.

Edwin J. Saltzman, ingeniero aeroespacial de la NASA en el Dryden Flight Research Center, tuvo la idea de mejorar su eficiencia mientras iba al trabajo en bicicleta y notaba cómo los camiones le generaban turbulencias: primero lo empujaban hacia un lado y luego lo atraían hacia la carretera debido al flujo de aire y al vacío creado a su paso.

Motivado por esta observación, Saltzman y su equipo utilizaron una furgoneta Ford modificada, recubierta con paneles de aluminio para crear una forma de referencia cuadrada. Realizaron pruebas en carretera (sin túnel de viento) añadiendo tiras para visualizar el flujo de aire y probando diferentes configuraciones: redondeo de esquinas delanteras, carenado de bajos y modificaciones en la parte trasera.

Estos agentes colaborarán en la evaluación de riesgos de criminalidad transnacional, apoyando al Servicio de Seguridad Diplomática de EE.UU., y trabajarán solo desde instalaciones diplomáticas como el consulado en Milán, sin potestad ejecutiva en suelo italiano ni posibilidad de realizar detenciones o redadas.

En los últimos 50 años (1976-2025), la duración media de estos episodios se ha reducido a un ritmo de 1,2 días por década. Actualmente, se podría estar ante el tercer invierno consecutivo sin olas de frío oficiales (definidas por AEMET como al menos tres días consecutivos con mínimas por debajo del percentil 5 % en al menos el 10 % de las estaciones durante enero y febrero). Los dos inviernos anteriores (2023-2024 y 2024-2025) ya no registraron ninguno, algo sin precedentes en los registros históricos.

Mientras tanto, las olas de calor se han duplicado en la última década (30 frente a 13 en 2006-2015) y han sido continuas desde 2015. Las provincias más afectadas por olas de frío históricas son Huesca y Tarragona, seguidas de León y Guadalajara, debido a la entrada de masas de aire continental.

Este número supera los 762 casos del brote de West Texas ocurrido entre enero y agosto de 2025, que resultó en la muerte de dos niños en edad escolar. Se trata del brote de sarampión más grande que ha enfrentado Estados Unidos en casi tres décadas. El epicentro se encuentra en el condado de Spartanburg, donde el virus se propagó inicialmente en octubre del año pasado en varias escuelas primarias y secundarias, muchas de ellas privadas y cristianas, con un alto porcentaje de alumnos no vacunados. Las reuniones familiares durante las fiestas y los viajes aceleraron la expansión.

Según los datos disponibles hasta el momento, el arresto estaría relacionado con una antigua orden de deportación que seguía activa en su expediente migratorio.

Esta normativa restringe manifestaciones que consideren promoción de la homosexualidad ante menores, permitiendo prohibiciones y uso de reconocimiento facial. Karácsony intentó sortear la prohibición policial clasificándolo como acto municipal, lo que permitió que se celebrara sin incidentes graves y con una participación masiva de entre 100.000 y 300.000 personas, convirtiéndose en una gran manifestación contra las políticas homófobas de Orbán. La acusación formal es por violar la legislación sobre asociación y reunión pública al ignorar la orden policial de prohibición.

Estos errores han aumentado el malestar entre usuarios y expertos, y han reforzado la percepción de que la compañía ha priorizado el desarrollo de la inteligencia artificial Copilot en detrimento de la estabilidad y evolución del sistema operativo.

La situación ya tiene consecuencias medibles. Según datos de Statcounter, Windows 11 lleva dos meses consecutivos perdiendo cuota de mercado, mientras Windows 10 vuelve a ganar usuarios. Este retroceso resulta especialmente preocupante teniendo en cuenta que Microsoft planea poner fin al soporte extendido de Windows 10 en octubre, lo que podría dejar a muchos equipos sin actualizaciones de seguridad si no migran a tiempo.

Estas microalgas generan de forma natural ácidos grasos omega-3 (especialmente DHA), replicando el mecanismo por el cual los peces obtienen estos compuestos al consumir algas marinas. El resultado son ingredientes sostenibles que sustituyen al aceite de pescado en piensos para acuicultura y alimentos para mascotas, reduciendo la presión sobre los océanos y la sobrepesca de especies pelágicas pequeñas. El modelo se basa en la economía circular: producción modular y descentralizada cerca de destilerías y clientes, lo que minimiza el transporte y la huella de carbono.

A lo largo de las décadas, análisis posteriores, como los de Gaya Herrington y Graham Turner, han validado los escenarios de colapso planteados en el informe, demostrando que la humanidad ha excedido varios límites planetarios. El artículo sostiene que no se trata de evitar el colapso, sino de cómo gestionar los límites del crecimiento: si mediante una transición planificada hacia un modelo económico sostenible o enfrentando un colapso descontrolado.

A partir de la investigación de la historiadora Victoria López Barahona, se examina cómo el sistema económico y social de la época encauzó a las mujeres hacia determinados oficios considerados apropiados para su género, limitando de forma sistemática sus posibilidades de promoción profesional y su acceso a la maestría dentro del mundo artesanal.

Uno de los aspectos centrales abordados es la precarización y el abaratamiento del trabajo femenino, especialmente visible en actividades como el hilado. Muchas mujeres, conocidas como hilanderas, realizaban este trabajo por encargo desde sus hogares o en entornos rurales dispersos, combinándolo con las labores agrícolas y domésticas.

La misión constará de dos sondas independientes, cada una con una masa máxima de 8,2 toneladas, lo que permitirá su lanzamiento con el cohete Larga Marcha 5 (CZ-5). Una sonda se dirigirá hacia la cola de la heliosfera, con lanzamiento previsto para abril de 2032, un sobrevuelo de Júpiter y llegada a su destino en 2059 tras recorrer 130 unidades astronómicas (unos 19.500 millones de kilómetros). La otra sonda apuntará al frente de choque de la heliosfera, zona ya explorada parcialmente por las Voyager, con despegue en noviembre de 2033 y llegada a la heliopausa en 2053 tras 70 UA, empleando asistencias gravitatorias de la Tierra y Júpiter.

Este hallazgo retrasa en al menos 40.000 años la evidencia anterior de herramientas de madera manipuladas, ya que las más antiguas conocidas procedían de lugares como Reino Unido, Zambia, Alemania o China, pero son más recientes.

En 2024, la filial Elche Crevillente Salud SAU, que gestiona el hospital del Vinalopó, registró ingresos de 191 millones de euros y un beneficio neto de 11 millones, gracias en parte a un incremento de 40 millones en los pagos de la Generalitat Valenciana tras la ampliación de la concesión por el gobierno del PP. En contraste, Torrejón Salud, que opera el hospital de Torrejón en Madrid, ingresó 123,5 millones (casi todo de la Comunidad de Madrid) pero cerró con pérdidas de 7,9 millones. La diferencia se atribuye a la cápita mucho más alta en Valencia (1.066 euros por paciente) frente a Madrid (581 euros).

El caso se centra en si el tiempo de servicios prestados por un enfermero en el Hospital San Roque Maspalomas, un centro privado concertado, debe valorarse a efectos de carrera profesional al pasar a trabajar en la sanidad pública.

El Alto Tribunal establece como doctrina jurisprudencial que la legislación vigente impide considerar los centros sanitarios privados concertados como integrados en el Sistema Nacional de Salud (SNS) solo por el hecho del concierto. Por tanto, el tiempo trabajado en ellos no es equiparable al prestado en instituciones públicas, ni siquiera si los servicios se realizaron en el marco del concierto sanitario.

Estos organismos, considerados ancestros remotos de los vertebrados actuales, poseían un sistema visual único compuesto por cuatro ojos: dos grandes laterales y dos centrales más pequeños pero completamente funcionales, con lentes y retinas que contenían melanosomas para absorber la luz, lo que les otorgaba una agudeza visual avanzada para la época del Cámbrico.

El estudio, publicado en la revista Nature, muestra cómo estos ojos centrales acabaron evolucionando hacia la glándula pineal moderna, que en los vertebrados actuales regula los ritmos circadianos mediante la producción de melatonina en respuesta a la luz. Inicialmente capaces de formar imágenes nítidas, estos ojos centrales se redujeron con el tiempo, perdieron su función visual y migraron al interior del cráneo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fosiles-de-peces-con-cuatro-ojos-revelan-la-evolucion-del-sistema-visual-y-la-glandula-pineal-en-vertebrados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fosiles-de-peces-con-cuatro-ojos-revelan-la-evolucion-del-sistema-visual-y-la-glandula-pineal-en-vertebrados</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 14:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Monte Athos y sus vetos históricos: avaton, monacato ortodoxo y la huella de la Venganza Catalana]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza uno de los anacronismos más persistentes del continente europeo: el régimen de exclusiones del Monte Athos, una república monástica ortodoxa situada en el norte de Grecia que, desde hace más de mil años, mantiene normas propias al margen de la evolución social europea. Aunque pertenece formalmente al Estado griego, Athos goza de una autonomía reconocida históricamente por imperios, monarquías y, en tiempos recientes, por la Unión Europea.

La base de este sistema es el avaton, una norma vigente desde 1046 cuyo objetivo es preservar la vida ascética de los monjes. Bajo esta lógica se prohibió la entrada de mujeres, sin excepción, al considerarlas una distracción espiritual. Esta exclusión se extendió también a las hembras de animales domésticos, con el fin de evitar cualquier simbolismo asociado a la feminidad, aunque la práctica obligó a introducir excepciones pragmáticas, como gatos o gallinas.

A pesar de que la Fiscalía aprecia intereses espurios en la operación, Pedraz concluye que no existe base para calificar como montaje policial la investigación iniciada en 2016 contra Urbán por supuestamente vender 40 kilos de cocaína en un bar de Malasaña, Madrid. Esta pesquisa se basó en el testimonio de un confidente que relató un intercambio disparatado: Urbán cargando la droga a pulso, celebrando la transacción a gritos y afirmando que provenía de Venezuela para financiar a Podemos, e incluso volcándola en la barra del local para que los clientes la consumieran.

Junto al abogado Eduardo Santos Itoiz, facilitador de procesos restaurativos y consejero-secretario del Consejo de Navarra, relató su experiencia personal con la justicia restaurativa. Lasa explicó que se reunió con tres de los responsables del asesinato de su marido, lo que le permitió interrogarles, obtener respuestas y reconocer el daño causado, algo que no pudo hacer en el juicio de la Audiencia Nacional. Afirmó que este proceso resultó 'más curativo que una condena de treinta años', ya que le ayudó a comprender y humanizar a los exmiembros de ETA, quienes, tras años en prisión y reflexión, ya no son las mismas personas de entonces.

Esta situación, agravada desde la pandemia, ha llevado a varios centros a contratar empresas especializadas en la organización y supervisión de salidas, como Divertos. Malores Villanueva, directora del IES Álvaro Cunqueiro, explica que hace dos cursos tuvieron que recurrir a una empresa porque ningún profesor quiso ir, y este año han limitado las excursiones solo a 4º de ESO para evitar contactar de nuevo con ellas en 3º. Marivíc García, responsable de Divertos, confirma que la demanda ha aumentado: depende de la promoción, ya que algunas son más problemáticas y los centros prefieren evitar incidencias.

Según el documento, dos agentes federales —un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (BPA) y un agente de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBPO)— efectuaron disparos con sus armas reglamentarias durante un forcejeo con Pretti.

El informe se basa en una revisión preliminar de las grabaciones de las cámaras corporales de los agentes y de la documentación oficial de CBP presente en el lugar de los hechos. En ningún momento se afirma que Pretti intentara coger su arma, aunque sí se recoge que, durante el forcejeo, uno de los agentes gritó repetidamente “¡Tiene un arma!” antes de que se produjeran los disparos. Aproximadamente cinco segundos después de esos gritos, ambos agentes dispararon: uno con una Glock 19 y otro con u]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-informe-del-dhs-detalla-la-actuacion-de-dos-agentes-federales-en-la-muerte-de-alex-pretti-en-minneapolis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-informe-del-dhs-detalla-la-actuacion-de-dos-agentes-federales-en-la-muerte-de-alex-pretti-en-minneapolis</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La justicia española embarga la cuenta del consulado de Marruecos en Murcia por incumplimiento de sentencia por acoso sexual y laboral]]></title><description><![CDATA[La justicia española ha procedido al embargo de la cuenta bancaria del consulado de Marruecos en Murcia para hacer cumplir una sentencia firme dictada por el Juzgado de lo Social número 1 de esa ciudad. La condena se refiere a un caso de acoso sexual, laboral y moral sufrido por una exempleada del consulado, identificada como Maryam (nombre ficticio), quien era secretaria del entonces cónsul Sidi Mohammed Biedallah. La sentencia declaró nulo el despido de la trabajadora, ordenó su readmisión inmediata y fijó una indemnización superior a 50.000 euros, además del pago de salarios no percibidos desde el despido, con un total estimado que supera los 100.000 euros debido a salarios de tramitación y cotizaciones pendientes.

El acoso se inició en septiembre de 2022 y consistió en insinuaciones, tocamientos, mensajes inapropiados y represalias laborales tras el rechazo de la víctima a las pretensiones del cónsul, lo que afectó gravemente a su salud.

El acero para raíles es uno de los materiales más fiables y regulados, fabricado bajo normas estrictas internacionales que garantizan resistencia a la corrosión, al desgaste y, sobre todo, a las tensiones dinámicas y fatiga provocadas por el paso de trenes a alta velocidad. Los fabricantes cumplen requisitos muy exigentes y los ingenieros aplican amplios márgenes de seguridad, por lo que un fallo catastrófico del material en condiciones normales de servicio es extremadamente improbable.

Según datos recopilados por la base Icasualties, 3.609 militares murieron en acciones de combate durante la intervención, y casi uno de cada tres —1.144 soldados— no pertenecía a Estados Unidos. Estas cifras contradicen abiertamente las afirmaciones del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien llegó a menospreciar el papel de aliados clave como el Reino Unido, insinuando que sus tropas permanecieron alejadas del frente.

Tras las críticas, incluso desde el Gobierno británico, Trump rectificó públicamente, aunque los expertos coinciden en que sus palabras iniciales distorsionan la realidad del conflicto.

En ese altercado, uno de los agentes se apoyó sobre su espalda hasta romperle una costilla, lesión que quedó reflejada en su medicación posterior.

El caso se agrava por la existencia de memorandos internos del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) que instan a recopilar imágenes, matrículas y datos personales de manifestantes para crear bases de datos centralizadas.

La debilidad del dólar, que se encuentra en su peor situación en casi cinco años, es exacerbada por la amenaza de un nuevo cierre del Gobierno en Estados Unidos y la incertidumbre sobre la política económica del país. El presidente Trump, a pesar de la depreciación, ha manifestado su satisfacción con el valor del dólar, aunque sus declaraciones han coincidido con una aceleración de la caída de la divisa. Expertos señalan la inconsistencia de la política estadounidense como un factor clave en la pérdida de confianza de los inversores y la consiguiente presión a la baja sobre el dólar.

Estas embarcaciones, expuestas desde hace años en la Península de la Magdalena, presentan un avanzado estado de deterioro debido a la exposición continuada a las inclemencias meteorológicas y a la falta de un plan de conservación adecuado. Maderas agrietadas, mástiles dañados y paneles informativos ilegibles evidencian una degradación progresiva que ha sido visible para ciudadanos y visitantes sin que las administraciones actuaran con la diligencia necesaria.

El artículo subraya que este problema va más allá de lo técnico o presupuestario y refleja una concepción de la cultura como algo secundario.

Somwanshi, procedente de un entorno rural humilde, había logrado un empleo muy prestigioso en Krutrim, una startup de inteligencia artificial valorada en mil millones de dólares y presentada como la respuesta india a ChatGPT. Sin embargo, tras meses de jornadas de hasta 15 horas diarias, presión constante y aislamiento personal, acabó suicidándose en Bengaluru.

Su caso no es aislado. Informes y testimonios recabados por Rest of World muestran un sector marcado por el agotamiento extremo, el miedo a los despidos y una creciente inseguridad laboral impulsada por la automatización y la inteligencia artificial.

Según testigos presenciales, una pareja de foráneos y varios vecinos acudieron rápidamente en su ayuda y llamaron al 112 Galicia para solicitar una ambulancia. Una enfermera del centro de salud local llegó al lugar y comenzó las maniobras de reanimación cardiopulmonar, manteniendo contacto telefónico constante con el servicio de emergencias 061. Además, otros profesionales sanitarios que se encontraban en la zona, aunque fuera de su horario laboral, se unieron a los esfuerzos, y un médico del centro de salud, que se dirigía a su trabajo, también atendió a la paciente en el lugar.

Históricamente, se le acusó de prácticas monopolísticas, como el caso de Internet Explorer y acuerdos restrictivos con fabricantes, lo que dejó una imagen de corporación controladora. En la actualidad, Windows se percibe como intrusivo debido a la telemetría persistente, integraciones forzadas de Edge, OneDrive y Copilot, publicidad interna, actualizaciones automáticas sin consentimiento y la obligatoriedad de cuentas Microsoft. El escándalo de Windows Recall, que capturaba pantallas automáticamente para crear un historial visual, fue un punto crítico al poner en duda la privacidad, ya que muchos lo vieron como una herramienta de vigilancia excesiva.

Aunque sus capítulos se serializaron previamente en la revista 'Raw', fue la edición en libro la que le otorgó mayor difusión. El cómic presenta el testimonio de Vladek Spiegelman, superviviente del Holocausto nazi, relatado por su hijo Art Spiegelman sin consignas ideológicas ni maniqueísmos, limitándose a mostrar lo vivido durante uno de los periodos más oscuros de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

'Maus' mantiene su vigencia tras décadas gracias a su forma cercana y desgarradora de narrar los hechos. En un contexto actual donde resurgen vientos extremistas y se descuida la memoria histórica, esta obra se presenta como un recordatorio necesario de las consecuencias de los planteamientos totalitarios y supremacistas llevados al extremo.

La obra se articula en dos ejes principales: por un lado, relata la relación extramatrimonial de dos insomnes que solo buscan dormir juntos, mostrando la intimidad más allá de lo sexual; por otro, ofrece un 'diario del sueño' donde se profundiza en los trastornos del descanso y sus implicaciones sociales. Rosa aborda temas como la soledad, la precariedad, la desigualdad y la misoginia, conectando el insomnio con problemas estructurales contemporáneos. Además, introduce fenómenos como el 'sleep tourism', donde personas pudientes buscan hoteles diseñados para optimizar el sueño, evidenciando que incluso el descanso tiene clases. La narrativa combina humor y tragedia cotidiana, reflejando un realismo social que critica la productividad obsesiva y la hipocresía de la vida moderna.

Esto ha generado protestas masivas, denuncias judiciales y un fuerte descenso en la popularidad de las políticas migratorias, con caídas de hasta 11 puntos en encuestas. El presidente relevó al jefe de la Patrulla Fronteriza, Gregory Bovino, reemplazándolo por Tom Homan, su 'zar fronterizo', para intentar calmar la situación y reconducir la estrategia hacia la deportación de criminales convictos, que cuenta con mayor apoyo público.

Argumentó que, sin el respaldo estadounidense, los países europeos tendrían que elevar su gasto en defensa al 10% del PIB —frente al objetivo actual del 5%—, construir su propia capacidad nuclear (con costes de miles de millones de euros) y perderían el 'paraguas nuclear' de EE.UU., que describió como el 'garante último de nuestra libertad'.

Esta posibilidad se plantea tras el archivo de las diligencias por parte de la Fiscalía de la Audiencia Nacional, que concluyó que los tribunales españoles no son competentes para investigar los hechos denunciados.

El letrado del artista ha solicitado formalmente acceso a la denuncia y a las actuaciones practicadas por la Fiscalía con el fin de analizar, con pleno conocimiento de causa, si procede iniciar una querella. Según sostiene, no existe ninguna norma legal que impida al denunciado conocer el contenido de una denuncia presentada contra él, incluso cuando esta haya sido archivada.

Un portavoz de la plataforma ha declarado a NPR que no existe ninguna regla que prohíba mencionar ese nombre y que están analizando las causas técnicas de estos problemas. Las denuncias se producen pocos días después de que las operaciones de TikTok en EE.UU. pasaran a manos de un consorcio mayoritariamente estadounidense, con el algoritmo de recomendaciones licenciado a Oracle, empresa dirigida por Larry Ellison, conocido aliado de Donald Trump.

Según el estudio, una pequeña proporción de grandes terratenientes y agricultores industriales se beneficia desproporcionadamente de las subvenciones, mientras que los pequeños y medianos productores, que constituyen la mayoría, sufren presiones económicas y se ven obligados a cerrar. En España, el 10% de los beneficiarios percibe el 62% del dinero destinado a la PAC, y el 20% superior acumula el 79%. Esta concentración de recursos ha contribuido a la desaparición de numerosas explotaciones agrícolas, especialmente las pequeñas.

Según Rueda, el narcisismo no es una enfermedad mental curable, sino un trastorno de personalidad en el que la persona es consciente de sus actos, pero los considera normales. Explica que los narcisistas suelen mostrarse inicialmente como personas generosas y adaptadas a las necesidades emocionales de sus víctimas, con el objetivo estratégico de controlarlas y absorberlas emocionalmente. Con el tiempo, aíslan a la persona, erosionan su identidad y generan confusión mediante técnicas como la desviación cognitiva o el abuso invisible.

El uso de sistemas de refuerzo variable, donde las recompensas se entregan de forma imprevisible, activa el sistema de recompensa cerebral y genera liberación de dopamina, reforzando la conducta de apostar incluso ante pérdidas continuas. Además, los sesgos cognitivos, como el sesgo de optimismo o la falacia del jugador, llevan a los jugadores a sobreestimar sus posibilidades de éxito y a interpretar los 'casi aciertos' como señales de que pronto ganarán. La ilusión de control, derivada de pequeñas decisiones en el juego que no afectan el azar real, refuerza la sensación de poder y aumenta la persistencia en la actividad.

El decreto rechazado contemplaba no solo la subida de las pensiones conforme al IPC, sino también la prórroga de la suspensión de los desahucios para colectivos vulnerables y otras medidas sociales, como la congelación de las cuotas de los autónomos. La iniciativa fue finalmente tumbada tras el voto negativo de Junts, socio parlamentario del Gobierno, que había advertido previamente de su rechazo al incluirse en el mismo texto medidas antidesahucio. En el vídeo, Sánchez no menciona a Junts, centrando sus críticas exclusivamente en el PP.

Rutte advirtió ante el Parlamento Europeo que la creación de un ejército europeo supondría una duplicación innecesaria de capacidades respecto a la Alianza Atlántica y llegó a afirmar que pensar en una defensa europea autónoma era “seguir soñando”.

Desde Madrid, el ministro de Asuntos Exteriores, José Manuel Albares, defendió que la seguridad es una cuestión central de soberanía y que los europeos deben asumir un mayor control sobre su propio futuro en materia de defensa. Albares subrayó que el objetivo no es convertir a la Unión Europea en una potencia agresiva ni romper con la OTAN o con Estados Unidos, sino garantizar que Europa cuente con capacidades suficientes de disuasión y defensa baj]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-y-francia-defienden-una-mayor-autonomia-estrategica-europea-frente-a-las-criticas-de-la-otan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-y-francia-defienden-una-mayor-autonomia-estrategica-europea-frente-a-las-criticas-de-la-otan</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polémica en 'Letras en Sevilla' por renuncias de ponentes y debate sobre la memoria histórica]]></title><description><![CDATA[El ciclo 'Letras en Sevilla', que se celebra del 2 al 5 de febrero, ha generado un intenso debate en torno a la memoria histórica y la Guerra Civil española. Varias figuras han decidido renunciar a participar, entre ellas el escritor David Uclés, la portavoz del PSOE de Andalucía María Márquez, el coordinador de IU Antonio Maíllo y la investigadora Zira Box. Uclés explicó que no podía compartir cartel con el expresidente José María Aznar y el exdirigente de Vox Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, por considerar que vulneraron derechos fundamentales y como gesto de coherencia con sus valores. Los organizadores, Arturo Pérez Reverte y Jesús Vigorra, calificaron su decisión de sectaria e ignorante, defendiendo que el foro buscaba un debate amplio y ecuánime.

España lidera la producción y exportación de aceite de oliva, representando el 70% de la producción de la Unión Europea y el 45% a nivel mundial. Las últimas cotizaciones indican que los precios del aceite de oliva virgen extra oscilan entre 3,95 y 4,175 euros/kg, mientras que el virgen y el lampante se sitúan entre 3,7 y 3,81 euros/kg y 3,556 y 3,66 euros/kg respectivamente, según Infaoliva, Almazaras Federadas de Córdoba y la Junta de Andalucía. La producción se concentra principalmente en Andalucía, con Jaén como provincia líder, y abarca más de 2,75 millones de hectáreas. La industria del aceite de oliva genera empleo directo e indirecto, movilizando a más de 350.000 agricultores y manteniendo una red de cooperativas y actividades asociadas que vertebran el medio rural.

La advertencia llega de la mano del embajador de EE. UU. en Canadá, Pete Hoekstra, quien ha señalado que una modificación sustancial del contrato obligaría a revisar los términos del histórico acuerdo de defensa conjunta del NORAD, vigente desde la Guerra Fría.

En 2022, el Gobierno canadiense se comprometió a adquirir 88 cazas F-35A para modernizar su flota aérea, con un coste inicial estimado de 19.000 millones de dólares. Sin embargo, una auditoría publicada en 2025 reveló que el precio total del programa se había elevado hasta los 27.700 millones, es decir, unos 8.000 millones más de lo previsto.

A pesar de que algunas personas reconocen que se trata de una broma, la publicación ha engañado a muchos usuarios que creyeron que el actor era un soldado real que contribuyó a la operación.

El problema surgió porque el pensionista había cotizado desde 1970 hasta su jubilación en 2010, y parte de sus aportaciones antiguas no se pudieron deducir en su momento, lo que provocó que tributara dos veces por la misma renta. Hacienda inicialmente aplicó correcciones parciales, pero rechazó la reducción del 25% que Heraclio reclamaba para las aportaciones realizadas hasta 1998, alegando que las posteriores ya tenían beneficios fiscales. Tras agotar la vía administrativa, el tribunal determinó que la normativa del IRPF busca evitar la doble imposición y que, ante la imposibilidad de acreditar la cuantía exacta de las aportaciones antiguas, corresponde aplicar una reducción fija del 25% sobre la parte de la pensión correspondiente.

La historia sigue a cuatro adolescentes —Marcos, José Antonio, Paquito y Toni— que viven un verano lleno de aventuras en bicicleta, mientras crecen en un contexto marcado por la violencia de ETA, la crisis del sida y la proliferación de drogas. La película refleja la dualidad de la época: la inocencia y la alegría de la infancia frente a las dificultades sociales y políticas de los años ochenta.

La temporada sigue la historia de Lucy, Maximus y el Necrófago, personajes que buscan respuestas en un mundo postapocalíptico. Lucy intenta capturar a su padre para llevarlo ante la justicia, mientras Cooper, anteriormente conocido como Necrófago, busca a su esposa e hija, creyendo que se encuentran criogenizadas en uno de los refugios nucleares de Vault-Tec. A pesar de que el cambio a un formato semanal ha ralentizado la serie, Fallout continúa siendo un éxito entre los espectadores, que esperan ansiosos el desenlace de esta temporada. Para recompensar la fidelidad de los fans, Prime Video ha adelantado la disponibilidad de los dos últimos capítulos. En Estados Unidos se emitirán los martes a las 18:00 PT, lo que significa que en España estarán disponibles a partir de las 3:00 de la madrugada del miércoles.

El motivo es un mensaje publicado en redes sociales en el que Quiles pedía al presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, que secuestrara al presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, de forma similar a lo que supuestamente ocurrió con Nicolás Maduro en Venezuela. La denuncia también afectaba inicialmente al torero Fran Rivera por comentarios similares, aunque este último se retractó posteriormente en una intervención televisiva, argumentando que no se refería directamente a Sánchez ni incitaba a una invasión.

El traslado a Elche sugiere que la Fiscalía considera que el presunto delito se cometió desde esa localidad, posiblemente por el lugar desde donde se publicó el mensaje.

Según los datos de la última beta, Meta implementará una opción de pago mensual que permitirá a los usuarios eliminar la publicidad en las secciones de Estados y Canales, sin afectar los chats individuales. Este movimiento responde a la necesidad de rentabilizar la inversión multimillonaria realizada por Facebook al adquirir WhatsApp en 2014, cuya recuperación ha sido limitada. Aunque WhatsApp Business genera ingresos, mantener la infraestructura global de mensajería sigue siendo muy costoso, por lo que la publicidad se ha vuelto inevitable. La nueva propuesta de Meta refleja la estrategia actual de muchas plataformas: los usuarios gratuitos verán anuncios, mientras que quienes paguen podrán disfrutar de la aplicación sin publicidad.

Pretti trabajaba en un hospital de veteranos y era reconocido por su compromiso con los pacientes. Su muerte, ocurrida el 24 de enero durante una operación de control migratorio, ha provocado protestas y críticas hacia la administración de Donald Trump. Los vídeos del incidente, ampliamente difundidos en redes y medios, contradicen las versiones oficiales que afirmaban que Pretti portaba un arma y representaba una amenaza. Kimmel denunció lo que calificó de actos viles y criminales cometidos por ICE y criticó la justificación oficial del uso letal de la fuerza.

Entre los firmantes se encuentran antiguos miembros de la Sala de lo Penal del Supremo, como Alberto Jorge, Perfecto Andrés, Joaquín Giménez y José Antonio Martín Pallín, así como jueces y fiscales en activo, abogados reconocidos y catedráticos de Derecho. El manifiesto denuncia que la sentencia se basa en suposiciones y no en pruebas directas, señalando que el Supremo no tuvo en cuenta los testimonios de periodistas que aseguraron que García Ortiz no era la fuente de la filtración, ignorando así el secreto profesional periodístico.

Las imágenes de Liam, con mochila escolar y gorro azul, se difundieron rápidamente y se convirtieron en símbolo del endurecimiento de la política migratoria. Según datos del Deportation Data Project, entre enero y octubre de 2025 el ICE detuvo a unos 3.800 menores junto a sus padres, más de 2.600 de ellos dentro del país, lo que supone un cambio respecto a prácticas anteriores centradas en la frontera.

La decisión ha sido comunicada oficialmente al Ministerio de Sanidad por el Comité Regional Europeo de Verificación para la Eliminación del Sarampión y la Rubeola, tras analizar los datos epidemiológicos y de laboratorio correspondientes a 2024.

España había logrado este reconocimiento en 2016, después de más de tres años sin transmisión endémica del virus. Sin embargo, el incremento sostenido de contagios en los últimos años ha revertido esta situación. En 2023 se notificaron 11 casos, cifra que ascendió a 227 en 2024 y que continuó creciendo hasta alcanzar los 397 casos en 2025.

El trabajo se ha centrado en el adenocarcinoma ductal de páncreas, el tipo más frecuente de este cáncer y uno de los más resistentes a los tratamientos actuales. La principal dificultad de esta enfermedad radica en su diagnóstico tardío y en la escasa eficacia de las terapias disponibles, lo que explica sus bajas tasas de supervivencia.

Portman acudió al festival luciendo en la solapa de su abrigo una chapa con el lema “ICE out”, un gesto simbólico con el que expresó su rechazo a las políticas migratorias del Ejecutivo estadounidense.

Según el autor, la reacción contra el humorista no nace de una ofensa real, sino de una mentira repetida de forma masiva: que se había burlado de las víctimas de un accidente ferroviario. En realidad, sostiene Tecé, la sátira iba dirigida al periodismo sensacionalista que explota el dolor ajeno para ganar audiencia.

El texto describe cómo esta falsedad fue amplificada en redes sociales por sectores de ultraderecha, que pasaron rápidamente de la supuesta indignación moral a la celebración explícita de la retirada del cómico.

El juez Antonio Piña, tras recibir una denuncia de la Asociación Libertad y Justicia por presuntos delitos de homicidio imprudente, ha decidido consultar previamente a la Fiscalía si este tribunal es competente para investigar los hechos.

La cuestión de la competencia es clave, ya que Puente, en su condición de ministro, es aforado. Esto implica que, en caso de apreciarse indicios penales, la causa debería ser asumida por el Tribunal Supremo y no por la Audiencia Nacional. No obstante, el auto judicial señala que los hechos descritos en la denuncia presentan características que permiten presumir la posible existencia de una infracción penal, lo que abre la puerta a una investigación más profunda.

Este descenso histórico se debe a varios factores, como la falta de inversión pública y privada, el impacto de la crisis financiera de 2008 y la desaparición de entidades financieras y promotoras que antes impulsaban la construcción de VPO. Solo un 21% de las viviendas protegidas recientes se construyen directamente con participación pública, mientras que el resto depende de promotores privados. La inversión por habitante en vivienda protegida en España es de apenas 80 euros al año, muy inferior a la media europea de 72 euros y a regiones como País Vasco o Navarra, que destinan 450 euros por persona. Aunque España dispone de suelo suficiente para construir más viviendas, la burocracia y los largos plazos para urbanizarlo ralentizan la construcción, demorando proyectos hasta 10-20 años.

Sin embargo, algunos sectores políticos y cuentas en redes sociales han difundido falsamente que esta medida busca favorecer electoralmente al presidente Pedro Sánchez. Esto es incorrecto, ya que la regularización no concede la nacionalidad española, requisito imprescindible para votar en elecciones generales. Para obtener la nacionalidad por residencia, normalmente se exige una estancia legal y continua de diez años, con algunas excepciones como refugiados. Sí existe la posibilidad de voto para extranjeros en elecciones municipales bajo ciertos tratados y para ciudadanos de la UE residentes en España, pero nunca para personas en situación irregular.

Sin embargo, la Fuerza Aérea de Estados Unidos (USAF) vio en la cápsula Gemini una oportunidad para fines militares. En 1962 surgió Blue Gemini, un proyecto para realizar hasta seis misiones orbitales con la nave Gemini adaptada, con el fin de adquirir experiencia en órbita baja de cara a la estación espacial militar MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), que más tarde evolucionaría hacia el MOL (Manned Orbiting Laboratory) con un telescopio espía KH-10 DORIAN.

Blue Gemini incluía acoplamientos con etapas Agena, pruebas de unidades de maniobra extravehicular AMU y posibles misiones de reconocimiento de satélites enemigos o despliegue de estructuras. Algunas misiones contarían con un solo astronauta para llevar más equipo (hasta 91 kg extra).

Según explica, ella y un amigo siguieron durante unos segundos a vehículos sin identificar del ICE, tocando el claxon y usando silbatos para advertir de la presencia de los agentes, una forma de observación comunitaria que consideran amparada por la ley.

La respuesta fue, según su testimonio, desproporcionada y violenta: los agentes rodearon su coche, rociaron gas pimienta en el interior sin previo aviso, rompieron las ventanillas, los sacaron a la fuerza y los arrestaron. O’Keefe describe insultos, burlas y comentarios homófobos por parte de los agentes durante el traslado, así como la negación de derechos básicos como realizar una llamada telefónica o acceder a agua y servicios higiénicos en condiciones dignas.

Como ejemplo principal destaca la miniserie 'The Savant', producida y protagonizada por Jessica Chastain, cuya fecha de estreno prevista para el 26 de septiembre de 2025 en Apple TV+ fue pospuesta indefinidamente tras el asesinato del activista ultraderechista Charlie Kirk el 10 de septiembre de ese mes. La serie, basada en un reportaje de Cosmopolitan, narra el trabajo de investigadores que identifican posibles terroristas domésticos en foros y redes de ultraderecha. A pesar de que Chastain defendió mantener el estreno, Apple optó por retrasarlo argumentando una 'reflexión detenida', lo que el autor interpreta como miedo a críticas del entorno republicano.

Esta medida busca alinearse con las recomendaciones del Comité de los Derechos del Niño de la ONU, que desde 2018 y recientemente en 2026 ha instado a España a impedir la exposición de niños a estos espectáculos para prevenir efectos nocivos, como la desensibilización ante el sufrimiento, la normalización de la violencia como entretenimiento y su impacto en el desarrollo de la empatía y la resolución de conflictos.

La preocupación internacional se centra en las políticas migratorias restrictivas de Trump, que incluyen prohibiciones de entrada para ciudadanos de varios países clasificados para el torneo, como Senegal, Costa de Marfil, Irán y Haití, afectando así la posibilidad de que los seguidores viajen para apoyar a sus selecciones.

Sin embargo, el artículo critica duramente la medida al argumentar que, debido al carácter progresivo del IRPF, una rebaja uniforme en todos los tramos genera un ahorro mucho mayor en términos absolutos para las rentas altas, ya que estas tributan en los tramos superiores y se benefician de la reducción en toda la 'escalera' impositiva.

La salida se produce sin que el país haya cumplido con sus obligaciones financieras, dejando impagos al menos 278 millones de dólares en cuotas correspondientes al periodo presupuestario 2024–2025, además de una cantidad indeterminada de fondos voluntarios prometidos.

Aunque el aviso formal de retirada se comunicó hace un año, la desvinculación práctica fue inmediata: la administración Trump cortó relaciones con la OMS desde el primer momento, justificando la decisión por su gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19, el sistema de cuotas y lo que considera un trato indulgente hacia China. A diferencia de su primer intento de salida durante el anterior mandato, que fue revocado por la administración Biden, esta vez el proceso ha culminado sin marcha atrás.

Los países participantes —Alemania, Bélgica, Dinamarca, Francia, Irlanda, Luxemburgo, Noruega, Países Bajos y Reino Unido— se comprometieron a crear una 'flota sin precedentes' de proyectos conjuntos de eólica offshore con una capacidad total de 100 GW, equivalente al consumo eléctrico de aproximadamente 100 millones de hogares. Aunque no se especificó un calendario concreto para este objetivo inicial, el pacto retoma metas anteriores más ambiciosas, como alcanzar 120 GW para 2030 y hasta 300 GW para 2050. El principal objetivo es fortalecer la independencia energética de Europa, especialmente tras la invasión rusa de Ucrania en 2022, que provocó una ruptura con el suministro de gas ruso y generó crisis de precios e inflación.

Esta cifra incluye variantes como la J-20A y la biplaza J-20S. La producción anual ha alcanzado aproximadamente 120 aviones, pasando de unos 50 en 2020 a cerca de 300 a mediados de 2025. Este despliegue masivo, concentrado en una sola fuerza aérea, representa un cambio significativo en el equilibrio de poder aéreo en el Indopacífico, desafiando la superioridad tradicional de Estados Unidos, especialmente en escenarios como Taiwán y el Mar de la China Meridional.

Entre 2014 y 2025, el hospital utilizó este procedimiento excepcional para adquirir miles de sensores desechables necesarios para la monitorización de pacientes en quirófanos, reanimación y cuidados intensivos, alegando la necesidad de evitar la interrupción de un servicio esencial.

La situación salió a la luz tras la actuación de Óscar Hernández, activista por la transparencia, que detectó un uso masivo y continuado de contratos menores con el mismo proveedor.

Este hongo, popular por su sabor umami y consumido en mercados y restaurantes durante la temporada de junio a agosto, provoca alucinaciones muy específicas: visiones de figuras diminutas, como duendes o humanos pequeños, que se mueven por las paredes, trepan por los muebles o pasan bajo las puertas. Estas 'alucinaciones liliputienses', término psiquiátrico inspirado en Los viajes de Gulliver, son sorprendentemente consistentes entre los afectados y pueden durar entre 12 y 24 horas, llegando incluso a requerir hospitalización prolongada.

El investigador Colin Domnauer, de la Universidad de Utah, ha estudiado esta especie durante años.

El objetivo principal de esta estrategia represiva, sostiene, es desmovilizar: los elevados costes económicos de multas, abogados y procesos judiciales, junto con el desgaste psicológico —ansiedad, depresión, insomnio—, empujan a muchas personas a abandonar la militancia.

El autor, que fue diputado durante los gobiernos de Mariano Rajoy, afirma haber registrado cientos de preguntas parlamentarias que revelaron un periodo de recortes y abandono en el ferrocarril entre 2011 y 2017.

Este dato, publicado por la Encuesta de Población Activa (EPA), viene acompañado además de un récord histórico de empleo, con 22,46 millones de personas ocupadas tras la creación de más de 605.000 puestos de trabajo a lo largo del año.

Aunque la reducción del número de personas desempleadas fue relativamente moderada —algo menos de 120.000—, este comportamiento se explica por el fuerte aumento de la población activa, que rozó los 25 millones de personas. El mercado laboral español no solo es hoy más grande que nunca, sino que también muestra una evolución más estable que en ciclos anteriores, alejándose de las cifras extremas de desempleo que se alcanzaron en 2013, cuando el paro llegó a rozar el 27%.

En diversos vídeos compartidos en redes sociales, muestra con transparencia su rutina diaria, incluyendo aspectos como la preparación de comidas sencillas con productos de marca blanca, y responde a las críticas que recibe por supuestamente normalizar la pobreza o romantizar la precariedad laboral. Él mismo reconoce que cobra una cantidad baja —una 'miseria', en sus palabras—, similar a la de muchos jóvenes en el país, pero defiende su elección como positiva y liberadora. A pesar de las dificultades económicas y la exposición pública que genera críticas recurrentes, afirma que esta vida le resulta satisfactoria y valiosa, llegando a describirla como 'de millonario' en comparación con una existencia convencional que no desea.

El estudio pone el foco especialmente en los barrios de Orba y Alfalares, donde los daños visibles en calles, parques e infraestructuras básicas actúan como recordatorios constantes del trauma vivido.

Los datos son contundentes: en los siete meses posteriores a la catástrofe se registraron 932 atenciones psicosociales, con un incremento superior al 620 % respecto a los niveles habituales previos a la emergencia. El pico de intervenciones se alcanzó en marzo de 2025, coincidiendo con la falta de avances visibles en la rehabilitación del entorno urbano.

Esta represión no solo busca silenciar las protestas y limitar la organización social, sino también agotar económicamente y psicológicamente a los activistas, llevándolos a abandonar la militancia. Gari describe cómo la policía acusa a los manifestantes de agresiones, incluso cuando ellos son quienes sufren la violencia policial, y cómo los juicios están teniendo consecuencias devastadoras, desde multas elevadas hasta la pérdida de permisos de residencia. Se están produciendo juicios por eslóganes considerados “apología del terrorismo”, como “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”, que se utiliza para disolver manifestaciones.

En una entrevista con New York Magazine, Trump relató que durante estas sesiones, que pueden durar varias horas, necesita reclinarse y mover la mano para que los presentes vean que está prestando atención. A pesar de estos gestos, defiende que sigue cada palabra y que su atención es completa. Este debate sobre su comportamiento llega en un contexto de creciente atención sobre su salud, debido a moretones en las manos y episodios en los que se le ha visto dormitar en eventos públicos.

Los problemas comenzaron la semana pasada, con incidencias que afectaron gravemente la circulación de trenes y se agravaron con un fallo en el centro de control de tráfico. El Govern de Salvador Illa, presionado por sus socios de legislatura y la oposición, exigió responsabilidades a las empresas públicas, lo que precipitó estas decisiones. García Alemany llevaba apenas 10 meses en el cargo y había asumido la dirección tras su paso por la EMT de València.

Desde sus años de estudiante en la Escuela Politécnica de Zúrich, Einstein comenzó a navegar en los lagos alpinos, desarrollando una gran habilidad para interpretar los cambios meteorológicos, a pesar de que nunca aprendió a nadar. Una anécdota vivida junto a Marie Curie en el lago Lemán ilustra tanto su sangre fría como el carácter imprevisible de esas aguas.

La vela se convirtió para Einstein en una vía de evasión y concentración. Pasó cientos de horas navegando en solitario, utilizando esos momentos de calma para reflexionar y anotar ideas, convencido de que la simplicidad del manejo de un velero le permitía liberar la mente. En 1929, con motivo de su cincuenta cumpleaños, sus amigos le regalaron el Tümmler, un pequeño velero diseñado por Adolf Harms y construido en un astillero alemán.

El autor sostiene que los informes jurídicos y de intervención han pasado de acompañar la decisión a sustituirla, en un contexto institucional marcado por el control ex post, la personalización de la responsabilidad y el miedo al reproche posterior. Esto genera decisiones defensivas, retrasos y pérdida de oportunidades.

El texto subraya que los informes se solicitan habitualmente tarde, cuando las alternativas ya están cerradas, y se formulan como si el Derecho ofreciera una única solución posible. Esta ficción de univocidad oculta la pluralidad real de opciones que suelen existir en el Derecho administrativo, caracterizado por normas abiertas, conceptos jurídicos indeterminados y márgenes de discrecionalidad.

Johnson, de 44 años, fue arrestado en julio de 2025 y está acusado de abusar de una víctima durante varios meses a partir de 2024.

Tras los hechos del 6 de enero, Johnson se declaró culpable de cuatro cargos federales relacionados con el asalto y fue condenado a un año de prisión en 2024, pena que quedó anulada con el indulto de Trump.

Ejemplos como el vídeo viral de Tedesco usando botellas para 'corregir' a Asensio, o las actitudes exhibicionistas de entrenadores como Arteta con altavoces o Amorim defendiendo su idea hasta el ridículo pese a malos resultados, ilustran este 'frikismo': una banalización que simplifica un deporte complejo y lo convierte en performance mediática.

Según el diplomático, durante la denominada Operación Resolución Absoluta, muchos miembros de los cuerpos de seguridad 'no hicieron todo lo que podían' para detener el avance de las fuerzas extranjeras. Además, afirmó que Rusia conoce los nombres de los 'traidores' que huyeron del país y que habían trabajado sistemáticamente para la inteligencia estadounidense mucho antes de la operación.

Este incidente se produce en un contexto de creciente tensión nacional, exacerbada por la muerte de Alex Pretti, un enfermero de 37 años, durante una operación de inmigración en Minneapolis. Las protestas y vigilias en memoria de Pretti, junto con las demandas de investigación y la retirada de agentes federales de la ciudad, han obligado a las autoridades locales a desplegar a la Guardia Nacional.

La iniciativa cuenta con el respaldo del Gobierno y del presidente Emmanuel Macron, y se ha aprobado con 116 votos a favor y 23 en contra, tras un procedimiento de urgencia que pretende aplicarse desde el próximo curso escolar. Si se aprueba definitivamente, Francia se convertiría en el segundo país del mundo, tras Australia, en establecer una restricción de este tipo. El proyecto de ley incluye solo dos artículos que establecen normativas claras sobre el uso del móvil y las redes sociales para menores. Será el Ejecutivo quien determine, mediante decreto y basándose en informes de la Autoridad de Regulación de la Comunicación Audiovisual y Digital (ARCOM), qué redes se consideran peligrosas para los menores.

Partiendo de informes de Europa Laica, el texto sostiene que la Iglesia maneja enormes volúmenes de ingresos y gastos con un alto grado de opacidad y que recibe del Estado más de 11.000 millones de euros anuales mediante subvenciones directas, exenciones fiscales y otros beneficios económicos. Esta situación es descrita como un auténtico paraíso fiscal, incompatible con el principio de igualdad ante la ley.

El autor recuerda que la Constitución de 1978 establece que ninguna confesión tendrá carácter estatal, pero subraya que, más de cuatro décadas después, la Iglesia católica mantiene un poder económico muy superior al de otras entidades, además de una posición privilegiada difícil de cuantificar. Se critica especialmente la financiación vía impuesto sobre la renta, que aporta cerca de 250 millones de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-financiacion-y-los-privilegios-economicos-de-la-iglesia-catolica-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-financiacion-y-los-privilegios-economicos-de-la-iglesia-catolica-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Policía identifica a varios jóvenes por actos vandálicos y riesgos para la seguridad en el centro de Pedreguer]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Local de Pedreguer ha identificado a seis o siete jóvenes, de entre 18 y 19 años, como autores de una serie de actos vandálicos ocurridos durante la noche en el centro del municipio. Los hechos se produjeron en un contexto festivo y, según relatan fuentes municipales, estuvieron marcados por una combinación de exaltación patriótica y consumo de alcohol.

Los jóvenes arrancaron y arrastraron una barrera utilizada en los festejos taurinos de Sant Blai hasta la fachada del ayuntamiento, donde la emplearon para trepar y acceder de forma ilegítima al balcón municipal. Desde allí profirieron gritos de 'viva España' y sustrajeron la bandera de Palestina que ondeaba en el edificio consistorial, con la que posteriormente se pasearon por la localidad.

Además de estos hechos simbólicos, los implicados retiraron uno de los bolardos que regulan el tráfico en la plaza, lo que supuso un riesgo para la seguridad vial.

Según su metodología, basada en cinco indicadores financieros y administrativos, el 42% de los locales estudiados presentaría indicios compatibles con prácticas de blanqueo de capitales.

Los criterios utilizados incluyen la declaración de volúmenes de negocio sobredimensionados, márgenes brutos anormalmente bajos, la gestión de varias sociedades por una misma persona en sectores considerados de riesgo, cambios frecuentes de encargado y una facturación inferior al volumen de compras.

Acusa a El Mundo de publicar historias sin contrastar cuando se trata de figuras como Isabel Díaz Ayuso o el expresidente Aznar, pero de no dar oportunidad de desmentido a gobiernos de signo contrario. Puente califica esto no como periodismo, sino como matonismo y parte del 'lawfare' actual.

El texto destaca la recomendación a los usuarios de Menéame de ser críticos con los medios enlazados, considerando a El Mundo más como propaganda que como fuente de información fiable. Se insta a no llenar la plataforma con bulos.

Los simpatizantes gritaron consignas como 'Todos somos Unidad 100', en referencia a la unidad militar a la que pertenecen los acusados. El vídeo filtrado del incidente muestra a varios soldados golpeando y, presuntamente, violando en grupo al detenido tras escudarse con escudos antidisturbios, lo que provocó graves lesiones internas y rectales en la víctima, quien requirió múltiples cirugías.

La obra fue realizada por el pintor ucraniano de origen judío Isaac Brodsky, destacado representante del realismo socialista, quien fue nombrado director de la Academia Panrusa de las Artes en 1934 y recibió la Orden de Lenin ese mismo año. Brodsky, conocido por sus retratos de Lenin y obras históricas, fue encargado de representar la inauguración del congreso en el Palacio Uritski de Petrogrado.

En el mapa de avisos destaca que prácticamente todas las comunidades presentan algún nivel de alerta, con la excepción parcial de Aragón durante la jornada del martes.

La situación más preocupante se da en Galicia, donde la Aemet ha activado el aviso rojo por precipitaciones muy intensas que podrían dejar acumulados significativos. A estas lluvias se suma el riesgo añadido del deshielo debido a las temperaturas suaves, lo que incrementa la probabilidad de crecidas en ríos y zonas inundables.

El estudio analiza el periodo comprendido entre 2003 y 2022 y se centra específicamente en la evasión fiscal de los contribuyentes, es decir, en la ocultación parcial de ingresos legales, sin incluir la economía sumergida asociada a actividades ilegales como el tráfico de drogas.

Para calcular la denominada brecha fiscal, Fedea compara las rentas declaradas en el IRPF con las cifras de la contabilidad regional. Los resultados muestran que el grado de cumplimiento fiscal ha oscilado entre el 72,2% registrado en 2005 y el 86% alcanzado en 2020.

Los resultados indican que las mujeres tienden a encontrar más atractivas a los hombres con una estatura mayor, una relación hombros-cadera más amplia y un pene relativamente más grande, aunque estos atributos ejercen un efecto decreciente al llegar a extremos.

Tras los asesinatos de Alex Pretti en Minnesota y Renee Good, Bovino afirmó que aquellos que se refieran a los agentes federales como 'secuestradores' o 'Gestapo' enfrentarán 'consecuencias'. Este comentario ha sido interpretado por analistas y especialistas en derechos civiles como una amenaza directa a la libertad de expresión. Bovino, vinculado estrechamente con la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional Kristi Noem, se ha convertido en un rostro visible de las operaciones antiinmigrantes, destacando especialmente tras las redadas en Los Ángeles el año pasado. Su uniforme y estilo, que recuerda a la Gestapo nazi, han intensificado las críticas a nivel nacional e internacional.

Se trata del tercer hueso del carpo de la pata delantera derecha de un elefante, lo que constituye una evidencia física muy rara en Europa sobre el uso de estos animales en conflictos bélicos de la Antigüedad. Junto al hueso se encontraron doce esferas de piedra, propias de catapultas de torsión (lithoboloi o petroboloi), una punta de flecha pesada y una moneda cartaginesa del tipo 'Casco', elementos que apuntan a un episodio militar en la ciudad ibera de Corduba. La investigación sugiere que el hallazgo podría estar relacionado con escaramuzas o asedios durante la invasión cartaginesa liderada por Amílcar Barca y sus sucesores. La ausencia de otros restos óseos podría deberse a dispersión natural o a que el hueso se conservó como trofeo aislado.

Esta declaración ha sido recibida con fuertes críticas por parte de la oposición, activistas gitanos y el alcalde de Budapest, quienes la consideran una humillación y una clara muestra de discriminación.

Las declaraciones se producen en un momento de distensión parcial entre Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea, después de que el presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, anunciara la retirada de aranceles a sus aliados europeos y avanzara un principio de acuerdo con la OTAN en relación con el futuro de Groenlandia.

Este gen desempeña un papel clave en la producción del olor axilar, ya que codifica una proteína implicada en la liberación de lípidos a través de las glándulas sudoríparas apocrinas, localizadas principalmente en las axilas y la entrepierna.

El olor corporal humano no procede directamente del sudor, sino de la acción de las bacterias de la piel, que descomponen estas sustancias grasas y generan compuestos volátiles responsables del olor característico.

Esta actualización responde al incremento retributivo aplicado a los portavoces de los grupos parlamentarios del Parlamento andaluz, que a su vez se ajusta al Real Decreto-ley 14/2025 de ámbito nacional, con un 2,5 % en 2025 (respecto a 2024) y un 1,5 % en 2026 (respecto a 2025). La normativa autonómica (Decreto-ley 11/2023) fija el sueldo del presidente con una minoración del 5 % respecto a dichos portavoces, por lo que la subida se traslada automáticamente a altos cargos de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-andaluz-aprueba-una-nueva-subida-salarial-para-moreno-bonilla-y-altos-cargos-que-cobraran-92-208-84-euros-en-2026</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-andaluz-aprueba-una-nueva-subida-salarial-para-moreno-bonilla-y-altos-cargos-que-cobraran-92-208-84-euros-en-2026</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Héctor de Miguel se toma un parón tras su parodia a Nacho Abad y recibe apoyo de compañeros y seguidores]]></title><description><![CDATA[Héctor de Miguel, presentador y humorista, anunció un parón indefinido tras realizar una parodia crítica sobre Nacho Abad y su cobertura del accidente ferroviario de Adamuz. En su comunicado, Héctor explicó que necesitaba descansar y pidió disculpas a quienes pudieran haberse sentido molestos, aclarando que su intención era hacer comedia basada en la cobertura mediática de la tragedia, no faltar al respeto a las víctimas. La reacción en redes ha sido mayoritariamente de apoyo, con periodistas, humoristas y usuarios mostrando comprensión y solidaridad hacia su decisión.

El texto se abre con el testimonio de Abdallah, un médico gazatí que perdió a casi toda su familia en un ataque aéreo israelí, un relato que sirve para poner rostro humano al sufrimiento colectivo y al impacto psicológico del conflicto.

Albanese sostiene que el mundo ha entrado en una nueva fase del genocidio en Gaza, menos visible mediáticamente pero no menos violenta, favorecida por la muerte de periodistas y la normalización internacional de la tragedia. A su juicio, esta indiferencia recuerda a otros genocidios históricos, incluidos los ocurridos en Europa, y cuestiona directamente a la sociedad israelí por tolerar o incluso celebrar abusos graves contra la población palestina.

A partir del personaje de Perfectus Detritus, antagonista del álbum ‘La cizaña’, el autor reflexiona sobre la figura del agitador profesional: alguien capaz de envenenar cualquier conversación, generar discordia y dinamitar proyectos colectivos mediante la mentira, la manipulación y la confrontación constante. Francino recuerda cómo los cómics de Astérix han sabido retratar, con humor costumbrista, los estereotipos y vicios humanos en distintos pueblos y épocas, creando personajes secundarios memorables que encarnan defectos universales.

En ese marco simbólico, el autor establece un paralelismo entre Perfectus Detritus y determinadas figuras de la política española actual. Aunque menciona de pasada a Alejo Vidal-Quadras por un cierto parecido físico, el foco principal recae en Isabel Díaz Ayuso, a quien considera el ejemplo más acabado del perfil]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/perfectus-detritus-como-metafora-politica-una-critica-a-isabel-diaz-ayuso-desde-asterix</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/perfectus-detritus-como-metafora-politica-una-critica-a-isabel-diaz-ayuso-desde-asterix</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Evolución del acceso a la vivienda en España: cómo han cambiado los precios y las condiciones de compra]]></title><description><![CDATA[La idea de que “antes se podía comprar una casa con un solo salario y pagarla en diez años” es un mito simplificado que no refleja la realidad histórica del mercado de la vivienda en España. Entre 1955 y 2001 coexistieron distintos modelos: el desarrollismo franquista, el periodo regulado postfranquista y el preburbuja. Durante el franquismo, las viviendas protegidas eran accesibles gracias a subvenciones estatales, precios fijados políticamente y trabajo obligatorio del futuro propietario, mientras que la vivienda libre estaba fuera del alcance de la mayoría. En la transición democrática, la vivienda protegida continuó siendo un pilar, pero los créditos seguían siendo caros, limitando la capacidad de compra. Ya en los años noventa, la caída de los tipos de interés y la consolidación del hogar de doble salario transformaron el mercado: la vivienda pasó a depender del crédito y no del salario familiar, lo que disparó la capacidad de endeudamiento y abrió el camino a la burbuja inmobilia]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evolucion-del-acceso-a-la-vivienda-en-espana-como-han-cambiado-los-precios-y-las-condiciones-de-compra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evolucion-del-acceso-a-la-vivienda-en-espana-como-han-cambiado-los-precios-y-las-condiciones-de-compra</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Factores que favorecen el auge de la extrema derecha en España y Cataluña]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza cómo ciertos fenómenos sociales y políticos pueden empujar a ciudadanos hacia posturas de extrema derecha.

El autor se basa en el libro 'El Fascismo eterno' de Umberto Eco para explicar que, aunque los fachas cambian con el tiempo, siguen un patrón similar. Primero, se fomenta la confusión mediante la saturación de información y mensajes contradictorios, lo que provoca miedo y desorientación. En respuesta al miedo, la extrema derecha apela a la tradición, el culto al pasado y la creación de un líder fuerte y carismático que encarne los valores de un pueblo 'elegido'.

La hermana de la joven declaró que ésta no estaba retenida y que podía salir de la casa. Los acusados, de origen paquistaní, defendieron que su intención era ayudar a la joven mediante la lectura de suras del Corán y negaron cualquier uso de violencia.

Japón, con una deuda en circulación superior a siete billones de dólares, ha sido durante años un referente para estrategias de inversión conocidas como carry trade, donde fondos internacionales tomaban prestados yenes para invertir en activos extranjeros. La venta masiva de deuda y la fuerte apreciación del yen han puesto fin a esta estabilidad y llevado al Gobierno japonés a anunciar posibles intervenciones coordinadas con Estados Unidos para frenar movimientos especulativos.

Según Puente, incluso si se hubiera auscultado la vía un día antes, no se habría detectado ninguna anomalía relevante. El ministro destacó que no se refería a sabotaje, aunque esta hipótesis no se descarta formalmente, pero no es la más plausible ni prioritaria actualmente.

El accidente se produjo por la ruptura de un tramo del carril nuevo, instalado en mayo de 2025, cerca de la soldadura con el carril antiguo. Los expertos explican que cuando el carril se rompe lo suficiente, los bogies del tren quedan suspendidos y el peso del tren provoca que el raíl se tumbe. Puente aclaró que la causa exacta aún se desconoce y que será necesario examinar tanto el raíl como la soldadura en laboratorio para determinar si la ruptura se debió a un defecto de la soldadura o a la torsión del raíl.

Cartones, plásticos y tiendas de campaña se han convertido en hogares improvisados para cientos de personas.

La falta de datos públicos dificulta conocer cuántas personas viven en estas condiciones, aunque los Equipos de Calle del Ayuntamiento detectaron a finales de 2025 más de mil personas sin hogar, concentradas sobre todo en los distritos de Centro, Arganzuela y Barajas.

Foege es reconocido principalmente por desarrollar en la década de 1960, mientras trabajaba como médico misionero en Nigeria, la estrategia de 'contención en anillo'. Esta técnica consistía en identificar rápidamente los casos de viruela y vacunar de forma inmediata a los contactos cercanos del enfermo, en lugar de optar por vacunaciones masivas, lo que resultó clave ante la escasez de dosis. Gracias a este enfoque eficiente y basado en datos, junto con el programa global de la OMS, se logró el último caso natural de viruela en Somalia en 1977, y la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró la erradicación oficial de la enfermedad en 1980. Se trata de la única enfermedad humana eliminada por completo mediante esfuerzos coordinados de salud pública, s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-william-foege-clave-en-la-erradicacion-mundial-de-la-viruela-a-los-89-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-william-foege-clave-en-la-erradicacion-mundial-de-la-viruela-a-los-89-anos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Con permiso de la reina: un recorrido por la evolución del humor británico]]></title><description><![CDATA[El periodista y escritor Jorge San Román publica 'Con permiso de la reina. El humor inglés. De los bufones a la Sitcom', un libro que analiza la historia y las características del humor británico. Desde los bufones medievales hasta las sitcoms de los años 70 y el impacto internacional de figuras como los Monty Python, Mr. Bean, Benny Hill o los Roper, San Román examina cómo este humor se ha definido por su sofisticación, ironía y a veces crudeza. El libro repasa la evolución de la comedia inglesa a través de distintos formatos culturales: la literatura, la prensa humorística, los cómics, el cine, el music hall, la radio y la televisión. Se destacan anécdotas curiosas y aspectos poco conocidos, como la influencia de la época de los Swinging Sixties en la creatividad de los Monty Python o la controversia actual sobre figuras como Benny Hill. Además, se subraya la repercusión de la comedia británica en la cultura mundial y su influencia en actores y directores de Hollywood.

La historia parte de un anuncio absurdo pero verosímil: el presidente proclama la conquista de Groenlandia sin que nadie se atreva a llevarle la contraria. Ante la imposibilidad económica de sostener una guerra real —ni siquiera de alquilar Disneylandia como escenografía—, sus asesores optan por una solución precaria y simbólica: montar una falsa victoria con nieve artificial, vallas improvisadas y un decorado cutre al que bautizan como “Presidentland”.

Ambos compartieron orígenes humildes y la pasión inicial por la bicicleta, además de un amigo común, Biagio Cavanna, masajista de Girardengo y quien más tarde descubriría a Fausto Coppi. Girardengo destacó por su resistencia y palmarés impresionante: múltiples victorias en el Giro de Italia (incluyendo liderar de principio a fin en 1919), nueve campeonatos de Italia consecutivos, Milán-San Remo y el Gran Premio Wolber. Sobrevivió a la gripe española y a caídas graves, y se convirtió en un ícono comercial del ciclismo.

Es necesario demostrar que algún cargo de Adif o del Ministerio de Transportes disponía de información concreta sobre el problema existente, tenía la capacidad de resolverlo y, de forma negligente, omitió actuar.

El juez subrayó que el caso pone de manifiesto un problema estructural en la gestión del sistema ferroviario español.

La compañía alemana vendió cerca de 247.900 turismos eléctricos, lo que representa un aumento del 49,1% respecto al año anterior, mientras que Tesla descendió de más de 300.000 unidades en 2024 a poco más de 200.000 en 2025. La caída de Tesla se atribuye a varios factores, como la competencia de fabricantes chinos con precios más asequibles, el fortalecimiento de otras marcas europeas gracias a ayudas estatales, y decisiones controvertidas de su CEO. Dentro del Grupo Volkswagen, Audi vendió 223.000 unidades (+8%), Skoda 174.900 (+120%) y Cupra 79.900 (+66%). Modelos como el ID.4 y el ID.7 lideraron las matriculaciones de la marca. Este ascenso de Volkswagen refleja una consolidación de la industria europea en la electrificación del transporte, mostrando que la hegemonía de Tesla en Europa ya no es indiscutible.

La justicia española no investigó de manera efectiva las denuncias de violación mediante drogas, a pesar de que las víctimas presentaban evidencias de lesiones físicas y mensajes de los presuntos agresores que indicaban intenciones violentas. La jueza de instrucción, Inés Hualde, aunque reconoció la falta de consentimiento y los daños sufridos por las mujeres, decidió no procesar a los acusados alegando ausencia de violencia o intimidación. Además, la Fiscalía no tomó medidas ni solicitó diligencias significativas. La Audiencia Provincial inicialmente respaldó la instrucción, pero seis años después archivó la causa.

Según el texto, la intervención se justifica oficialmente por la detección de supuestas irregularidades financieras y desvío de fondos públicos en la gestión del muelle. Sin embargo, desde la oposición y desde el gobierno provincial de Tierra del Fuego se denuncia que la verdadera motivación estaría ligada a un presunto acuerdo con el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump.

De acuerdo con estas versiones, Milei habría ofrecido el uso militar y comercial del puerto de Ushuaia a Estados Unidos como parte de una negociación para evitar el pago de mil millones de dólares exigidos para obtener una membresía permanente en una supuesta junta de paz sobre Gaza impulsada por Washington.

La acusación se basa en un pódcast en el que Varoufakis narró una experiencia juvenil en la que consumió una pastilla, advertía explícitamente sobre los riesgos de la adicción y desaconsejaba su consumo. El político critica que la investigación, iniciada por un fiscal, constituye un intento de desacreditarlo por sus posturas políticas, especialmente sus críticas al Estado de Israel y su calificación de genocidio respecto a la Franja de Gaza. Varoufakis ha señalado que estos ataques muestran cómo fuerzas ultracapitalistas buscan castigar a quienes no se alinean con sus intereses, utilizando calumnias y censura.

Según Trump, las políticas de las denominadas 'ciudades santuario' y la falta de cooperación de gobiernos locales demócratas habrían creado un entorno peligroso que propició estos incidentes. En sus declaraciones en Truth Social y en una entrevista con The Wall Street Journal, Trump defendió la actuación de los agentes y criticó a las víctimas, describiendo a uno de ellos como portador de un arma peligrosa. Paralelamente, ha pedido al Congreso que legisle contra las ciudades santuario y ha exigido que los gobernadores y alcaldes demócratas colaboren en la entrega de inmigrantes ilegales con antecedentes penales para su deportación inmediata.

Entre febrero de 2015 y marzo de 2016, Villarejo anota conversaciones con el comisario José Luis Olivera y otros mandos en las que se menciona la elaboración de 'notas de pitufeo' (blanqueo en pequeñas cantidades) anónimas enviadas a la Fiscalía Antidroga.

Según analistas, la decisión se debió principalmente al fuerte impacto negativo en las bolsas estadounidenses, que perdieron el equivalente a un billón de dólares en un solo día, junto con la oposición interna de algunos republicanos y la creciente unidad en la Unión Europea ante las presiones. Esta no es la primera vez que ocurre algo similar: en abril ya anunció subidas arancelarias globales que luego no se materializaron por el mismo motivo bursátil. Aunque supone un respiro temporal, medios como Le Monde y Financial Times advierten que Trump sigue siendo imprevisible y podría cambiar pronto de obsesión.

Brooks analiza un fenómeno cada vez más documentado: el descenso del bienestar emocional y psicológico entre los jóvenes en numerosos países del mundo, especialmente en las sociedades ricas e industrializadas. A partir de los resultados del World Happiness Report y, sobre todo, del Global Flourishing Study (GFS), el autor señala que la tradicional curva en forma de U de la felicidad a lo largo de la vida se ha deformado. Antes, los jóvenes partían de niveles relativamente altos de satisfacción vital que caían en la madurez y volvían a subir a partir de los 50 años; ahora, los jóvenes comienzan ya desde abajo y permanecen en niveles bajos durante décadas.

El GFS, basado en más de 200.000 personas de 22 países y en múltiples dimensiones del bienestar, confirma que este malestar juvenil no es exclusivo de Estados Unidos, aunque allí sea especialmente acusado.

Apenas media hora después del arranque del servicio, una avería en el centro de control de Adif en la estación de Francia ha provocado una nueva parada total de los trenes, que se ha repetido hasta en dos ocasiones a lo largo de la mañana. Este fallo no es nuevo, ya que se produjo también en julio de 2025, lo que ha vuelto a poner en evidencia la fragilidad del sistema.

Durante las primeras horas, los usuarios se han encontrado con trenes detenidos, información confusa y reaperturas intermitentes de accesos a andenes que terminaban, de nuevo, en la caída del sistema.

La iniciativa está impulsada por la Dirección générale de l’armement (DGA), que ha identificado una carencia en la capacidad francesa para producir drones consumibles a gran escala. Aunque la base tecnológica procede de la empresa Turgis Gaillard, es Renault quien aporta su experiencia en industrialización, rediseñando el dron para adaptarlo a procesos propios de la automoción, con materiales estandarizados y técnicas de montaje pensadas para grandes volúmenes.

En su obra principal, 'El hombre en busca de sentido', defiende que la vida siempre posee un significado, incluso en las situaciones más extremas de sufrimiento. Observó que quienes encontraban un propósito podían soportar el dolor sin caer en la desesperanza absoluta. Frankl propone una fórmula sencilla: la desesperanza surge del sufrimiento sin propósito (D = S - P). Si se descubre un sentido en la adversidad, esta se transforma en oportunidad de crecimiento personal.

Criticó el existencialismo de Sartre por su visión nihilista y propuso que, aunque no siempre podamos cambiar las circunstancias (biológicas, sociales o psicológicas), conservamos una libertad suprema: elegir la actitud ante lo inevitable.

Tras el parón navideño, el espacio no ha logrado recuperar los datos de audiencia con los que cerró el año y ha encadenado una racha descendente que culminó el miércoles 22 de enero con su peor registro histórico en la franja de access prime time. Esa noche, el programa firmó un 9% de cuota de pantalla y una media de 1.149.000 espectadores, cifras inéditas hasta ahora en su trayectoria en la cadena pública.

El descenso ha sido progresivo pero constante desde el regreso a la parrilla el 7 de enero. Ninguna de las emisiones posteriores ha conseguido superar el 13% de share con el que el formato se fue de vacaciones. De hecho, tras un primer dato del 12,6% justo después de Reyes, el programa no volvió a alcanzar el 12% en las semanas siguientes. En los días previos al mínimo histórico, ya se habían registrado señales preocupantes, como el 9,4% del lunes, con apena]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-revuelta-registra-su-peor-dato-de-audiencia-tras-la-vuelta-de-navidad</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-revuelta-registra-su-peor-dato-de-audiencia-tras-la-vuelta-de-navidad</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez defiende la gestión de Óscar Puente tras los accidentes ferroviarios de Adamuz y Barcelona]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, expresó durante un mitin de campaña en Huesca (Aragón) su respaldo explícito al ministro de Transportes y Movilidad Sostenible, Óscar Puente, tras los graves accidentes ferroviarios ocurridos recientemente en Adamuz (Córdoba) y en la zona de Barcelona (concretamente mencionado como Barceloan en el texto, pero contextualizado como un choque en Rodalies/Gelida). Sánchez destacó que el ministro «está gestionando y dando la cara desde el primer momento de la tragedia», poniendo a las víctimas en el centro de la respuesta con empatía, eficacia, transparencia y unidad. Recordó con cariño a las familias afectadas y mostró orgullo por los servidores públicos y las instituciones implicadas en la respuesta inmediata.

Karpathy introduce el concepto de 'marcha de nueves': cada nivel adicional de fiabilidad (de 90% a 99%, 99,9%, etc.) requiere un esfuerzo similar y enorme, debido al altísimo coste de los fallos en seguridad. Afirma que ni siquiera Waymo ha alcanzado la autonomía completa: sus despliegues son limitados (unos 2.000 vehículos en 2025), georrestringidos, poco rentables y dependen de intervención humana remota ('fleet response' o teleoperación) para resolver dudas o situaciones complejas, lo que significa que no se ha eliminado del todo al conductor, solo se ha desplaz]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-los-coches-autonomos-siguen-sin-estar-resueltos-analisis-de-expertos-y-limitaciones-reales-de-waymo-y-otras-empresas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/por-que-los-coches-autonomos-siguen-sin-estar-resueltos-analisis-de-expertos-y-limitaciones-reales-de-waymo-y-otras-empresas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenidos cuatro jóvenes en Palma por apuñalar gravemente a otro durante un robo con violencia en la plaza Quadrado]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha detenido a cuatro jóvenes como presuntos autores de un grave incidente ocurrido en la madrugada del 10 de enero de 2026 en la plaza Quadrado de Palma de Mallorca. Dos víctimas, que regresaban a casa, fueron abordadas por el grupo. Inicialmente, uno de los agresores amenazó con una navaja a una de las víctimas para robarle sus pertenencias, incluyendo una cadena que le arrancó del cuello. Mientras tanto, los otros tres asaltantes agredieron físicamente al segundo joven con golpes, patadas y puñetazos. Posteriormente, los cuatro se centraron en inmovilizar a esta segunda víctima, sujetándola para que no pudiera defenderse, y uno de ellos le propinó dos puñaladas en la cara con la navaja, una de las cuales impactó directamente en un ojo. Como consecuencia de las lesiones, el joven afectado perdió la visión en ese ojo y tuvo que ser trasladado de urgencia al Hospital Universitario Son Espases tras ser auxiliado por una conductora que pasaba por el lugar y que alertó ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenidos-cuatro-jovenes-en-palma-por-apunalar-gravemente-a-otro-durante-un-robo-con-violencia-en-la-plaza-quadrado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/detenidos-cuatro-jovenes-en-palma-por-apunalar-gravemente-a-otro-durante-un-robo-con-violencia-en-la-plaza-quadrado</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canadá descarta acuerdo de libre comercio con China y reafirma cumplimiento del T-MEC ante amenazas arancelarias de Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro canadiense, Mark Carney, ha declarado que Canadá no tiene intención de firmar un acuerdo de libre comercio con China, respetando estrictamente las obligaciones del T-MEC (Tratado entre México, Estados Unidos y Canadá). Esta posición llega tras las amenazas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien advirtió que impondría aranceles del 100% a todos los bienes canadienses si Ottawa avanzaba en un pacto comercial con Pekín. Carney explicó que los recientes acuerdos alcanzados durante su visita a Pekín buscan únicamente resolver disputas comerciales de los últimos años, no establecer un tratado de libre comercio. En 2024, Canadá aplicó aranceles del 100% a vehículos eléctricos chinos y del 25% al acero y aluminio procedentes de China, lo que provocó represalias por parte de Pekín con tasas del 100% al aceite y harina de canola canadiense, y del 25% a la carne de cerdo y mariscos.

Según Starmer, la base es esencial para la lucha contra el terrorismo y para la inteligencia británica y estadounidense, garantizando la seguridad futura de ambas naciones. Por su parte, el expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump calificó la medida como un «acto de debilidad total», aunque reconoció que el archipiélago pertenece legalmente a Mauricio. Con la devolución, la base se incluirá en el acuerdo de Pelindaba, declarando África como zona libre de armas nucleares, lo que impide el almacenamiento de armas nucleares estadounidenses en Diego García.

Los poemas recogidos abarcan distintas etapas y registros de su obra, desde la denuncia directa de la violencia estructural y la explotación hasta la reflexión ética, el amor, la memoria y la duda.

En composiciones como “Muchas maneras de matar”, Brecht enumera las formas invisibles y normalizadas de la violencia ejercida por el Estado y el sistema económico, subrayando cómo muchas de ellas no están prohibidas pese a causar muerte y sufrimiento. Otros textos, como “Preguntas de un obrero ante un libro”, cuestionan la historia oficial y ponen el foco en los trabajadores anónimos que sostienen las grandes gestas atribuidas a reyes y héroes.

Esta tecnología supera las limitaciones de los filtros convencionales, que no retienen eficientemente partículas a escala nanométrica. El sistema combina un filtro metálico recubierto de óxido de magnesio y un polímero catiónico con un generador triboeléctrico que convierte energía mecánica en electricidad, eliminando la necesidad de energía externa. Además, el filtro es regenerable: al invertir el campo eléctrico, las partículas se desprenden y el filtro puede reutilizarse más de 20 veces sin pérdida de eficacia. Las pruebas con agua del grifo y de río confirmaron su efectividad en condiciones reales, cumpliendo los estándares de calidad de la OMS.

Desde el golpe de Estado en Brasil en 1964 que derrocó al presidente João Goulart hasta el golpe militar en Chile en 1973 contra Salvador Allende, la intervención estadounidense ha estado presente en diversos países de la región. La Operación Cóndor es un ejemplo de cooperación entre dictaduras latinoamericanas para perseguir a opositores políticos, mientras que episodios como el asesinato de un exministro de Allende en Washington muestran la complejidad de estas relaciones. A finales de los años 70 y principios de los 80, con presidentes como Jimmy Carter y Ronald Reagan, la política estadounidense osciló entre restablecer ciertos controles y apoyar regímenes autoritarios. Además de los aspectos políticos, el documental aborda la influencia económica de Estados Unidos en proyectos estratégicos como el Canal de Panamá y cómo la llegada de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Complutense aclara que no se requiere titulación para redactar contratos y cuestiona la acusación de intrusismo a Begoña Gómez]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Universidad Complutense de Madrid ha remitido un informe al juez Juan Carlos Peinado en el que aclara que, según la normativa vigente, no es necesario contar con una titulación específica para redactar pliegos de prescripciones técnicas en contratos universitarios.

Según el análisis, la primera semana, del 26 de enero al 1 de febrero, estará claramente marcada por el paso continuado de frentes asociados a sistemas de bajas presiones procedentes del Atlántico. Estas borrascas dejarán lluvias en la mayor parte de la Península y Baleares, con especial intensidad y persistencia en el oeste y el sur peninsular, y de forma muy destacada en Galicia.

El patrón atmosférico previsto favorecerá la entrada de vientos húmedos y relativamente templados, lo que tendrá un impacto directo en las temperaturas, que se situarán por encima de los valores normales para esta época del año. Como consecuencia, la nieve quedará en general restringida a zonas de montaña, sin episodios relevantes en cotas bajas]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aemet-preve-varias-semanas-marcadas-por-borrascas-atlanticas-lluvias-generalizadas-y-temperaturas-suaves</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aemet-preve-varias-semanas-marcadas-por-borrascas-atlanticas-lluvias-generalizadas-y-temperaturas-suaves</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo los dispositivos que llevamos afectan nuestra privacidad y vigilancia diaria]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marta Peirano aborda en esta charla de TED cómo los dispositivos que usamos a diario, como smartphones y relojes inteligentes, actúan como herramientas de vigilancia constante.

La investigación, centrada en la Cordillera Ibérica (provincia de Teruel), utiliza registros dendrocronológicos de Pinus sylvestris y Pinus nigra para reconstruir la precipitación acumulada en un periodo clave de crecimiento anual. Gracias a la combinación de nuevas muestras recogidas en 2024 y datos históricos previos, los autores han logrado una cronología robusta y bien replicada que permite ir mucho más allá del periodo cubierto por los registros meteorológicos instrumentales.

Los resultados muestran una fuerte variabilidad de la precipitación a lo largo de los siglos, con alternancia de periodos secos y húmedos.

Se destaca la erosión de seis pilares fundamentales del poder estadounidense desde la posguerra: inmigración abierta, apoyo a la educación e investigación, comercio libre, estado de derecho, alianzas internacionales sólidas (como la OTAN) y una política monetaria independiente que respalda al dólar como moneda de reserva. En las primeras semanas de 2026, Trump ha acelerado este proceso con presiones sobre aliados, amenazas arancelarias, intervenciones federales en ciudades opositoras y ataques a la independencia de la Reserva Federal.

Los hechos ocurrieron de madrugada en un establecimiento hostelero de la plaza de La Habana, cuando varios clientes alertaron a la Policía Local tras presenciar cómo la mujer maltrataba a su perro, un cachorro de unos ocho meses.

Según relataron los testigos, la mujer salió a la terraza del local con el animal y, cuando este se acercó a una mesa, lo levantó bruscamente tirando de la correa. A continuación, lo mantuvo suspendido en el aire mientras lo zarandeaba y le gritaba. Ante esta situación, varias personas le recriminaron su comportamiento, lo que provocó una reacción aún más violenta: la mujer comenzó a golpear al cachorro con patadas y puñetazos por distintas partes del cuerpo.

Un ejemplo reciente se ha hecho viral en redes sociales tras difundirse un vídeo de una sesión de la Asamblea Nacional de Panamá celebrada en abril de 2025.

En las imágenes aparece el diputado Gabriel Solís leyendo un anteproyecto de ley preparado, según se evidencia, con ayuda de ChatGPT. El discurso transcurre con normalidad hasta que, al llegar al final, el parlamentario lee literalmente una frase que no formaba parte del contenido político, sino que era una sugerencia automática del propio chatbot dirigida al usuario que había solicitado el texto.

A través de las reflexiones del arquitecto Óscar Guillen, se introduce el concepto de ‘metápolis’, una idea que describe la expansión difusa de la ciudad más allá de sus límites tradicionales, afectando tanto a la capital catalana como a municipios cercanos.

Según Guillen, numerosos extranjeros llegan a Barcelona y a localidades del entorno buscando una imagen estereotipada de lo ‘español’, asociada a la paella, el flamenco o una vida local pintoresca. Sin embargo, se encuentran con una realidad muy distinta: cafés donde se habla inglés u otros idiomas, menús de brunch similares a los de Londres y un estilo de vida globalizado, apoyado en salarios altos, teletrabajo y servicios financieros digitales.

Inaugurada el 16 de mayo de 1968, esta autopista elevada rodeaba la Plaza del Emperador Carlos V con rampas, curvas y varios niveles, permitiendo que los vehículos cruzaran la zona sin detenerse y aliviando el intenso tráfico de la época. En los años sesenta, el auge del automóvil y el desarrollismo impulsaron esta solución ambiciosa para un nudo viario clave donde confluían importantes avenidas y la estación de tren. Aunque inicialmente cumplió su objetivo de agilizar la circulación, pronto se convirtió en un elemento muy polémico por su impacto negativo: oscurecía la plaza, ocultaba edificios históricos, generaba ruido y contaminación, y convertía el espacio en hostil para los peatones, relegando la Fuente de la Alcachofa a un segundo plano.

Las imágenes contradicen de forma significativa la versión inicial ofrecida por responsables de la administración Trump, que calificaron a Pretti como un terrorista doméstico con intención de causar el máximo daño a las fuerzas del orden. En el vídeo se observa a Pretti dirigiendo el tráfico cuando los agentes le piden que se aparte de la calzada. Él obedece y se dirige hacia la acera.

A través de una experiencia directa, Jedeed logró ser reclutada en apenas seis minutos durante un acto de captación en Texas, lo que ilustra la drástica rebaja de los controles de acceso y de los estándares profesionales.

ICE ha pasado de contar con unos 10.000 agentes a sumar aproximadamente 12.000 más en un corto periodo de tiempo. Para lograrlo, la agencia ha eliminado límites de edad, reducido la formación a solo 48 días —casi la mitad de lo habitual— y suprimido cursos clave, como el aprendizaje de castellano. Además, se han introducido incentivos económicos de hasta 50.000 dólares para atraer candidatos.

El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, desmintió públicamente esta información y aclaró que los carriles fueron fabricados por ArcelorMittal, una compañía siderúrgica con presencia internacional pero con producción en España, concretamente en su planta de Gijón.

Puente explicó que los raíles cuentan con trazabilidad completa, incluyendo la identificación de la colada de acero empleada —de unas 200 toneladas— y de los profesionales responsables de las soldaduras. Estas uniones, según detalló, fueron sometidas a controles exhaustivos mediante ultrasonidos y fluidos, superando todas las inspecciones reglamentarias previas al accidente.

En 2007, la empresa Wakayama Electric Railway tomó una decisión inusual: nombrar a una gata tricolor llamada Tama como jefa de estación honoraria en la estación de Kishi. Esta iniciativa, que comenzó como una medida simbólica, se convirtió en un fenómeno turístico inesperado. Tama, vestida con un uniforme diminuto y con su propio despacho, atrajo a miles de visitantes, generó cobertura mediática internacional, trenes decorados con su imagen y una gran cantidad de merchandising. El impacto económico se estima en cientos de millones de yenes, logrando revertir la crisis y salvar la línea.

Este gesto abre la posibilidad de un nuevo cierre federal a partir del 31 de enero, tras el cierre más largo de la historia del país entre octubre y noviembre del año pasado.

La respuesta del ministro se produce después de que el diario El Mundo publicara en portada que el accidente tuvo lugar en una zona donde se mezclaban materiales nuevos con otros instalados en 1989, insinuando posibles deficiencias en el mantenimiento de la infraestructura.

A través de un mensaje difundido en la red social X, Puente calificó esa información como “un bulo como una catedral” y denunció lo que considera un patrón recurrente tras este tipo de sucesos: primero la desgracia y, a continuación, la desinformación.

En esta fase clave del procedimiento, la jueza federal Margaret Garnett debe resolver si las pruebas encontradas en la mochila del acusado durante su arresto pueden utilizarse en el juicio o si, por el contrario, deben ser excluidas por haberse obtenido sin una orden judicial válida.

El debate se centra en los derechos constitucionales del detenido y en los límites de la actuación policial durante el arresto. La defensa de Mangione sostiene que el registro de la mochila vulneró la Cuarta Enmienda de la Constitución de Estados Unidos, que protege frente a registros e incautaciones indebidas, al no existir una orden ni concurrir circunstancias excepcionales que lo justificaran. Por ello, solicita que todo el material incautado sea declarado inadmisible.

Su obra y pensamiento cuestionaron los límites de la tecnología, la libertad humana y lo que realmente nos hace humanos. A través de su escritura, anticipó avances científicos como la fecundación artificial y criticó la búsqueda de una felicidad impuesta por la sociedad, mostrando cómo esta puede derivar en desdicha y deshumanización. Además de su faceta literaria, Huxley estudió psicología, se interesó por experiencias visionarias con drogas y exploró la espiritualidad en obras como 'La filosofía perenne', donde identifica verdades compartidas por distintas tradiciones místicas. Su enseñanza más sencilla y revolucionaria, expresada al final de su vida, es que la amabilidad es clave para una existencia plena. Expertos como Joan Garriga y Ana Merlino coinciden en que la amabilidad no solo beneficia a quienes la reciben, sino también a quienes la practican, mientras qu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aldous-huxley-y-la-importancia-de-la-amabilidad-para-una-vida-plena</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aldous-huxley-y-la-importancia-de-la-amabilidad-para-una-vida-plena</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China culmina en una noche la remodelación y conexión de una estación ferroviaria clave en Longyan]]></title><description><![CDATA[China ha vuelto a demostrar su capacidad de ejecución en grandes proyectos de infraestructuras con la remodelación y conexión de la estación ferroviaria de Nanlong, en la ciudad de Longyan, provincia de Fujian. La intervención, que se llevó a cabo en apenas nueve horas durante la noche, permitió integrar tres líneas ferroviarias existentes —Ganlong, Ganruilong y Zhanglong— con una nueva vía de alta velocidad, minimizando el impacto sobre el tráfico ferroviario habitual.

El operativo movilizó a unos 1.500 trabajadores organizados bajo una planificación extremadamente precisa. Los ingenieros responsables dividieron al personal en siete unidades operativas que trabajaron de forma simultánea en tareas muy distintas: desde el movimiento de tierras y la pavimentación con asfalto y hormigón, hasta la instalación de sistemas de señalización, control y monitorización digital del tráfico ferroviario.

Esta cifra convierte a España en el país con más descarrilamientos en el continente, superando a Francia y Alemania. Expertos en ingeniería ferroviaria señalan que la causa principal no es la mala suerte, sino fallos estructurales acumulativos en el mantenimiento de la infraestructura, especialmente en vías de alta afluencia de pasajeros como las líneas Madrid-Andalucía. La fatiga de los carriles, causada por el uso constante y la falta de mantenimiento adecuado, genera microgrietas que pueden derivar en accidentes graves, como el trágico descarrilamiento del tren Iryo en Adamuz que causó 45 muertos. Además, se destaca que España dedica solo un 16% del gasto anual al mantenimiento ferroviario, mientras que la media europea se sitúa en torno al 50%.

La Sociedad Española de Rehabilitación y Medicina Física (Sermef) aconseja una técnica conocida como 'caminar como un pingüino', que consiste en inclinar ligeramente el tronco hacia adelante, dar pasos cortos y apoyar toda la planta del pie en cada paso. También recomiendan no llevar las manos en los bolsillos, reducir la velocidad, buscar puntos de apoyo estables, utilizar pasamanos en escaleras mojadas y comprobar que el calzado mantiene un buen agarre.

Tras la muerte de Pretti a manos de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza, Rittenhouse compartió en Instagram una historia sobre 'liberar Minneapolis' y consejos de supervivencia, incluyendo una advertencia de no apuntar armas a agentes federales. Además, publicó una imagen generada por IA en la que aparece armado en la ciudad, lo que ha suscitado fuertes críticas y debates en redes sociales. Los internautas han cuestionado la incoherencia entre la defensa de Rittenhouse, considerado un héroe por algunos por sus acciones en Kenosha, y la condena hacia Pretti, quien portaba un arma con permiso pero no llegó a disparar. Las reacciones destacan la polarización existente en Estados Unidos sobre la violencia armada, la intervención policial]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kyle-rittenhouse-genera-controversia-tras-comentar-el-tiroteo-de-alex-pretti-en-minneapolis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kyle-rittenhouse-genera-controversia-tras-comentar-el-tiroteo-de-alex-pretti-en-minneapolis</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 15:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El ministro Ángel Víctor Torres propone a la UE limitar la compra de viviendas no residenciales en Canarias para abaratar precios y facilitar el acceso a residentes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El ministro de Política Territorial y ministro canario, Ángel Víctor Torres, ha remitido una propuesta a la Unión Europea para limitar, mediante mecanismos legislativos específicos en las regiones ultraperiféricas como Canarias, la adquisición de viviendas destinadas a usos no residenciales, como segundas residencias o inversiones. El objetivo principal es reducir la presión sobre el mercado inmobiliario, abaratar los precios y garantizar que los jóvenes y colectivos vulnerables puedan acceder más fácilmente a una vivienda. Esta iniciativa coincide con la petición del presidente de Canarias, Fernando Clavijo, quien también ha solicitado en Bruselas prohibir o restringir la compra de viviendas por parte de extranjeros no residentes en las islas, donde aproximadamente una de cada cuatro compraventas (25 %) corresponde a ciudadanos de otros países.

Su hijo tercero, Masud Jamenei, ha asumido las funciones cotidianas y actúa como principal enlace con el Gobierno. En paralelo, las fuerzas armadas iraníes han mostrado su disposición total a defender el territorio, destacando la unidad entre el Ejército regular y la Guardia Revolucionaria (CGRI). El contexto incluye amenazas explícitas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien ha mencionado el envío de una gran flota naval hacia la región y ha expresado que prefiere no usarla, aunque ha intensificado la presión tras las protestas en Irán con miles de muertos reprimidos.

Ante la gravedad, el conseller de Sanidad, Marciano Gómez, prometió medidas contundentes si se confirman irregularidades, aunque no aclaró si incluirían la rescisión del contrato. PSPV, Compromís y la Plataforma por la Reversión del Vinalopó exigen terminar la concesión y han anunciado acciones judiciales ante la Fiscalía, junto con protestas frente al hospital.

El contrato, prorrogado en mayo de 2025 hasta mayo de 2030, compromete a la Generalitat a pagar 826,7 millones de euros en total.

En sus declaraciones, el autor aclaró que no se trata solo del título del evento —que considera inexacto al afirmar que 'todos perdimos' la guerra, cuando los republicanos fueron los derrotados y los franquistas se beneficiaron durante décadas—, sino principalmente por la presencia de estos dos políticos.

Las grabaciones revelan que Pretti actuó en defensa de dos personas durante un operativo contra migrantes, contradiciendo las afirmaciones de que atacó a los funcionarios con un arma. En las imágenes, se observa a Pretti grabando la escena con su teléfono móvil mientras se enfrenta pacíficamente a los agentes. En un primer vídeo, retrocede tras ser empujado por un oficial. En otro, dirige el tráfico para permitir el paso de un vehículo, mientras otros ciudadanos protestan tocando silbatos, una práctica común en la zona para alertar sobre redadas migratorias ordenadas por la administración Trump.

La historia, difundida por el programa “Andalucía Directo” de Canal Sur, pone el foco en un caso concreto que refleja problemas estructurales relacionados con la vivienda y la actuación de los fondos de inversión.

La casa en cuestión no es solo el lugar donde Fran ha vivido siempre, sino también el espacio donde nació y un inmueble adaptado específicamente a sus necesidades de movilidad reducida. El origen del conflicto se remonta a años atrás, cuando su padre utilizó la vivienda como aval para una finca, lo que acabó derivando en la pérdida de la propiedad y su posterior adquisición por un fondo de inversión. Desde entonces, Fran se enfrentaba a la posibilidad real de tener que abandonar su hogar.

El autor, Ángel L.

La trama arranca con un escritor especializado en lo paranormal que ayuda a un amigo a investigar una casa aparentemente ideal pero con un plano extraño que esconde algo perturbador. Junto a un delineante, descubren que no se trata de errores de diseño, sino de estructuras deliberadas para ocultar secretos oscuros, posiblemente violentos.

De ese total, alrededor de 1.236 toneladas —casi la mitad del valor— se encuentran en suelo estadounidense.

La controversia surge en un contexto de creciente desconfianza hacia la política exterior y económica de Donald Trump.

Según la investigación en curso, la causa más probable fue la rotura del carril derecho precisamente en el punto donde se une material renovado recientemente con carriles antiguos fabricados en 1989, en la época de inauguración de la línea en 1992. La renovación del tramo Guadalmez-Córdoba, adjudicada en 2022 por 60 millones de euros y terminada en gran parte en mayo de 2025, se realizó de forma parcial: solo se renovó el desvío de agujas, dejando intacto el tramo recto donde ocurrió el siniestro. El presidente de Adif, Luis Pedro Marco de la Peña, reconoció que las renovaciones se efectúan 'por partes' en diferentes subsistemas y que la soldadura en cuestión pasó todos los controles de calidad, aunque ahora se analiza si la fra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-rotura-en-una-soldadura-entre-carriles-antiguos-y-nuevos-principal-hipotesis-del-descarrilamiento-del-iryo-en-adamuz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-rotura-en-una-soldadura-entre-carriles-antiguos-y-nuevos-principal-hipotesis-del-descarrilamiento-del-iryo-en-adamuz</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo la traición de Cardano a Tartaglia impulsó el descubrimiento de los números complejos]]></title><description><![CDATA[En la Italia del siglo XVI, la resolución de la ecuación cúbica desencadenó una de las disputas más intensas de la historia de las matemáticas. Niccolò Fontana, conocido como Tartaglia, desarrolló un método secreto para resolver ecuaciones cúbicas y lo mantuvo oculto tras vencer en duelos matemáticos públicos. Gerolamo Cardano, ambicioso autor de Ars Magna, convenció a Tartaglia para que le revelara la fórmula bajo juramento solemne de secreto, prometiendo no publicarla. Sin embargo, Cardano la incluyó en su obra de 1545, rompiendo el juramento y atribuyéndola principalmente a sí mismo, aunque mencionó a Tartaglia y a Scipione del Ferro.

Al aplicar la fórmula, surgió el 'casus irreducibilis': ecuaciones con tres raíces reales evidentes producían expresiones con raíces cuadradas de números negativos, consideradas absurdas por Cardano. Rafael Bombelli, en 1572, aceptó estas cantidades 'imposibles' como legítimas y manipuló algebraicamente expresiones como la raíz cúbica de (2 + √(-121))]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump anuncia que no asistirá al Super Bowl y critica la elección de Bad Bunny y Green Day como artistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha declarado en una entrevista con The New York Times que no asistirá al Super Bowl del próximo 8 de febrero de 2026, que se celebrará en el Levi's Stadium de Santa Clara, California.

Sin embargo, aprovechó para criticar duramente la selección de los artistas: el puertorriqueño Bad Bunny, encargado del espectáculo del medio tiempo, y el grupo Green Day, que participará en la ceremonia de apertura. Trump afirmó estar 'en contra' de ambos, calificando su elección como 'pésima' y acusándolos de 'sembrar odio'. Bad Bunny ha sido un crítico abierto de las políticas antimigratorias de Trump, mientras que Billie Joe Armstrong, vocalista de Green Day, ha apoyado recientemente las protestas en Minneapolis contra las redadas del ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas).

En 2024, el Gobierno groenlandés vetó el uso de Starlink, la constelación de satélites de órbita baja de Elon Musk, debido a sus vínculos con el Gobierno estadounidense y el Pentágono, considerándola un riesgo para la soberanía y la seguridad nacional en un contexto de posibles guerras híbridas. En su lugar, el operador nacional Tusass ha reforzado acuerdos con infraestructuras europeas. Desde 2023, varios asentamientos remotos del norte y este de Groenlandia acceden a internet mediante el satélite geoestacionario Amazonas Nexus, operado por la española Hispasat.

El autor argumenta que Abascal no merece ser calificado de 'extrema derecha' en el sentido ideológico clásico, sino que lo tacha de 'extremo comepollas' por su supuesto servilismo y apoyo entusiasta a las políticas del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y a lo que describe como 'masacre sionista'. En concreto, señala que Abascal aplaude las redadas migratorias ('la migra') en EE.UU. y las toma como inspiración para aplicarlas en España. El texto contextualiza este posicionamiento en el supuesto miedo anglosajón a la creciente hispanización del sur de Estados Unidos, donde la población hispana demográficamente empuja con fuerza y el uso del español se extiende.

El anuncio fue realizado por la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, quien subrayó el valor científico del hallazgo al tratarse de un contexto funerario prácticamente intacto, capaz de aportar información directa sobre la organización social, los rituales y la cosmovisión zapoteca durante el periodo Clásico.

La tumba presenta una arquitectura compleja, con antecámara y cámara funeraria, en la que cada elemento escultórico y pictórico posee un significado simbólico preciso.

El trabajo contextualiza el uso de las sanciones como una herramienta recurrente de presión política y económica sobre países del denominado Sur Global, especialmente aquellos que han intentado desarrollar políticas soberanas al margen de los intereses occidentales.

El neurocientífico Michel Desmurget, en su conferencia 'La lectura en 2050' del Instituto Diderot, afirma que mientras los cómics tienen un efecto cognitivo casi nulo, los medios digitales como redes sociales o mensajes cortos tienen incluso un impacto negativo en el cerebro.

La posible medida contaría con el respaldo de sectores críticos con el Gobierno cubano dentro de la propia Administración y del secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, aunque no existe todavía una decisión definitiva. El debate interno gira en torno a si es necesario llegar a ese extremo, dado que el corte del petróleo venezolano —tras el endurecimiento de sanciones y restricciones a buques— ya ha tenido un impacto significativo en la economía cubana, que lleva años en una situación de semiparálisis.

Según el DHS, el hombre estaba armado y se resistió al arresto, aunque no se ha aclarado si portaba el arma en el momento exacto del disparo ni todos los detalles previos del forcejeo. El suceso, captado parcialmente en vídeo, provocó una rápida respuesta policial local, cierres de calles y enfrentamientos entre manifestantes y agentes, que utilizaron gas lacrimógeno para dispersar a la multitud.

El alcalde de Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, compareció en rueda de prensa visiblemente indignado y cuestionó la estrategia federal con duras palabras: «¿Cuántos residentes más? ¿Cuántos estadouniden]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/agentes-federales-abaten-a-un-hombre-armado-en-minneapolis-durante-operacion-migratoria-el-alcalde-frey-critica-duramente-el-incidente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/agentes-federales-abaten-a-un-hombre-armado-en-minneapolis-durante-operacion-migratoria-el-alcalde-frey-critica-duramente-el-incidente</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comunidades Mapuche-Tehuelche denuncian abandono estatal y criminalización durante incendios en la Patagonia Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[Comunidades Mapuche-Tehuelche de la provincia de Chubut, en la Patagonia argentina, han emitido un contundente comunicado rechazando las acusaciones del gobierno provincial que los responsabilizan por los incendios forestales recientes.

Según un audio filtrado y divulgado por el periodista Orlando Avendaño, Rodríguez relató que ella, junto a Diosdado Cabello y Jorge Rodríguez, recibieron un ultimátum de solo 15 minutos para responder a demandas estadounidenses y 'recuperar el control de la narrativa' tras la eliminación de Maduro como figura central del régimen, bajo amenaza de ser neutralizados o asesinados. El audio, que data de los días posteriores al operativo, revela que el régimen chavista no anticipaba la escala del ataque militar estadounidense en Caracas, descrito por Rodríguez como una intervención 'impecable y devastadora' que incluyó bombardeos en la capital venezolana.

La norma prohíbe expresamente a los bancos y entidades conceder créditos, emitir tarjetas de crédito o ampliar límites de financiación sin solicitud previa y consentimiento expreso del cliente. Esta medida aborda prácticas habituales en el sector, como el envío de tarjetas no pedidas o el incremento unilateral de líneas de crédito, que ya estaban parcialmente limitadas por la Ley de Servicios de Pagos, pero ahora se endurecen.

La regulación abarca un amplio espectro de productos: préstamos personales, microcréditos, créditos rápidos, pagos fraccionados tipo 'buy now, pay later' y tarjetas revolving.

Los Chromebooks, portátiles económicos basados en ChromeOS, han sido distribuidos en centros educativos no solo por su bajo coste y facilidad de uso, sino también como parte de una estrategia para que los niños se acostumbren a su ecosistema tecnológico. El informe de Google indica que si un usuario empieza a usar un sistema operativo o plataformas como YouTube desde temprana edad, es más probable que continúe utilizándolos en la vida adulta, generando así fidelidad a la marca. Aunque ChromeOS representa actualmente solo el 1,24% del mercado de ordenadores, la compañía considera que su presencia en escuelas puede influir en futuras decisiones de compra.

Sin embargo, al llegar la noche, quedaron atrapadas al no haber asegurado ningún medio de transporte para el regreso. La línea de autobús 692 (la principal conexión pública) ya había finalizado su servicio, recortado además por la borrasca, y ninguno de los excursionistas disponía de vehículo propio ni de cadenas u otros medios para descender por sus propios medios.

Las condiciones meteorológicas eran extremas: temperaturas bajo cero, visibilidad muy reducida y fuerte temporal de nieve. Ante el riesgo inminente de hipotermia por exposición prolongada al frío, se activó un dispositivo de rescate coordinado por Emergencias 112 de la Comunidad de Madrid.

A finales de 2025, más de 68 mil adultos estaban detenidos por el ICE, frente a 36 mil en 2023. En los primeros días de 2026, ya se registraron seis muertes adicionales, incluyendo casos de suicidio y problemas de salud relacionados con el corazón. Observadores externos, como la ACLU, han denunciado que hasta el 95% de estas muertes podrían haberse prevenido con atención médica adecuada, revelando retrasos y tratamientos inapropiados en los centros de detención.

Sus padres, Ernesto Alonso y Marbella Carranza, intentaron buscar apoyo médico y económico para su hospitalización mediante una campaña en GoFundMe, pero el estado de salud de la niña se deterioró rápidamente y no sobrevivió. La familia denunció que las autoridades escolares no actuaron ante las reiteradas denuncias de acoso, dejando a Jocelynn sin protección.

La información detalla cómo, pese a la rápida llegada de vecinos y servicios de emergencia, el rescate estuvo marcado por fallos de coordinación: retrasos de más de dos horas en declarar el nivel de alerta adecuado, ausencia de un puesto de mando avanzado durante casi dos horas, falta de medios técnicos y dependencia de teléfonos móviles para dirigir el operativo.

Esto permitiría instalar infraestructuras militares avanzadas, como granjas de servidores de IA, sistemas de alerta temprana, armas láser contra misiles hipersónicos rusos y puertos para vigilar rutas árticas y submarinos nucleares de Rusia.

Para justificar su presencia, el agente afirmó estar interrogando a una confidente dentro de una operación confidencial contra el narcotráfico.

La escena, acompañada por montañas y la bandera groenlandesa, provocó una oleada de críticas debido a un error geográfico elemental: los pingüinos no habitan en el hemisferio norte, sino exclusivamente en el sur. Este detalle fue suficiente para que numerosos internautas cuestionaran el rigor y el conocimiento de la Administración estadounidense, generando además múltiples montajes satíricos en los que Trump aparece huyendo de osos polares o caracterizado como un payaso.

Más allá del episodio viral, la noticia se enmarca en un contexto político y geoestratégico mucho más serio. En paralelo a la polémica por la imagen, la primera ministra danesa, Mette Frederiksen, y el presidente de Groenlandia, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, mantuvieron reuniones para analizar e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-casa-blanca-por-una-imagen-generada-por-ia-de-trump-en-groenlandia-y-el-trasfondo-politico-en-el-artico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/criticas-a-la-casa-blanca-por-una-imagen-generada-por-ia-de-trump-en-groenlandia-y-el-trasfondo-politico-en-el-artico</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La bolsa de agua caliente como solución eficiente y sostenible para la calefacción personal]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo defiende el uso de la bolsa de agua caliente como un método ancestral pero muy efectivo de calefacción personal, portátil y de bajo consumo energético. Este dispositivo, que consiste en un recipiente relleno de agua caliente colocado directamente sobre el cuerpo, permite calentar a las personas en lugar de calentar espacios enteros, lo que lo hace ideal tanto en interiores como en exteriores, en casa, en el trabajo o incluso en terrazas de bares como alternativa a los calefactores eléctricos o de gas.

Desde 2024, la partida para cooperación ha pasado de unos 450.000 euros anuales a quedarse en 220.000 euros, una reducción cercana al 50% que ya está afectando de forma directa a proyectos humanitarios y al funcionamiento de entidades con décadas de trayectoria. Según la Coordinadora Granadina de ONGs (CONGRA), estas ayudas no son complementarias, sino estructurales, y su desaparición pone en riesgo iniciativas esenciales.

El recorte se produce en un contexto económico que, según las asociaciones, no lo justifica. El presupuesto de la Diputación para 2026 asciende a 418,5 millones de euros, con superávit previsto y deuda cero. Pese a ello, la cooperación internacional apenas representa el 0,1% del total y su reducción tiene un impacto mínimo en las cuentas provinciales pero muy grave para las ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-diputacion-de-granada-recorta-a-la-mitad-la-cooperacion-internacional-y-prioriza-otras-partidas-presupuestarias</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-diputacion-de-granada-recorta-a-la-mitad-la-cooperacion-internacional-y-prioriza-otras-partidas-presupuestarias</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El colapso de las urgencias revela el avance de la privatización y el deterioro de la sanidad pública en España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La sanidad pública española atraviesa una situación crítica reflejada en el colapso generalizado de los servicios de urgencias hospitalarias. Según el artículo, la presión asistencial ha aumentado un 30% respecto a picos históricos previos, afectando a hospitales de prácticamente todas las comunidades autónomas. Las urgencias se han convertido en la puerta de entrada al sistema sanitario debido al progresivo desmantelamiento de la Atención Primaria, incapaz de absorber la demanda por falta de financiación, personal y recursos.

Esta saturación impacta especialmente en la población sin seguros privados, que representa alrededor del 60%, y que ve deteriorada la calidad y seguridad de la atención recibida.

Trump sugirió en una entrevista que los aliados enviaron tropas pero «se quedaron un poco atrás, un poco fuera de las líneas del frente», lo que ha generado indignación en Reino Unido. Starmer rindió homenaje a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en la misión y subrayó que nunca olvidará su valentía y sacrificio. El príncipe Harry también intervino, afirmando que los sacrificios de los soldados británicos merecen «ser hablados con verdad y respeto».

La víctima, que se encontraba en proceso de separación de su expareja, salió a la calle pidiendo auxilio antes de desplomarse.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las cinco de la tarde en el lugar de O Castro, en la parroquia de Seixo, cuando el afectado se encontraba realizando trabajos de soldadura en un galpón anexo a su vivienda.

Según informaron fuentes sanitarias, el hombre procedió a cortar una bombona que creía vacía por motivos que no han trascendido. Sin embargo, el cilindro aún contenía gas en su interior y, al entrar en contacto con la herramienta eléctrica, se produjo una fuerte explosión que destrozó por completo el galpón. Como consecuencia del estallido, el hombre sufrió heridas de gravedad, entre ellas una profunda brecha en la frente, por lo que fue evacuado de urgencia en una UVI móvil al Hospital de Montecelo, en Pontevedra.

Lejos de investigarse los hechos, la Administración Trump ha calificado a la víctima de “terrorista” sin aportar pruebas y ha mantenido la impunidad del agente implicado, lo que ha actuado como detonante de una respuesta social masiva.

El Congreso andorrano dio luz verde a un proyecto de ley que introduce cambios en la normativa migratoria, fiscal y de vivienda, con especial impacto sobre grandes fortunas, inversores extranjeros y trabajadores por cuenta propia como youtubers e influencers.

El objetivo principal de la reforma es contener la especulación inmobiliaria en un territorio con una superficie muy limitada y un mercado de vivienda tensionado. Según expertos legales, el auge descontrolado de la inversión en inmuebles había elevado de forma significativa los precios, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda para la población residente. Para corregir esta situación, la nueva normativa incrementa el impuesto por la compra de vivienda del 3% al 6% sobre el valor de adquisición.

El programa utiliza fondos públicos del American Rescue Plan Act para comprar deudas médicas a hospitales y agencias de cobro por una fracción de su valor y, posteriormente, anularlas por completo. No existe un proceso de solicitud: las personas beneficiarias reciben una carta en su domicilio informándoles de que parte o la totalidad de su deuda ha sido eliminada.

Madrid, sostiene, se ha vuelto previsible, convertida en un producto que responde a una estrategia de marketing urbano basada en atraer talento, turistas e inversiones, más que en cuidar la vida cotidiana de quienes la habitan.

Bravo critica la transformación de la ciudad en una marca que prioriza restaurantes de moda, grandes eventos y campañas publicitarias, fomentando la segmentación social y el individualismo.

Dirigiéndose en segunda persona a su hija nonata, la protagonista mantiene un diálogo íntimo y esperanzador mientras enfrenta el aislamiento, el frío y la precariedad. El narrador, dubitativo e impersonal, adopta un tono cíclico y letánico, centrado en los elementos naturales (montaña, nieve, animales) y en la sonoridad del lenguaje.

A diferencia de relatos de supervivencia épicos o históricos, esta obra prescinde casi por completo de anclajes temporales y geográficos concretos —salvo sutiles evocaciones rifeñas—, lo que le confiere una dimensión universal.

Al incluir el impacto sobre ecosistemas marinos, pesca, infraestructuras costeras, arrecifes de coral y manglares —el llamado “capital azul”—, el coste por tonelada de CO₂ emitida pasa de unos 51 dólares a cerca de 97 dólares, lo que supone un incremento de aproximadamente el 91%.

Este dato es crucial porque el coste social del carbono es la base sobre la que se diseñan políticas públicas como los impuestos al carbono o los sistemas de comercio de emisiones. Subestimar ese coste implica tomar decisiones políticas y económicas profundamente erróneas.

Esta propuesta forma parte de una visión más amplia que incluye abandonar la OTAN, reducir la dependencia de armamento estadounidense y desmantelar progresivamente la alianza de defensa entre ambos países. Polanski argumenta que la excesiva reliance en los intereses estadounidenses resulta preocupante, especialmente bajo la presidencia de Donald Trump, a quien describe como poco fiable y peligroso, comparándolo —aunque sin equipararlo directamente— con Vladimir Putin.

Estos pertenecen a la llamada 'quinta gama': alimentos cocinados de forma industrial, envasados al vacío o en atmósfera controlada, y listos para calentar y servir mediante horno o microondas. Según la Federación Española de Hostelería y Restauración (FEHR), la mayoría de los locales incorporan en mayor o menor medida este tipo de productos, motivados por el ahorro en personal, tiempo y equipamiento, ya que no requieren fogones ni cocineros especializados.

A diferencia de los precocinados ultraprocesados de supermercado, cargados de aditivos, grasas y azúcares, la quinta gama busca mantener sabor, textura y apariencia similares a lo casero, minimizando conservantes artificiales.

El autor sostiene que esta añoranza es comprensible, ya que los seres humanos necesitamos lazos sociales, incluso de baja intensidad, para nuestro bienestar.

Sin embargo, el texto desmonta el argumento habitual de la extrema derecha que atribuye la desaparición de esa comunidad a la inmigración. El razonamiento es simple pero erróneo: si la comunidad se diluye al mismo tiempo que llegan nuevos vecinos de otros países, se concluye que estos son los responsables.

Esta causa es independiente del conocido como ‘caso Hidrocarburos’, en el que Rivas y Aldama llegaron a ingresar en prisión preventiva por una presunta defraudación de 182,5 millones de euros en IVA entre 2022 y 2024 a través de la empresa Villafuel, investigada por el juez Santiago Pedraz.

Según los datos oficiales de Adif, la inversión ha experimentado un fuerte incremento en los últimos años: de aproximadamente 1.700 millones de euros en 2017 se ha pasado a cerca de 5.000 millones en 2025, con 4.700 millones ya ejecutados hasta noviembre de ese año. Este crecimiento supone una triplicación de la cifra respecto al periodo anterior.

El análisis compara diferentes etapas políticas. Durante el mandato de Mariano Rajoy (2012-2018), las inversiones se redujeron significativamente (hasta un 16% en algunos periodos y un 60% en comparación con los años previos a la crisis), alcanzando mínimos en 2016 con 1.657 millones.

Un vehículo que participaba en dicha concentración se salió de la vía por el margen derecho en un cruce, arrollando a varios peatones que se encontraban en un paso de cebra y en la acera contigua. El suceso dejó un balance de nueve personas heridas: tres de ellas en estado grave y seis con lesiones leves, según el comunicado oficial de la Guardia Civil (aunque algunas fuentes mencionan variaciones en la gravedad). Todos los peatones afectados fueron trasladados al Hospital de Cabueñes para recibir atención médica.

La XV enmienda, tras la Guerra Civil, introdujo el derecho a voto para ciudadanos sin distinción de raza, color o condición de exesclavo, pero dejó otras posibles restricciones intactas. Los tribunales y legisladores sureños aprovecharon estas lagunas mediante exámenes de alfabetización, impuestos y cláusulas de abuelo, que limitaron de facto el voto de los afroamericanos durante décadas, dando lugar a las leyes de segregación Jim Crow.

El estudio subraya que en 2025 el número de milmillonarios superó los 3.000, mientras que figuras como Elon Musk acumulan fortunas de cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Este fenómeno contrasta con una realidad global marcada por la pobreza: la mitad de la población mundial vive con menos de 8,3 dólares al día y más de una cuarta parte sufre inseguridad alimentaria.

Según la versión de DHS, el padre había reingresado ilegalmente al país tras una deportación previa y los agentes intentaron entregar a la niña a su madre, quien se negó. La abogada de la familia, Kira Kelley, afirma que los agentes rompieron las ventanillas del coche en la entrada de la vivienda, no mostraron orden judicial y que tanto el padre como la menor tienen solicitudes de asilo activas sin orden final de expulsión. Menos de cinco horas después de la detención, la abogada presentó una petición de emergencia para su liberación. Un juez federal, Kathy Menendez, ordenó a las 20:11 horas prohibir la salida del estado de ambos y liberar a la niña antes de las 21:30, citando daño irreparable.

La norma, firmada por el gobernador saliente Phil Murphy, afectará a más de 300.000 alumnos de primaria, que volverán a aprender cursiva entre tercero y quinto grado a partir del próximo curso escolar.

La escritura cursiva había desaparecido de los planes de estudio en muchos estados de EEUU a partir de 2010, cuando los Estándares Estatales Básicos Comunes dejaron de exigirla de forma explícita.

Se trata de la fase theta del nitruro de tantalio, capaz de transportar el calor a una velocidad cercana a los 1.100 W/m·K, casi tres veces superior a la del cobre, que hasta ahora era el estándar en sistemas de disipación térmica.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista Science, supone un cambio relevante en la comprensión de cómo se transporta el calor en los metales. Durante décadas, se asumía que la interacción entre electrones y fonones imponía un límite difícil de superar. Sin embargo, la estructura atómica del nitruro de tantalio en fase theta —con átomos de tantalio dispuestos en un patrón hexagonal y nitrógeno intercalado— reduce de forma drástica la fricción térmica interna, permitiendo un flujo de calor mucho más eficiente.

En el ejercicio, diseñado para probar la capacidad operativa de la OTAN en condiciones árticas extremas, los soldados finlandeses actuaron como fuerza atacante, mientras que las unidades estadounidenses, incluidas tropas del Cuerpo de Marines y del Ejército de Tierra, asumieron el papel defensivo.

Cameron destacó que Nueva Zelanda logró eliminar el virus en dos ocasiones y que, cuando reapareció en una variante mutada, el país ya contaba con una tasa de vacunación cercana al 98%. Frente a esto, contrastó la situación estadounidense, donde la vacunación se quedó en torno al 62% y, según él, siguió una tendencia descendente. Para el director, esta diferencia refleja una brecha más profunda: la capacidad de una sociedad para actuar de forma cohesionada y basar sus decisiones en el conocimiento científico.

La investigación, que analizó el comportamiento de un amplio número de perros, encontró que aproximadamente el 10% de los perros salchicha exhiben rasgos agresivos, una proporción significativamente mayor que la media de otras razas. Los investigadores atribuyen esta tendencia a una combinación de factores genéticos, históricos y de entrenamiento. Históricamente, los perros salchicha fueron criados para cazar tejones y otros animales subterráneos, lo que requería valentía y determinación, características que podrían haber contribuido a su predisposición a la agresividad.

Tecé argumenta que el odio, entendido como rechazo firme hacia determinadas actitudes o estructuras de poder, ha sido históricamente un motor de cambio social.

Fanone, quien sufrió graves lesiones durante el ataque y posteriormente se jubiló de la policía, ha sido un crítico de la respuesta política a los eventos del 6 de enero y ha entrevistado previamente al líder de Dropkick Murphys, Ken Casey.

A pesar del riesgo inminente, el expresidente Donald Trump aprovechó la situación para minimizar la relevancia del cambio climático, publicando en Truth Social comentarios irónicos que cuestionan la existencia del calentamiento global y lo califican de 'estafa'. La postura de Trump y de muchos miembros del Partido Republicano ha sido históricamente escéptica frente a la ciencia climática, a pesar de que organismos como la NOAA explican que olas de frío extremo no contradicen el calentamiento global. De hecho, el cambio climático puede incluso aumentar la intensidad de algunas tormentas invernales al aportar más humedad y energía térmica a la atmósfera.

Sin embargo, esta estrategia no ha tenido el efecto deseado. Los datos muestran un crecimiento significativo en las ventas de coches chinos en Europa, destacando especialmente a marcas como MG y BYD. MG finalizó el año en el puesto 16 del mercado europeo, superando a marcas consolidadas como CUPRA, Nissan y Fiat. Por su parte, BYD ascendió al puesto 22, superando a Suzuki, MINI y Mazda. En total, los fabricantes chinos vendieron más de 810.000 unidades en 2025, lo que supone un incremento del 99% respecto a 2024, y representando aproximadamente uno de cada diez coches nuevos vendidos en Europa.

La nota recuerda que Trump aprendió de su abogado Roy Cohn una estrategia basada en la mentira sistemática, el ataque a las autoridades y la manipulación de la opinión pública. Tras los rumores de una posible intervención militar en Groenlandia y el anuncio de precios exorbitantes por el territorio, Trump ha creado una especie de versión personal de la ONU, denominada 'Junta de Paz', que preside él mismo y en la que ya ha puesto a la venta sillones de miembros permanentes por mil millones de dólares cada uno.

El tribunal argumentó que las tuberías son infraestructura civil, no militar, y que las acciones encubiertas no están cubiertas por el derecho internacional humanitario, ya que no hay pruebas de que actuara con uniforme o órdenes estatales explícitas. Por ello, el sospechoso será juzgado por violar la seguridad interna de Alemania y atentar contra su soberanía, e incluso podría investigarse como crimen de guerra por atacar instalaciones civiles.

El fuerte oleaje y la erosión marina provocados por el temporal dejaron al descubierto una serie de estructuras sumergidas frente a la actual ciudad de Nabeul que podrían corresponder a la antigua Neápolis, una ciudad de origen púnico que más tarde fue romanizada y cuya localización exacta llevaba siglos siendo objeto de debate.

Según los investigadores, las ruinas visibles incluyen muros, bloques de piedra y trazados urbanos que sugieren la existencia de un asentamiento costero de cierta entidad. Las fuentes clásicas ya mencionaban que Neápolis sufrió un devastador maremoto en el siglo IV d.C., un desastre natural que habría provocado el hundimiento parcial de la ciudad bajo el mar. Los nuevos restos observados encajan con esta descripción histórica y refuerzan la hipótesis de que una parte significativa del núcleo urbano quedó sumergida de forma permanente.

La decisión, tomada por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), ha causado sorpresa e indignación entre los fiscales federales, que tenían previsto llevar al acusado a juicio y solicitar una pena de hasta 15 años de prisión.

Presilla Flores estaba acusado, junto a otras seis personas, de vigilar un camión blindado de la empresa Brinks en 2022 y aprovechar una parada en un área de descanso rural al norte de Los Ángeles para sustraer diamantes, esmeraldas, rubíes, oro y relojes de lujo.

Según la experta Profesora Helen Roy, del UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology y la Universidad de Exeter, este fenómeno se debe a varios factores favorables: un invierno benigno que permitió una buena emergencia de mariquitas tras la hibernación, una abundancia temprana de pulgones (su principal alimento) gracias a una primavera seca, y periodos de calor y humedad en verano que aceleraron su ciclo vital y reproducción.

Muchas de las mariquitas avistadas podrían ser de la especie arlequín, invasora y propensa a agruparse en grandes números, especialmente en paredes soleadas o en interiores buscando refugio. A pesar de las apariencias, las mariquitas son completamente inofensivas para humanos y mascotas: no pican, no son venenosas y no transmiten enfermedades.

El caso, que involucra una importante cantidad de cocaína, ha generado controversia por la fragilidad de las pruebas presentadas por la acusación. Los abogados defensores argumentaron que la investigación carecía de solidez y que no existían pruebas concluyentes que ligaran a sus clientes con el alijo. La sentencia, dictada tras un juicio celebrado entre noviembre y diciembre de 2025, no es firme y puede ser recurrida ante el Tribunal Supremo.

Según el documento, las muestras de la vía fueron retiradas bajo supervisión de la Policía Judicial y trasladadas a Madrid para su análisis, junto con los registradores de datos tanto del tren accidentado como de un tren Alvia que circulaba por la misma línea. Este primer informe refuerza la hipótesis de que la fractura en el raíl pudo existir antes del paso del tren, aunque la investigación sigue abierta y se esperan más conclusiones.

La presidenta madrileña reivindicó la figura de Gregorio Ordóñez en un acto del PP por el 31 aniversario de su asesinato, para criticar al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez por supuestamente 'blanquear' a ETA y plantear si un nuevo político como él tendría que vivir escoltado hoy en día. Ordóñez acusó al PP de practicar un odio más cruel que el recibido en su día de la izquierda abertzale, denominando al partido de 'derecha abertzale'. Afirmó que su hermano sería considerado un 'hereje' por el PP actual, ya que defendía los derechos ciudadanos sin exaltar patrias ni banderas (salvo la de Donostia), trataba a los adversarios con respeto y confiaba en la rebelión ciudadana contra ETA, no en discursos altisonantes.

La colisión ocurrió en un tramo gestionado por un consorcio de empresas privadas que construyen, mantienen y supervisan sus propios trabajos, lo que según los sindicatos de maquinistas ha reducido significativamente el control público sobre la seguridad. A pesar de la histórica inversión estatal de 4.500 millones de euros en 2024, la mayor parte se destinó a nuevas infraestructuras de alta velocidad, mientras que el mantenimiento de la red convencional quedó insuficientemente financiado. En Catalunya, por ejemplo, entre 2015 y 2022 solo se ejecutó un tercio del presupuesto previsto, reflejando un deterioro en los servicios y un aumento de averías.

El tribunal confirma la pena de dos años y seis meses de prisión impuesta al maquinista Francisco Garzón Amo como autor de 79 delitos de homicidio y 143 de lesiones por imprudencia grave. Los magistrados concluyen que el descarrilamiento se debió exclusivamente a la distracción del conductor, quien circulaba a casi 200 km/h en una curva limitada a 80 km/h mientras mantenía una conversación telefónica innecesaria con el interventor, ignorando señales visuales y acústicas. Se descarta la falta de formación o desconocimiento del tramo por parte del maquinista.

Durante la inspección del material rodante se han detectado muescas en las ruedas del lado derecho de varios coches del Iryo, compatibles con el impacto contra un carril previamente roto.

Esta medida, vigente desde 2021 pero demorada por el Ayuntamiento debido a la pandemia de covid-19, busca mejorar la accesibilidad para personas invidentes y con movilidad reducida, garantizando un paso más amplio en las aceras.

Muchos propietarios reconocen que la intención es positiva, pero denuncian el impacto económico y práctico.

Esta acción se enmarca dentro del cumplimiento del real decreto ley de medidas urgentes contra el genocidio en Gaza y de apoyo a la población palestina, aprobado en septiembre de 2025, que prohíbe la publicidad de bienes y servicios procedentes de territorios ocupados. Según el ministerio, los indicios apuntan a que varias empresas israelíes podrían estar ofreciendo viajes a localidades como Jericó, en la Cisjordania palestina ocupada, aprovechando la relevancia de Fitur y la afluencia de miles de visitantes.

Aunque los seres vivos empezaron a desarrollar sistemas nerviosos complejos hace cientos de millones de años, aún no se sabe cómo surge la experiencia subjetiva. La neurociencia ha avanzado en identificar correlatos neuronales de la conciencia, como redes cerebrales cuya actividad refleja estados conscientes o inconscientes, y herramientas como la estimulación magnética transcraneal (TMS) combinada con electroencefalografía (EEG) permiten medir la complejidad cerebral asociada a la conciencia. Sin embargo, estas técnicas solo describen cómo el cerebro alcanza la conciencia, no por qué se siente de determinada manera. Existen múltiples teorías para explicar este fenómeno: la teoría del espacio de trabajo neuronal global (GNWT), que ve la conciencia como un escenario donde la información se proyecta y se integra; las teorías de orden superior, que dependen de representaciones meta-cognitivas; las teorías de reentrada y ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Víctimas de residencias critican la propuesta de Ayuso de un funeral en Madrid por el accidente de Adamuz como un intento de protagonismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha anunciado su intención de organizar una misa funeral en la catedral de La Almudena por las víctimas del grave accidente ferroviario ocurrido en Adamuz (Córdoba) el 18 de enero de 2026, donde un tren Iryo descarriló e invadió la vía contraria, colisionando con un Alvia de Renfe y dejando 45 fallecidos y más de un centenar de heridos. Este anuncio llega tras días de silencio político por parte de Ayuso, rompiendo la unidad mostrada inicialmente entre administraciones. El funeral oficial de Estado se celebrará en Huelva el 31 de enero, dado que la mayoría de víctimas eran andaluzas, especialmente de esa provincia. La propuesta de Ayuso ha generado polémica por su carácter religioso (cuando los funerales de Estado suelen ser laicos) y por realizarse en Madrid, lejos del lugar del suceso.

Esta oferta premium promete mayor confort, serenidad y servicios personalizados (acceso a salones, cambios sin coste, espacio dedicado para trabajar o descansar), pero incluye una restricción: el espacio tranquilo está reservado a viajeros a partir de 12 años, por lo que no se pueden reservar plazas allí para niños menores de esa edad. La medida afecta solo a un porcentaje reducido de plazas (alrededor del 8% entre semana), y la SNCF defiende que responde a demandas de clientes que buscan tranquilidad, recordando que ya existía una limitación similar en la oferta anterior sin apenas críticas.

El personaje encarna una concepción nómada de la vida, tanto en lo geográfico como en lo ideológico, y funciona como un alter ego idealizado de su autor. A lo largo de los trece álbumes publicados entre 1967 y 1988, Pratt construyó un universo marcado por el viaje constante, la falta de arraigo y una profunda melancolía que se expresa tanto en los silencios como en su característico blanco y negro de trazo impresionista.

La biografía de Pratt resulta clave para entender la obra. Hijo de un funcionario destinado en la Etiopía colonial, pasó su infancia entre Venecia, África y más tarde Argentina, donde su contacto con Héctor Germán Oesterheld fue decisivo para su madurez artística. De esa etapa surgieron trabajos fundamentales como Ernie Pike o Sargento Kirk, que asentaron una forma de narrar basada en la sugerencia, el ritmo pausado y la primacía ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Filtración masiva de datos personales de 47 políticos autonómicos de 15 comunidades, incluyendo varios presidentes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un atacante conocido como 'Eurogosth' ha publicado en un portal especializado en doxxing datos personales de 47 políticos de alto nivel pertenecientes a 15 comunidades autónomas españolas.

A diferencia de muchos materiales etiquetados como biodegradables o compostables, que solo se degradan en condiciones industriales muy concretas, este plástico se comporta como uno convencional durante su uso cotidiano y se descompone cuando entra en contacto con el agua de mar.

El material está formado por componentes iónicos sencillos que se autoensamblan en una red tridimensional resistente mediante enlaces conocidos como puentes salinos. En presencia de sal marina, estos enlaces se rompen porque los iones compiten entre sí, provocando que el plástico se disuelva en cuestión de horas en moléculas que pueden ser metabolizadas por bacterias. En el suelo, además, se degrada en pocos días y libera nutrientes como fósforo y nitrógeno.

Tras comentarios sobre una posible anexión de Canadá y la imposición de aranceles, los canadienses lanzaron una campaña bajo el lema 'codos arriba', que provocó caídas significativas en las importaciones de bebidas alcohólicas estadounidenses (hasta un 60% en bourbon y whisky), zumo de naranja de Florida y una reducción notable en viajes a EE.UU., con impactos económicos millonarios para el país vecino.

En paralelo, Europa enfrenta una situación similar tras el anuncio de Trump de aranceles del 10-25% a varios países europeos (incluyendo Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega, Francia, Alemania, Países Bajos, Finlandia y Reino Unido) por oponerse a la anexión de Groenlandia a partir de febrero de 2026.

La víctima sufrió una pérdida del 84% de visión en el ojo izquierdo debido a una rotura coroidea y una hemorragia subretiniana, según los informes médicos. La agresión comenzó dentro de la discoteca por un conflicto verbal que involucraba a uno de los amigos de la víctima y continuó en el exterior, donde el joven fue rodeado y golpeado con puñetazos y patadas por varios miembros del grupo agresor. Las cámaras de seguridad permitieron reconstruir los hechos y confirmar que hubo una actuación coordinada entre los agresores.

Estas acciones han sido criticadas por organizaciones como el Movimiento Boicot, Desinversiones y Sanciones a Israel (BDS), que denuncian la utilización del turismo como herramienta de propaganda para mejorar la imagen del Estado israelí mientras persiste la ocupación ilegal según resoluciones de la ONU. A pesar de estas denuncias y de las demandas de colectivos sociales y parlamentarios, Ifema mantiene la participación de Israel, recordando que este país ha estado presente en todas las ediciones de Fitur desde 1981.

El gobierno estadounidense justifica esta decisión citando deficiencias de la OMS en la gestión de crisis sanitarias y la influencia política de otros estados miembros, especialmente China. Washington aportaba hasta el 25% del presupuesto de la agencia y consideraba que otros países, como China, no pagaban cuotas equivalentes, generando un trato que consideran injusto. Además, destacan que la OMS nunca tuvo un director general estadounidense y que el organismo no asumió responsabilidad por fallos pasados. La administración Trump ha confirmado que no abonará los compromisos correspondientes al periodo 2024-2025, que ascienden a entre 260 y 280 millones de dólares.

Esta ley exige prueba documental de ciudadanía (como certificado de nacimiento o pasaporte) para registrarse o actualizar el voto en elecciones federales, lo que podría afectar a unos 69 millones de mujeres estadounidenses que cambiaron su apellido al casarse, ya que sus certificados de nacimiento no coinciden con sus documentos actuales. El autor predice que los republicanos aprobarán la norma en el Senado a última hora antes de las midterm de 2026, generando una crisis de documentación masiva cuando ya no sea posible corregir discrepancias a tiempo.

A nivel global, el grupo francés vendió 1.628.030 vehículos, sumando turismos y vehículos comerciales ligeros, lo que supone un crecimiento del 3,2 % respecto a 2024. El mayor impulso provino de los turismos, con 1.292.000 unidades matriculadas y un aumento del 10 %, encadenando así tres años consecutivos de crecimiento.

Europa ha sido el principal motor de estos resultados. En el continente, Renault alcanzó el segundo puesto entre los fabricantes, con 1.004.000 vehículos vendidos. Las ventas de turismos crecieron un 7,4 %, muy por encima del crecimiento medio del mercado europeo, situado en el 2,3 %, lo que permitió a la marca alcanzar una cuota del 5,7 %.

Estas afirmaciones se produjeron en el contexto de sus dudas sobre la lealtad de la alianza atlántica, asegurando que Estados Unidos 'nunca ha necesitado' a la OTAN y que los aliados europeos no han respondido adecuadamente cuando se les ha requerido ayuda.

Políticos británicos de distintos partidos reaccionaron con dureza. La diputada laborista Emily Thornberry, presidenta del comité de asuntos exteriores, lo calificó de 'insulto absoluto' a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en el conflicto, destacando que el Reino Unido siempre ha respondido a las peticiones estadounidenses. El líder liberaldemócrata Sir Ed Davey cuestionó cómo se atrevía Trump a poner en duda el sacrificio de los caídos, recordand]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-critica-a-las-tropas-de-la-otan-por-mantenerse-alejadas-del-frente-en-afganistan-y-provoca-rechazo-en-reino-unido</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-critica-a-las-tropas-de-la-otan-por-mantenerse-alejadas-del-frente-en-afganistan-y-provoca-rechazo-en-reino-unido</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pedro Sánchez rechaza la participación de España en la Junta de Paz para Gaza de Trump y defiende la soberanía europea frente a las presiones de EEUU]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, intervino desde Bruselas tras la reunión del Consejo Europeo donde los líderes europeos abordaron las tensiones con Estados Unidos, especialmente por las pretensiones de Donald Trump sobre Groenlandia y su propuesta de una Junta de Paz para Gaza. Sánchez criticó duramente la postura estadounidense, afirmando que el Gobierno de EEUU no respeta el derecho internacional y está tensionando como nunca la relación transatlántica entre EEUU y la UE. Defendió que Europa debe fortalecerse internamente, invertir mejor y de forma unida en defensa y seguridad, y mostrarse como un bloque sólido ante cualquier amenaza o coacción. Subrayó que la UE tomará las medidas necesarias para proteger su soberanía y que no se volverá a un pasado donde se juega con la soberanía de los países mediante amenazas comerciales o de otro tipo.

Los hechos tuvieron lugar sobre las 21:00 horas, cuando un hombre paseaba a su perro por la zona ajardinada de Las Glorietas de Goya. Al recriminar a un grupo de jóvenes por su comportamiento incívico, que incluía romper botellas y causar molestias, fue rodeado y agredido físicamente con patadas, puñetazos y el uso de cinturones. A pesar de la agresión, la víctima logró huir, aunque se percató de que le habían sustraído el teléfono móvil. Gracias a la rápida actuación de varias patrullas de Seguridad Ciudadana, se localizaron y detuvieron a los presuntos agresores. Los cinco menores fueron entregados a sus tutores legales, mientras que los dos adultos pasaron a disposición judicial y quedaron en libertad con cargos tras declarar por delitos de robo con violencia y lesiones.

La operación se desarrolló alrededor de las diez de la mañana en un edificio situado en la aldea de Meicende, donde el fugitivo llevaba varios meses residiendo con la intención de pasar desapercibido.

Durante el dispositivo policial, Vázquez Patiño ofreció una resistencia especialmente peligrosa. Según fuentes policiales citadas por ABC, intentó apuñalar a uno de los agentes del Grupo de Operaciones Especiales (GOE), una unidad de élite, y trató de huir escapando por el tejado del inmueble.

Gracias a ejemplares capturados antes del colapso y trasladados a cautiverio (principalmente descendientes de aves llevadas a EE.UU. en 1925), la especie sobrevive exclusivamente en programas de cría coordinados por zoológicos de Europa y Norteamérica. Actualmente, hay alrededor de 200 individuos en estas instalaciones, que actúan como una población de seguridad para preservar la diversidad genética y evitar la endogamia.

En el acto, Trump volvió a criticar duramente a España por ser, según él, el único aliado de la OTAN que no ha aceptado elevar el gasto en defensa al 5% del PIB, frente al objetivo previo del 2%. Acusó al país de querer 'aprovecharse' y advirtió: 'Vamos a tener que hablar con España'. Esta no es la primera vez que Trump presiona al Gobierno español por esta cuestión, ya que Pedro Sánchez ha rechazado en reiteradas ocasiones subir el gasto militar a esa cifra, argumentando que supondría recortes en servicios públicos y el Estado de bienestar.

Marín estudió pedagogía en castellano en la Universidad de Santiago de Chile y fue la primera universitaria de su familia.

Publicado en 'Scientific Reports', este avance permite detectar cambios en los patrones sísmicos del magma, lo que indica que se ha iniciado su ascenso hacia la superficie. Según los científicos, el magma sigue una 'memoria' que permanece estable mientras se encuentra estancado; cuando se produce un cambio en esa sismicidad, la erupción es inminente. Este sistema no solo avisa del inicio de la erupción, sino que también puede identificar cuándo el volcán comienza a perder fuerza, facilitando la planificación del retorno de la población evacuada y la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas.

Una táctica reciente y sorprendente consiste en emplear drones aéreos grandes como medio de transporte improvisado para llevar robots terrestres (UGV) pequeños hasta posiciones cercanas al enemigo, soltándolos en el lugar idóneo. De este modo se evitan los trayectos terrestres más peligrosos, plagados de minas, artillería, barro y detección enemiga, que causan numerosas bajas.

Esta innovación, descrita por mandos ucranianos y confirmada por la empresa Ark Robotics (que suministra robots a más de 20 brigadas), ha sorprendido incluso a sus propios fabricantes.

En la misiva, Robson califica esta omisión como un «secretismo» que no es solo un problema burocrático, sino algo profundamente personal para las víctimas, ya que perpetúa el mismo encubrimiento que permitió que los abusos continuaran durante años sin ser controlados. Además, subraya que la demora envía un mensaje doloroso: que la justicia no alcanza a las personas ricas y poderosas implicadas en los crímenes.

NonUSA ha alcanzado el primer puesto en la App Store danesa, tras partir del puesto 441. Estas herramientas permiten escanear códigos de barras o fotos de productos para determinar su país de origen, alertando si son fabricados en Estados Unidos y sugiriendo alternativas locales o europeas.

El fenómeno responde directamente a las repetidas declaraciones del presidente Donald Trump sobre la posible adquisición o mayor control estadounidense de Groenlandia, territorio autónomo bajo soberanía danesa. Estas afirmaciones han generado indignación en Dinamarca y Groenlandia, provocando protestas masivas en Copenhague y otras ciudades europeas con lemas como 'Greenland is not for sale' o 'Make America Go Away'.

La acusación principal es que el banco canceló unilateralmente varias cuentas bancarias de Trump por motivos políticos, tras el asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, cuando Trump alentó a sus seguidores a impedir la certificación de la victoria electoral de Joe Biden. La demanda, interpuesta en un tribunal estatal del condado de Miami-Dade (Florida), alega violación de los códigos éticos del banco, difamación comercial, incumplimiento del pacto de buena fe y trato justo, así como infracción de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales y Engañosas de Florida. Trump argumenta que la decisión de JP Morgan fue motivada por presiones políticas y sociales progresistas para distanciarse de sus opiniones conservadoras.

A través de varias publicaciones en Truth Social, Trump acusó a grandes medios de comunicación y empresas de encuestas de publicar resultados sesgados para perjudicar su presidencia. En concreto, criticó la encuesta conjunta del New York Times y el Siena College Research Institute, afirmando que estaba inclinada a favor de los demócratas y anunciando acciones legales para exigir que se conserven los registros internos de la encuesta. Según estas encuestas recientes, su aprobación se encuentra en torno al 35-40%, con un desaprobación superior al 60%, reflejando un debilitamiento notable incluso en áreas donde Trump solía mostrar fortaleza, como economía, inmigración y seguridad fronteriza. Trump argumenta que existen encuestas favorables a su gestión que no se publican y que los medios utilizan los sondeos como herramienta política]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cuestiona-encuestas-desfavorables-tras-registrar-su-menor-aprobacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cuestiona-encuestas-desfavorables-tras-registrar-su-menor-aprobacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maria Machado propone intervenciones militares en Cuba y Nicaragua tras el caso de Venezuela, desatando críticas en redes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Maria Corina Machado, galardonada con el Premio Nobel de la Paz en 2025 y líder de la oposición venezolana, ha generado una fuerte polémica tras declarar públicamente que Estados Unidos debería intervenir militarmente en Cuba y Nicaragua de forma similar a la reciente operación en Venezuela, donde se capturó al presidente Nicolás Maduro y su esposa. Durante su visita a Washington y reuniones con legisladores estadounidenses, Machado defendió que la liberación de Venezuela era solo el primer paso hacia la eliminación del comunismo y la dictadura en América Latina. Sus comentarios provocaron críticas inmediatas en redes sociales, donde muchos usuarios la calificaron de hipócrita y cuestionaron su idoneidad para recibir el Nobel de la Paz. Algunos la acusaron de fomentar el belicismo y de confundir la libertad con la justificación de intervenciones militares. Este episodio se produce después de que Machado entregara su medalla del Nobel al expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump como mue]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/maria-machado-propone-intervenciones-militares-en-cuba-y-nicaragua-tras-el-caso-de-venezuela-desatando-criticas-en-redes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/maria-machado-propone-intervenciones-militares-en-cuba-y-nicaragua-tras-el-caso-de-venezuela-desatando-criticas-en-redes</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El movimiento de solidaridad con la huelga de Minneapolis contra ICE se extiende a más de 100 ciudades en EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[Payday Report está siguiendo de cerca el creciente movimiento de huelgas y acciones de solidaridad en todo Estados Unidos en respuesta a la ocupación de ICE en Minneapolis. Según su mapa interactivo, ya hay acciones programadas en al menos 120 ciudades del país para apoyar la huelga general convocada en Minnesota. Esta movilización surge tras el llamamiento de la Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation, la Minnesota AFL-CIO y otras federaciones sindicales importantes del estado, que han declarado el viernes como 'Día de la Verdad y la Libertad'. Los trabajadores planean parar y salir a la calle en protesta. Keiran Knutson, presidente de CWA Local 7520 y uno de los líderes del movimiento, estima que decenas de miles de personas participarán en las calles de las Twin Cities.

Ante la negativa de la Fiscalía a incorporar como prueba mensajes de WhatsApp que, según él, desmienten las acusaciones, ha decidido publicar capturas de dichas conversaciones en su cuenta de Instagram. El objetivo es demostrar la supuesta falsedad de las denuncias y mostrar una relación cordial con las exempleadas durante y después de su empleo.

Sin embargo, esta acción podría acarrearle consecuencias legales. La Constitución Española protege el secreto de las comunicaciones (artículo 18), y el artículo 197 del Código Penal tipifica como delito la revelación de secretos o la vulneración de la intimidad sin consentimiento, especialmente si afecta al honor, la reputación o la imagen, con penas que pueden incluir prisión de tres meses a un año o multas.

García Ramírez declaró que la entonces consellera y mando único de la emergencia, Salomé Pradas, le comunicó su intención de reventar una presa y confinar toda la provincia, ante lo que él le aconsejó consultar a la Abogacía de la Generalitat debido a que tal decisión podría afectar derechos fundamentales. Según García Ramírez, desconocía por qué fue llamado para esa consulta, ya que es economista y no experto en derecho. Las conversaciones con Pradas retrasaron el envío del Es Alert, que había sido presentado previamente en el Cecopi. Durante la jornada de la dana, García Ramírez trasladó al jefe de gabinete de Carlos Mazón, José Manuel Cuenca, a Xàtiva y desde el Palau se dedicó a elaborar un decreto de ayudas para los afectados por el desbordamiento del río Magro en Utiel.
