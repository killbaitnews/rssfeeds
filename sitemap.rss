According to newly unsealed court documents, Alexander claims Baldoni discussed sexual encounters with women in a manner that made Alexander feel uneasy and distracted while driving. Alexander stated that Baldoni’s comments included suggestions that women had 'forced themselves' on him and that he had 'forced himself' on women, which Alexander described as disturbing. This interaction occurred during their first meeting and reportedly prompted Alexander to immediately inform Lively of his discomfort. These allegations appear amid ongoing legal proceedings between Lively and Baldoni. Lively has filed complaints with the California Department of Civil Rights and a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and misconduct on set, while Baldoni has denied all allegations and had previously filed a countersuit that w]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/driver-reports-unsettling-conversation-with-justin-baldoni-during-it-ends-with-us-production</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/driver-reports-unsettling-conversation-with-justin-baldoni-during-it-ends-with-us-production</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Allegations of Severe Abuse and Torture at Fort Bliss ICE Detention Facility in Texas]]></title><description><![CDATA[According to a December 2025 letter by the ACLU of Texas, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights groups, detainees at Fort Bliss, Texas, have reported severe abuse and sexual torture by ICE officers. The facility, also known as Camp East Montana, currently houses over 2,700 people, making it the largest immigration detention center in the United States. Sworn declarations from detainees describe officers crushing testicles, slamming heads into walls, sexual assault, verbal humiliation, and denying access to medical care and lawyers. One teenager, identified as 'Samuel,' described being beaten unconscious, having his tooth broken, and suffering severe testicular and ear injuries. Another detainee, 'Isaac,' reported similar sexual abuse and threats of forced deportation to countries they had no ties to. The tent camp was opened in August 2025 despite warnings of potential humanitarian disaster. Human rights groups argue these abuses violate both U.S. civil and criminal law as well as]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/allegations-of-severe-abuse-and-torture-at-fort-bliss-ice-detention-facility-in-texas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/allegations-of-severe-abuse-and-torture-at-fort-bliss-ice-detention-facility-in-texas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israeli Soldiers Accused of Abusing Palestinian Detainee Receive Public Support at Court Hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a controversial court hearing in Jerusalem in which two Israeli soldiers accused of sexually assaulting a Palestinian detainee were greeted with applause from supporters inside the courtroom. The soldiers are among five members of an Israeli military unit charged with aggravated assault following an incident at the Sde Teiman detention camp in July 2024. A leaked video from the incident shows soldiers beating a Palestinian prisoner and later gang-raping him behind riot shields. The detainee was hospitalized with severe internal injuries and long-term trauma.

The court hearing did not focus on the alleged assault itself, but rather on a dispute over who should lead the investigation into the leak of the video footage. The leak sparked a major political and institutional scandal in Israel, ultimately leading to the resignation and arrest of the army’s former chief legal adviser, Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi. Right-wing politicians and commentators accused her of harming]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israeli-soldiers-accused-of-abusing-palestinian-detainee-receive-public-support-at-court-hearing</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/israeli-soldiers-accused-of-abusing-palestinian-detainee-receive-public-support-at-court-hearing</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Evangeline Lilly discusses the personal and financial challenges of recovering from a traumatic brain injury]]></title><description><![CDATA[Evangeline Lilly has opened up about the profound physical, emotional, and financial impact of recovering from a traumatic brain injury sustained after an accident last year. In a video shared on Instagram, the actor described fainting at a beach in May and falling face-first onto a boulder, an incident that resulted in a concussion and later a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury. Since then, she says her cognitive functioning has been noticeably affected, prompting her to seek extensive evaluations and highly specialized treatment.

Lilly explained that her recovery has required significant financial resources, as she pursued expert assessments and customized care tailored specifically to her condition. She was careful to acknowledge that her ability to access such treatment is tied to her financial means, emphasizing that many people do not have the same opportunities when it comes to quality healthcare. Throughout the video, she repeatedly clarified that she is not a medical profess]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evangeline-lilly-discusses-the-personal-and-financial-challenges-of-recovering-from-a-traumatic-brain-injury</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evangeline-lilly-discusses-the-personal-and-financial-challenges-of-recovering-from-a-traumatic-brain-injury</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Allegations of Abuse and Neglect at ICE Detention Center in Fort Bliss, Texas]]></title><description><![CDATA[US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is under intense scrutiny after reports surfaced of severe mistreatment of migrants at Fort Bliss, Texas. The facility, historically used as a WWII Japanese internment camp, is accused of widespread abuse, including physical beatings, sexual assault, and denial of basic necessities such as food, hygiene supplies, and medical care. A 19-page investigative report supported by the ACLU and Human Rights Watch documents over 80 violations of federal standards, including incidents where detainees were tortured to coerce deportation. Deaths in ICE custody have reached a 20-year high, further escalating concerns. Activists emphasize that detainees are often denied legal representation, restricting their ability to challenge abuse or detention. Conditions at the center include overcrowded tents, exposure to raw sewage, and lack of essential medications. Advocates argue that the facility mirrors the harsh conditions of its WWII-era internment operatio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/allegations-of-abuse-and-neglect-at-ice-detention-center-in-fort-bliss-texas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/allegations-of-abuse-and-neglect-at-ice-detention-center-in-fort-bliss-texas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Republican leaders demand investigation after federal agents kill Minneapolis protester]]></title><description><![CDATA[A fatal shooting in Minneapolis has triggered rare and increasingly public criticism of President Donald Trump and federal law enforcement agencies from within the Republican Party. The incident involved the death of Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse and U.S. citizen who was active in recent protests. According to federal authorities, Pretti was described as a dangerous domestic threat. However, widely shared video footage appears to contradict that claim, showing that he had been disarmed and restrained when federal agents fired multiple shots.

The killing has reignited debate over the conduct, training, and oversight of federal immigration enforcement. Several Republican officials have expressed alarm that the actions of federal agents may have violated constitutional protections and eroded public trust. Vermont Governor Phil Scott issued one of the strongest rebukes, stating that it is unacceptable for Americans to be killed by federal agents while exercising their constitutional right to ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/republican-leaders-demand-investigation-after-federal-agents-kill-minneapolis-protester</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/republican-leaders-demand-investigation-after-federal-agents-kill-minneapolis-protester</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Obama Calls for Accountability After Fatal Shootings in Minnesota]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this article, former President Barack Obama addresses the tragic killing of Alex Pretti and emphasizes that it should serve as a wake-up call for all Americans. He highlights concerns over federal law enforcement and immigration agents acting outside of the law in Minnesota, including tactics perceived as intimidating and dangerous. Obama criticizes the current administration for escalating tensions rather than promoting accountability and collaboration with state and local officials, which could prevent further tragedies. He stresses the importance of lawful, transparent, and cooperative policing, urging officials to work constructively with Governor Walz, Mayor Frey, and local police. Additionally, Obama encourages citizens to support peaceful protests and to actively speak out against injustice, protect fundamental freedoms, and hold the government accountable.

For over a thousand years, it operated as an autonomous monastic republic with its own laws, recognized historically by Byzantine emperors, Ottoman sultans, Greek kings, and even the European Union. A rule called 'avaton', established in 1046, prohibited the entry of women to preserve the monks’ spiritual focus. Female animals were also banned to prevent distractions, although some, like cats and hens, were allowed for practical reasons. Interestingly, Catalans were historically banned due to a violent conflict in 1305 known as the 'Catalan Revenge'. Following the assassination of Roger de Flor and the massacre of Catalan mercenaries, the survivors retaliated brutally against the Byzantine Empire, including looting monasteries on Mount Athos. As a result, Catalans were collectively prohibited from entering the peninsula for centuries.

She shared a photograph of herself holding a cup of coffee and wrote about the importance of slowing down, prioritizing what truly matters, and taking moments for rest and self-reflection. Gilbert thanked supporters for their patience and encouragement, noting that their support helped her feel grounded and secure. She also mentioned that she would be gradually returning to her work and online presence, approaching it thoughtfully and cautiously. Busfield surrendered to authorities on January 13 and faces two counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and one count of child abuse.

Unlike modern machines or ice dispensers, this method emphasizes a hands-on, tactile experience that transforms large, rigid ice blocks into soft, crushed ice perfect for beverages like mojitos, mint juleps, and whiskey cocktails. The process is described as both therapeutic and ceremonious, allowing drink makers to engage with the ingredients and enhance the overall hospitality experience. By manually breaking down ice, the surface area increases, which not only improves the drink's texture but also its flavor and social appeal. The article highlights the simplicity and charm of the wooden mallet and canvas bag combination, priced at $24.99, presenting it as a small investment for a more enjoyable and elegant cocktail-making ritual. Overall, it celebrates the beauty of slow, artisanal practices in an era dominated by fast, soulless machines, emphasizing how small detai]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-to-crush-ice-elegantly-for-cocktails-using-a-mallet-and-lewis-bag</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-to-crush-ice-elegantly-for-cocktails-using-a-mallet-and-lewis-bag</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 08:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alaska / Hawaiian Airlines Atmos Summit Visa Infinite Card Returns 100K Points Offer]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Alaska / Hawaiian Airlines Atmos Summit Visa Infinite card is once again offering a high-value bonus of 100,000 Atmos points, which expired last fall.

Estimated at around four trillion euros and unfolding over the current and next decade, this transfer is described as one of the largest movements of private wealth in Spain’s recent history. Spanish banks view the process as a major business opportunity, competing aggressively to attract the new profile of the ‘millennial heir’: digitally savvy, suddenly wealthy, and potentially loyal to new financial products.

Beyond its immediate financial implications, the article stresses the broader economic and social risks associated with this phenomenon. Citing warnings from economists and institutions such as the OECD, it argues that while the wealth transfer may stimulate sectors like luxury consumption, home renovation, and premium financial services, it is also likely to int]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-in-spain-and-its-economic-and-social-consequences</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-intergenerational-wealth-transfer-in-spain-and-its-economic-and-social-consequences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Blue Gemini Program: The US Military’s 1960s Space Capsule Project]]></title><description><![CDATA[Blue Gemini was a United States Air Force project in the 1960s that aimed to use a modified Gemini spacecraft for military purposes in low Earth orbit. Originally, the Gemini program was a NASA initiative, conceived as Mercury Mark II, to develop orbital docking and extravehicular activities before the Apollo missions. While NASA considered Gemini as a preparatory step toward Apollo, the military saw it as an opportunity to explore space operations for potential orbital stations. In 1962, the Blue Gemini program was launched to support MODS (Manned Orbital Development System), a planned military space station, which later evolved into the MOL (Manned Orbital Laboratory) featuring reconnaissance capabilities including the KH-10 DORIAN telescope. The program planned multiple missions, initially including both NASA and Air Force astronauts, with tasks such as docking with Agena targets, testing the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit, reconnaissance, and deployment of equipment.

The legislation, co-sponsored by Boebert and Republican Jeff Hurd alongside two Democratic senators, aimed to extend loan repayment deadlines for Colorado towns building a crucial water pipeline. The bill had passed unanimously in both chambers of Congress. Trump vetoed it, arguing that it would extend federal taxpayer responsibility for local costs and perpetuate inefficient policies. Boebert condemned the veto as a betrayal of constituents’ needs, noting that it denied clean drinking water to thousands of Coloradans who had supported the president in all three of his elections. She added that she hoped the decision was not political retaliation for her support of a measure demanding the release of the Epstein files.

Approximately 400,000 custom bricks were hand-cut to create a seamless and immersive experience that feels rooted in the neighborhood while maintaining a futuristic, almost science-fiction aesthetic. In the central space, dark blue steel elements contrast with the brick, inspired by blinds to open sightlines and prevent the masonry from feeling too heavy.

Johnson, 44, allegedly abused a victim over several months beginning in 2024 in Hernando County. Court filings indicate that he attempted to silence the victim by offering a financial payout and referencing his Trump pardon, claiming he would include the victim in his will. Previously, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges related to the Capitol riot, including breaking into a Senate meeting room and menacing police, and was sentenced to one year in prison in August 2024, a sentence later wiped out by the pardon. He was arrested in July 2025 and remains in custody ahead of his trial scheduled for February 9, 2026. Johnson has pleaded not guilty.

She reports that these judicial processes aim to demoralize and financially exhaust activists, forcing many to abandon their movements due to stress, legal costs, and fear of criminal records that can jeopardize visas, scholarships, or jobs. According to Gari, accusations of 'assaulting police' frequently target those who were in fact victims of police violence, while acts such as chanting banned slogans, wearing Palestinian symbols, or even defending oneself during arrests are treated as criminal offenses.

OS maps provide planners and developers with a detailed understanding of a site's location, surroundings, topography, boundaries, and environmental features, enabling informed decision-making from the early stages. These maps allow professionals to visualize constraints, assess feasibility, and comply with regulations, reducing costly errors and rework. They also facilitate stakeholder collaboration by offering a common visual reference for engineers, surveyors, and architects, which minimizes misunderstandings.

Zhang Youxia, the country's highest-ranking military officer and a close ally of President Xi Jinping. Authorities allege that Zhang disclosed sensitive details about China's nuclear weapons program to the United States during a high-level briefing attended by senior military leaders. The accusations also include accepting bribes for official actions, such as promoting an officer named Gu to the position of defense minister. This probe follows a surprise announcement on Saturday, highlighting serious breaches of party discipline and state law. Zhang, aged 75, was once seen as Xi's most trusted military figure, making his potential downfall significant for China's leadership stability. The briefing linked Zhang to a security breach in the nuclear sector stemming from the investigation into Gu, though specific details of the leaked information remain undisclosed.

According to the piece, Washington is moving away from overextended global commitments and focusing instead on self-preservation and cost efficiency. The new U.S. national defense policy, presented by the Pentagon, signals a shift in how the country relates to its traditional allies, pressing them to take on greater responsibility for their own defense. This adjustment comes as the U.S. faces internal challenges and a new global balance of power that limits its capacity to act as the world’s primary security guarantor. 

In practice, this strategy involves cuts to certain aid programs, relocating military bases, adjusting joint exercises, and tightening budgets. Economically, the U.S. government is prioritizing domestic production and key strategic industries to counter economic instability, while stricter immigration con]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-the-u-s-economic-crisis-is-reshaping-its-military-strategy</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-the-u-s-economic-crisis-is-reshaping-its-military-strategy</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marjorie Taylor Greene Warns Against Political Polarization After Minnesota Shooting]]></title><description><![CDATA[Former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) spoke out following a controversial incident in Minnesota where a federal immigration agent fatally shot a man named Alex Pretti. Greene expressed her support for law enforcement and immigration control but emphasized her defense of the Second Amendment, stating that legally carrying a firearm does not equate to brandishing one. She also underscored the importance of First and Fourth Amendment rights, particularly the rights to protest peacefully and record public events.

In her comments posted on X, Greene urged supporters of former President Donald Trump to imagine how they might respond if similar events occurred under a Democratic administration. She drew parallels between the Minnesota shooting and how the FBI handled January 6 rioters, arguing that the public often interprets law enforcement actions based on partisan lines. Greene warned that such divisions are fueling hostility and could push the nation toward civil conflict. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marjorie-taylor-greene-warns-against-political-polarization-after-minnesota-shooting</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marjorie-taylor-greene-warns-against-political-polarization-after-minnesota-shooting</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NATO Chief Rutte: Europe Depends on US for Defense Against Global Threats]]></title><description><![CDATA[NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized to the European Parliament that Europe cannot effectively defend itself without the support of the United States. Rutte stated bluntly that anyone believing the European Union or Europe as a whole can manage its defense independently is 'dreaming.' His remarks come shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump lifted tariffs on the EU and reached preliminary agreements with NATO regarding Greenland. Rutte explained that two workstreams were agreed upon with the U.S. to address tensions and strategic concerns in Greenland. The first involves NATO taking a larger role in Arctic defense to collectively counter the influence of Russia and China. The second workstream is a trilateral discussion between the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland, which NATO will not be part of.

It draws heavily on insights from Andrej Karpathy, former Tesla AI lead, who describes the 'march of nines'—each increment in reliability requiring enormous additional effort. Karpathy cautions that while demos may impress, turning them into safe, scalable products takes years due to the immense complexity and high cost of failure. The piece highlights that most major players in the self-driving industry, including Cruise, Uber, Aurora, Apple, and others, have either folded, pivoted, or scaled back their ambitions, suggesting widespread recognition that autonomy remains an unsolved technological and economic challenge.

Waymo, despite being a leader, still relies on human teleoperation—a system called 'fleet response'—to handle situations its software cannot manage.

Habitat destruction, such as the conversion of diverse forests into monoculture plantations or agricultural fields, results in acoustically impoverished environments with reduced layers of frequencies, melodies, and temporal patterns. Species extinctions have permanently silenced unique voices, including those of the Kauaʻi ʻōʻō bird and Rabbs’ fringe-limbed treefrog, while massive declines in populations of vocal marine species like whales and fish (e.g., over 99% drop in some cod populations and the killing of millions of whales in the 20th century) have erased distinctive aquatic soundscapes, replaced by industrial noises from ships and seismic activities.

Following her relocation to Spain after the widely televised defamation trial between her and Johnny Depp, Heard largely withdrew from public life to care for her three children — twins Agnes and Ocean, and her eldest, Oonagh. Her long silence sparked curiosity, as she had been under intense scrutiny throughout and after the legal proceedings that concluded with her ordered to pay Depp one million dollars in damages, which he later donated to charity. Heard’s public return took place at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival with the premiere of 'Silenced,' directed by Selina Miles. The film explores how women who speak out publicly are often discredited or punished, framing such experiences as part of a broader global issue. Although the film’s themes echo elements of Heard’s own history, she made it clear in interviews that the project is not about her.

Following escalations in U.S.-Canada trade disputes, including tariff threats on Canadian goods like aluminum, lumber, and agriculture, combined with provocative political statements—such as suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state—many Canadians have chosen to avoid travel to Florida and other U.S. destinations. This shift has led to a reported loss of around 280,000 tourism-related jobs in Florida, encompassing roles in hospitality, restaurants, real estate, and support services, with some estimates suggesting the figure could be higher when including indirect impacts. Economic losses are estimated at over $52 billion, with winter tourism occupancy rates plummeting in key areas.

The offer runs from January 25, 2026, through January 31, 2026, with a stated limit of 10 transactions per household or business, though individual store policies may vary and impose stricter limits. Shoppers are advised to purchase in multiples of three $200 (or similar) Visa gift cards to maximize the discount—for example, spending $600 yields $30 off, while $900 yields $45 off, and larger amounts like $3000 could potentially yield $150 off depending on store tolerance. Each $200 Visa gift card carries a $7.95 activation fee, so three cards incur $23.85 in fees, resulting in a net profit of $6.15 after the discount, plus any credit card rewards earned on the purchase.

First, Saks Global, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, has filed for bankruptcy, raising concerns about the status of Saks gift cards. A judge has ruled that the retailer may continue honoring its gift cards without violating bankruptcy law, and Saks has confirmed its intention to do so. However, customers remain uneasy about holding gift cards from a bankrupt company. If Saks eventually decides to halt the program, a two-week notice must be provided before termination.

The second topic examines findings from an American Express infographic that revealed the top three Membership Rewards redemption categories among cardholders: gift cards, points used at checkout, and statement credits.

Traditionally, self-reported happiness follows a U-shaped curve, with higher levels in youth and older age and a dip in middle adulthood. However, newer data shows that young people's flourishing scores now start low due to rising mood disorders and remain depressed until middle age, altering the classic pattern. This trend is global but more pronounced in affluent, secular societies. Key factors include declining religious attendance, which boosts flourishing measures by about 8% on average worldwide and even more in rich countries, and a corresponding loss of meaning and purpose—ironically, higher GDP per capita correlates with weaker senses of life's worthwhileness.

Curated by Connie Hüsser, the exhibition brings together the work of more than 75 designers who were invited to rethink the concept of home on a miniature scale. Rather than functioning purely as shelters for birds, the resulting designs act as small but powerful reflections on architecture, identity, and emotional attachment to place.

The birdhouses vary widely in style and intention. Some resemble traditional cabins or modernist dwellings, while others embrace fantasy, humor, fragility, or nostalgia. This diversity underscores the exhibition’s central idea: that home is not defined by a single form, aesthetic, or size, but by feeling, care, and imagination. By reducing architecture to something handheld, the designers strip away grandeur and excess, leaving behind core ideas such as protection, comfort, playfulness, and]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/designers-explore-the-meaning-of-home-through-75-experimental-birdhouses-at-mad-brussels</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/designers-explore-the-meaning-of-home-through-75-experimental-birdhouses-at-mad-brussels</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pentagon Announces Partial Withdrawal of U.S. Officers and Troops from NATO Structures in Europe]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that the Pentagon has informed its European allies of its decision to withdraw officers from nearly 30 NATO operational mechanisms and to partially reduce its troop presence on Europe’s eastern flank. This move, which primarily affects countries like Romania, is portrayed as a major shift marking the decline of transatlantic solidarity that began in 1945. Romania, one of the first countries impacted, has confirmed the withdrawal of a substantial portion of the U.S. contingent stationed on its territory. The report situates this move within a broader pattern of U.S. military restructuring in both Africa and Europe. The withdrawal affects NATO deployments that were reinforced after 2014, following the political crisis in Ukraine, when the alliance expanded its presence along Russia’s borders.

The tanker, reportedly operating under multiple names—'Grinch' on the UK’s sanction list and 'Carl' on those of the EU and the U.S.—was seized and taken to the port of Marseille. The publication argues that France’s justification, claiming the ship was under international sanctions and sailing under a false flag, is misleading, contending that such unilateral sanctions contradict international law. It describes the seizure as an act of piracy and points out that ship reflagging is a common maritime practice used for reasons like tax advantages, labor regulations, and port access, not concealment.

The buildings emphasize restraint, precision, and calm aesthetics, avoiding flashy elements in favor of a thoughtful, understated presence. Interiors are warm and light-filled, dominated by wood that conveys craftsmanship, comfort, and a timeless quality, softening the rugged mountain environment.

A parliamentary majority appears ready to support the proposal, although many lawmakers criticize its complexity and potential impact on investors. The reform targets the so-called Box 3 asset tax, which had been based on assumed returns rather than actual investment performance — a system the courts ruled unfair. Under the new model, investors would pay tax on both realized and unrealized gains, meaning profits from stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies would be taxed even before assets are sold. This approach has sparked concern across the political spectrum, as many parties consider it unreasonable to tax theoretical, non-liquid earnings. Still, caretaker State Secretary for Taxation Eugène Heijnen argued that taxing only realized gains is not feasible before 2028 and delaying further would cost the treasury about €2.3 billion per year.

The authors developed a robust tree-ring chronology and correlated it with high-resolution precipitation datasets, achieving a strong relationship between annual ring growth and rainfall over a 320-day window from August to June. Their reconstruction shows substantial long-term variation in precipitation patterns since 1505 CE and, notably, a distinct intensification of both droughts and wet extremes since the late twentieth century.

These demands include providing the Department of Justice with the state's voter registration records, repealing sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, and sharing records related to Medicaid and Food and Nutrition Service programs. Bondi justified the request by citing a claimed 1,300 percent increase in violence against ICE officers and a 3,200 percent rise in vehicular attacks on federal agents, attributing the unrest to rhetoric from Minnesota officials, including Walz's description of federal agents as 'Trump's modern-day Gestapo' and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey's strong anti-ICE statements.

Vance during donor meetings. According to the tapes, Cruz expressed frustration over Trump’s tariff strategy, warning that it could badly damage the U.S. economy by reducing 401(k) values and raising prices. He told donors that he and several senators held a heated call with Trump after the tariffs were announced, describing the exchange as angry and unproductive. Trump allegedly responded to Cruz’s warnings with profanity. Cruz also mocked Trump’s labeling of the tariffs as “Liberation Day” and admitted he banned the term within his team. In addition to economic policy, Cruz targeted Vice President Vance, portraying him as heavily influenced by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson. He accused Vance and Carlson of pushing anti-interventionist policies, un]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ted-cruz-privately-criticizes-trump-s-trade-policies-and-vp-vance-in-leaked-recordings</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ted-cruz-privately-criticizes-trump-s-trade-policies-and-vp-vance-in-leaked-recordings</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 09:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rise of Private Corporations in Modern Warfare: The Case of SpaceX]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses the growing privatization of warfare, emphasizing how private corporations, rather than state militaries alone, have become active participants in conflicts. Traditionally, wars were fought by national armies financed by public budgets, with private companies merely supplying materials. However, this dynamic has shifted as war becomes a profitable business. A key example presented is Elon Musk’s company SpaceX, which has entered into deep cooperation with U.S. military and intelligence agencies. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2021 SpaceX signed a secret $1.8 billion contract with the U.S. government, representing a major portion of its total revenue. The company conducts satellite launches for the U.S. Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office and has created 'Starshield,' a government-focused version of its Starlink network, with the Pentagon as its first client.

The naval strike group is also supported by EA-18 Growler electronic warfare aircraft designed to neutralize enemy air defenses. Complementing this, the U.S. Air Force has deployed F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft, and F-15E Strike Eagles being sent toward Jordan. In addition, cargo planes such as C-17 Globemaster III and aerial refueling KC-135 Stratotankers are supporting the operation logistically.

However, many municipal boundaries are highly irregular due to historical processes such as the Reconquista, property-based divisions in the 19th century, annexations, secessions, and border disputes. The article highlights several notable examples of absurd municipal shapes across the country. San Sebastián has three exclaves in Gipuzkoa, including Zubieta (shared with Usúrbil), Landarbaso, and Urdaburu, resulting from historical separations and old mountain delineations. Guadalajara includes a large exclave at Usanos and a distant oak forest area. Noreña in Asturias consists of five separate enclaves entirely within Siero, stemming from 19th-century land ownership patterns. Montiel in Ciudad Real is fragmented into disconnected pieces, some connected by narrow corridors, due to medieval orders and later secessions.

Experts, including Professor Helen Roy from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology and the University of Exeter, attribute this boom to several favourable conditions. A mild winter allowed many ladybirds to emerge successfully from hibernation, followed by a dry spring that produced high numbers of aphids—the primary food source for many ladybird species. Subsequent warm, humid summer weather and heatwaves enabled the new generation to thrive, complete their life cycles quickly, and multiply rapidly. While some sightings involve the invasive harlequin ladybird, which tends to cluster in large groups indoors or on structures, most are harmless native species like the seven-spot ladybird.

According to the governor, reducing medical debt is a vital step toward fulfilling what she calls the “Arizona Promise,” a vision of economic opportunity and dignity for all residents. 

This debt relief effort forms part of a larger $2 billion statewide program designed to cancel medical debt using American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds.

It highlights economic monopolization, particularly how three companies dominate agriculture and food distribution, stifling competition and turning daily life into profit opportunities for capital. Wages have stagnated despite rising productivity, forcing 8.4 million Americans into multiple jobs to survive, while employees at giants like Walmart and Amazon often rely on government food assistance. The piece traces the erosion of social safety nets to the Reagan era in the 1980s, including cuts to unemployment benefits, Social Security, and public education investment—such as introducing tuition fees at the previously free University of California system.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey held a press conference condemning the incident, questioning the ongoing federal operations and asking rhetorically how many more Americans need to die or be seriously harmed for such actions to end. He urged the administration to withdraw federal forces from the city.

The gathering aimed to condemn recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests across Minnesota and call for an immediate end to local deportations. Organizers directed their message to airlines such as Delta and Signature Aviation, urging them to stop cooperating with ICE deportation flights. Protesters highlighted that around 2,000 individuals have been deported through the airport and that even airport workers have been detained by immigration agents. 

Roughly 100 clergy members joined the demonstration, singing, praying, and sharing personal stories of those affected by detention. Among the arrested was Reverend Mariah Tollgaard of Hamline Church United Methodist in St. Paul, who described her participation as a moral and religious act of solidarity with neighbors targeted by federal enforcement.

The narrative paints a vivid picture of life shaped by the sea, where landscapes and communities have been molded by centuries of maritime tradition. In Norway, small fishing villages near Bergen are described as timeless places where daily life follows the rhythm of tides and seasons. The sound of seagulls, the scent of fresh herring, and the warmth of winter wood stoves illustrate how deeply connected locals are to nature’s cycles. The author highlights the experience of traveling by train, where the Norwegian countryside unfolds from rugged mountains to tranquil fjords, reinforcing the idea of slow, mindful travel. Moving south into Sweden, the tone softens with depictions of pastel-colored archipelago towns and cobblestone lanes leading to harbors alive with gentle movement.

The narrative begins in Lisbon, describing its blend of ancient and contemporary architecture—from Alfama’s winding, tile-lined alleys to Bairro Alto’s balance of aged facades and modern galleries. The piece highlights how the city’s layers of history manifest where centuries-old churches stand beside sleek museums, shaping the capital’s unique skyline. 

The journey then moves north by train, showcasing Portugal’s scenic interior filled with vineyards, olive groves, and flowing rivers. In Porto, the Douro River divides a vibrant landscape where baroque churches and former wine lodges coexist with today’s lively cultural scene. The Ribeira district, rich in color and atmosphere, stands as a prime example of living history.

The report claims that this strategy resembles efforts previously seen in Venezuela and includes economic pressure tactics such as blocking shipments of Venezuelan oil to Cuba. The alleged objective is to weaken Cuba’s energy supply and accelerate a government collapse from within.

The article portrays the endeavor as part of what it calls a new 'destabilization manual'—a plan for a rapid and controlled political transition. It notes that no official U.S. documents confirm this strategy, implying that Washington is still studying its options. The piece also highlights Cuba’s diminished international support, particularly from Latin American allies such as Venezuela, whose own domestic crises have reduced assistance to Havana.

It explains that Denmark sold the Danish West Indies to the United States in exchange for $25 million in gold—equivalent to roughly $633 million today—creating what are now the U.S. Virgin Islands. The treaty also included a clause recognizing Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland. The piece then transitions to the history of Little Saint James, known as 'Epstein Island,' which Epstein purchased in 1998 through his company LSJ for a little over $10 million. The island, covering only a few hundred meters, became infamous as the main location for Epstein’s alleged crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors.

The Palestinian health ministry reported that their deaths raised the total number of casualties since the truce to 483, with more than 1,300 injured and 713 bodies recovered so far. The United Nations confirmed at least 216 additional Palestinian fatalities, including 46 children and 28 women, in Israeli strikes that occurred far from the front lines.

Eligible individuals can earn 125,000 Membership Rewards points after spending $15,000 within the first three months of card membership. This targeted promotion stands out because it lacks the standard 'once-per-lifetime' language that typically restricts welcome bonuses to those who have never held the card before. As a result, even people who currently hold or have previously held the Business Gold card may qualify if they receive the offer. The public standard offer for this card is generally 100,000 points after meeting similar spend requirements, making this 125,000-point version notably better for those targeted.

Since early January, around 2,000 ICE agents have been deployed to Minnesota, allegedly for a fraud investigation, but have instead been accused of violent and unlawful behavior, including fatal shootings and assaults against civilians. A federal judge has attempted to restrain their actions, yet the Trump administration has declared 'absolute immunity' for ICE agents and has opened criminal probes into Minnesota’s governor and Minneapolis’s mayor for obstructing federal enforcement. These moves have provoked mass resignations of U.S. attorneys and public outrage.

It highlights that, despite public claims of halting arms exports in mid‑2025, Germany continued to authorize and deliver military materials and technology used in the war, including tank components, submarines, and small arms. The report reveals that legal distinctions in German export law—between war weapons and military goods, or between defensive and offensive equipment—allowed the Merz government to maintain exports while appearing to impose restrictions. Investigations by NGOs such as the ECCHR suggest that German‑supplied weapons were used in operations that violated international humanitarian law, including the destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza.

The father had previously been removed from the U.S. and reentered illegally, according to DHS. Agents removed them from a parked car; the family’s attorney claims agents smashed the car windows in the driveway and prevented the father from handing the child to her mother, who was inside the home with other family members. Both have active asylum claims and no final removal orders. Within hours, the pair was transferred to Texas via commercial flight at 8:30 p.m. The family's attorney, Kira Kelley, filed an emergency petition for release around 5:37 p.m. and a motion to halt the transfer shortly after.

Sánchez announced plans to propose measures at the upcoming EU Council meeting to address these problems. Key proposals include ending anonymity on social media by requiring platforms to link user accounts to a European digital identity wallet, which would allow verification of real identities while potentially permitting pseudonyms.

BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology built into modern Windows computers and enabled by default, designed to prevent unauthorized access if a device is locked and powered off. However, Microsoft automatically uploads BitLocker recovery keys to its cloud, making them accessible to the company and, under certain circumstances, to law enforcement. According to Forbes, Microsoft receives an average of 20 requests per year for such recovery keys and sometimes complies.

Specifically, Abascal is accused of praising immigration raids conducted by U.S. authorities ('la migra'), viewing them as a model that could be replicated in Spain to deport large numbers of immigrants. The author frames U.S. anti-immigrant sentiment as rooted in fear among the Anglo-Saxon population of losing control of the state to a rapidly growing Hispanic demographic, which is unmatched by any other ethnic group in terms of population growth and cultural influence.

It embodies the deep connection between the city and its musical heritage. Built from hundreds of donated guitars collected through a citywide Guitar Amnesty, the work transforms these instruments—some pristine, others worn or broken—into a striking wooden pavilion that resonates with the collective memory of Manchester’s music scene. The sculpture goes beyond symbolism: it actively produces sound. A wind-activated system plucks the embedded guitar strings, allowing the structure to play itself in response to changes in the weather. Thus, the artwork becomes a living instrument, performing an ever-shifting symphony of subtle tones.

The photos were taken in remote areas including Crater Lake in Oregon, Mount Baker, and California’s Bristlecone pine forests. Each picture represents hours of preparation, patience, and technical precision. Working through long, cold nights, Johnson adjusts his camera settings in total darkness using long exposures to gather as much starlight as possible.

K. had claimed 'combatant privilege,' arguing that his alleged actions were those of a Ukrainian soldier targeting enemy infrastructure amid war with Russia. The BGH ruled that this argument does not apply because the Nord Stream pipelines are considered civilian infrastructure and that covert operations without clear state affiliation, such as uniforms or formal orders, are excluded from combatant immunity under international law. 

The court confirmed that Serhii K. will face prosecution in Germany for violating the country’s internal security and sovereignty. He may also be investigated for war crimes due to the civilian nature of the target.

Bilt Cash introduces a separate rewards currency that cardholders earn at 4% on all non-housing purchases and an additional $50 in Bilt Cash for every 25,000 Bilt points accumulated in a calendar year. However, most Bilt Cash expires at the end of each year, with only $100 rolling over. The program lets users redeem Bilt Cash for 19 different 'coupon-like' benefits, ranging from point accelerators to small monthly credits for services such as Lyft, Grubhub, Walgreens, or hotel stays. These offers have varying restrictions, including usage limits, expiration dates, and membership tiers. The most valuable redemptions are considered the 1X points accelerator — which costs $200 Bilt Cash and applies to $5,000 in everyday spending — and the ability to unlock rewards on rent payments, where $30 in Bilt Cash allows users to earn points on $1,000 of rent.

The CRFB identifies six possible crisis scenarios stemming from unchecked debt growth: an austerity crisis marked by forced spending cuts and steep tax hikes that could cause a deep recession; a financial crisis triggered by collapsing investor confidence and soaring interest rates; an inflation crisis resulting from excessive money printing; a currency crisis involving a sharp decline in the dollar’s global value; a default crisis, though improbable, that would devastate international markets; and a gradual crisis characterized by long-term stagnation similar to ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-national-debt-reaches-100-of-gdp-as-watchdog-warns-of-potential-fiscal-crises</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropkick Murphys Express Support for Former Officer Michael Fanone After He Wears Band Shirt at Jack Smith Hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 22, 2026, former D.C.

Flores, one of seven individuals charged in the 2022 theft of valuable jewelry and watches from a Brink's truck near Los Angeles, faced up to 15 years in federal prison. Despite being a lawful permanent resident and released on bail, he was taken into ICE custody and subsequently opted for deportation to Chile during a hearing. The move, which occurred in December, has drawn criticism from prosecutors who were preparing for trial and victimized jewelry companies who demand answers.

Immediately after an incident, prioritize safety by moving out of danger, taking deep breaths to stay centered, and documenting the scene thoroughly with photos of damage, surroundings, road conditions, and involved parties.

He also highlighted an American Research Group poll showing an even lower 35% approval and over 60% disapproval, broadening his criticism to include mainstream media, television networks, and even some conservative outlets for allegedly suppressing positive surveys.

The investigation claims that Trump’s wealth has grown primarily through overseas business ventures, licensing deals, and particularly from cryptocurrency investments. While continuing to deny any direct involvement with the Trump Organization, Trump has been accused of intertwining his political influence with private business interests. The report notes new real estate developments in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam, both following significant diplomatic or policy interactions with those nations.

Starting February 18, 2026, bookings for Emirates first class will require at least Qantas Silver elite status or higher, excluding entry-level Bronze members entirely. Additionally, from March 31, 2026, Qantas will implement a new distance-based award chart specifically for Emirates redemptions, resulting in increases across cabins. Most first-class awards will rise by approximately 20%; for example, the popular fifth-freedom route from New York to Milan (over 4,000 miles one-way) will jump from 123,100 to 147,800 Qantas points one-way.

Lawrence claims that Republicans plan to pass the SAVE Act in the Senate at the last minute before the 2026 midterms, requiring proof of U.S. citizenship via documents like birth certificates or passports for voter registration. It argues this would disproportionately affect approximately 69 million American women who changed their names after marriage or divorce, as their current legal names often do not match birth certificates, leading to unverifiable status and inability to vote or update registrations. The piece highlights long processing times (weeks to months) for corrected documents, making last-minute fixes impossible, and portrays the timing as a deliberate strategy to suppress women's votes. It connects this to broader themes of control over women's autonomy, including abortion restrictions and historical conservative efforts against gender equality.

This statement follows his recent abandonment of plans to impose escalating tariffs (starting at 10% and rising to 25%) on goods from eight European nations—Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland—to pressure them over US desires for greater control or access to Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

However, it is a temporary state rather than a character flaw, and recovery involves gradual, realistic steps rather than sudden fixes. Key hurdles include low energy and motivation; the article emphasizes starting with small actions—like getting out of bed, opening a window, or completing one task—because waiting for motivation rarely works, and even minor progress can weaken depression's hold. Cognitively, depression distorts neutral events into personal failures, so gently questioning these thoughts—distinguishing facts from feelings—and considering positive overthinking can help. Isolation worsens the condition, making connection vital, even through low-effort interactions like sharing a laugh or sending a message, as human contact counters the brain's insistence on loneliness.

Many Russians now view the war as defensive against perceived Western hostility, fostering widespread anti-Western sentiment and national consolidation. Pride in Russia's resilience amid sanctions, combined with economic growth despite heavy restrictions, has boosted optimism and trust in the nation's viability. The war has spurred technological innovation, reinforced the social contract of state-provided services, low taxes, and public investment, which Russians see as superior to Western models.

The pair reportedly married in a secret ceremony at some point after the engagement, though the exact date has not been disclosed. The marriage lasted only months before the filing. King, 46, has emphasized privacy throughout this period, particularly concerning her two sons, James (12) and Leo (10), whom she shares with ex-husband Kyle Newman. Her previous marriage to Newman, which began in 2007, ended with a divorce filing in 2020 and finalizat]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jaime-king-s-husband-austin-sosa-files-for-divorce-following-secret-marriage</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jaime-king-s-husband-austin-sosa-files-for-divorce-following-secret-marriage</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israeli Government Funds Google Ads in UK Targeting Doctors Without Borders Charity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Israel's government is financing a paid advertising campaign on Google in the United Kingdom to discredit the medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF, or Médecins Sans Frontières). These sponsored ads appear prominently in search results for terms related to the charity and link to an official Israeli report dated December 2025, which accuses MSF of serious ethical violations in Gaza. The report criticizes MSF's publications for using terms such as 'genocide', 'genocidal war', and 'ethnic cleansing' to describe Israel's actions, claiming this constitutes a deliberate effort to delegitimize the state. It also suggests possible connections between MSF and groups like Islamic Jihad and the PFLP. This initiative forms part of Israel's broader strategy to curb the operations of humanitarian groups in Gaza amid the ongoing conflict, where MSF has delivered vital medical services in hospitals despite challenging conditions.

This paved the way for a trilateral working group meeting in Abu Dhabi on January 23, involving delegates from Russia (led by General Igor Kostioukov), Ukraine, and the United States—the first such direct three-party format since Russia's 2022 invasion. Kremlin advisor Yuri Ushakov described the talks as aimed at advancing a political-diplomatic resolution to the war, though he stressed no immediate ceasefire, with Russia continuing its military operations and insisting on territorial concessions based on prior Anchorage agreements as non-negotiable for lasting peace. A separate parallel discussion on economic issues, including sanctions relief, involves Witkoff and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. The format likely echoes indirect November 2025 meetings in Abu Dhabi.

This position was outlined ahead of a special European Council meeting in Brussels on July 17-18, 2020, where EU leaders discussed a €750 billion recovery package to aid economies hit by pandemic lockdowns. Rutte emphasized the need for concrete reform plans, including reductions in state spending such as pensions, improvements in budget management, and enhancements in areas like education, elderly care, and job markets, to ensure long-term fiscal stability and prevent future aid requests. He noted prior unfulfilled promises from these countries and France, insisting that member states should decide reform specifics but must initiate them before accessing grants.

Due to significant disparities in military resources, officials anticipate that American forces could seize key land and sea positions within two days to a week. Rather than attempting conventional defense, the strategy shifts to unconventional, insurgency-style tactics inspired by Afghan resistance against Soviet and later U.S.-led forces, including ambushes, sabotage, drone operations, hit-and-run attacks, and improvised explosives. The focus would be on small, mobile units and reservists inflicting ongoing casualties to make occupation costly and difficult. General Jennie Carignan, Chief of the Defence Staff, has publicly outlined plans to expand a volunteer reserve force to over 400,000 members, who could be mobilized for armed resistance or disruptions if the U.S. assumes an occupying role.

The initiative, formally unveiled during the World Economic Forum in Davos, aims to redefine how countries participate in global diplomacy. Member states may join the new organization freely for a temporary three-year term, but a permanent seat requires a payment of one billion dollars. This financial requirement creates a hierarchy among nations, contradicting the UN’s principle of sovereign equality. Several Western countries, including France, Norway, and Sweden, have rejected the proposal, arguing that it undermines the multilateral system established in 1945. China reaffirmed its support for the UN and criticized the move as destabilizing to international diplomatic balance.

Braided cables, often constructed from woven nylon or polyester, are known for their longevity and resistance to fraying and bending. The textured weave provides a firm grip and prevents tangling, making them ideal for travel and demanding work environments. Magnetic charging solutions, such as those offered by Statik, often leverage this design to enhance exterior strength without adding excessive weight. In contrast, silicone cables offer exceptional flexibility and heat resistance, remaining soft even in cold temperatures and minimizing the risk of kinking. Their smooth, rubber-like surface, while comfortable and easy to handle, can be prone to attracting dust and lint. Both types of cables typically utilize copper or aluminum wiring for electrical performance, which remains consistent regardless of the outer material.

She recalled how Elordi would often stay nearby during filming, observing her character, which she found initially unsettling but soon became accustomed to. Elordi, 28, echoed her sentiments, calling it a 'mutual obsession' and praising Robbie as an elite actor. The two actors’ on-set rituals, including playing Kate Bush’s song “Wuthering Heights” on the Moors, helped them embody the story’s intense emotions of love and longing.

She emphasized that with US support, the Americas could become free of communism, dictatorship, and related threats for the first time in history.

Approximately 13,500 such notices were planned for 2026, with many being annual renewals from previous years and no immediate impact during peacetime.

Specifically, there were 47% more sellers than buyers—equating to roughly 631,000 additional sellers—with the number of active buyers dropping to just 1.34 million, the lowest figure in Redfin’s 12-year dataset and comparable to early pandemic lows in April 2020. This imbalance stems from buyers retreating due to persistently elevated home prices, mortgage rates hovering around 6%, recent layoffs, and broader economic and political uncertainties. The trend marks a complete reversal from the heated 2021 market, characterized by frequent bidding wars and buyers outnumbering sellers; the scales began tipping noticeably after February 2024.

Federal officials, including President Trump at a White House news conference, publicized a list of about 240 names, often accompanied by mugshots, to emphasize the severity of the threats posed by these individuals.

According to Macron, approximately €300 billion of European savings, which have historically been invested in the United States each year, will now be redirected to support investments within the European Union. This decision comes after a unanimous agreement among all 27 EU member states to establish the S&I Union, which represents a significant step toward creating a fully integrated European Capital Market. The move is expected to strengthen Europe's economic independence, increase investment opportunities within member states, and foster financial stability across the region. Experts suggest that by redirecting these funds, Europe could see enhanced funding for infrastructure projects, technological innovation, and sustainable development.

The author analyzes the failure of a specific rail section near a weld and suggests that the accident may not be an isolated incident but rather indicative of a structural problem. Observations indicate that thermal tension or pre-existing cracks were unlikely contributors, leaving possible welding defects or steel processing issues as likely causes. Beyond this individual failure, the article highlights broader issues with Spain's high-speed rail network, which was designed for lower traffic volumes and lighter trains. The network is now operating under stress from heavier trains and increased traffic, raising maintenance challenges that may be economically and operationally unsustainable. Possible solutions include reducing train weight and frequency or upgrading infrastructure to meet higher demands, both of which would be costly and could be perceived as a major setback]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/structural-challenges-threaten-spanish-high-speed-rail-network</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/structural-challenges-threaten-spanish-high-speed-rail-network</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kim Kardashian Clarifies Elephant-Skin Birkin Bag Was Fake Prop on 'All's Fair' Set, Regrets Not Addressing Backlash Sooner]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kim Kardashian recently addressed a viral controversy surrounding a Hermès Birkin bag that appeared to be made from elephant skin, which she carried while filming her Hulu legal drama series 'All's Fair.' The accessory sparked significant outrage in November 2025 from animal rights groups and celebrities like Ireland Baldwin, who called it 'disgusting and shameful,' due to ethical concerns over exotic animal materials in luxury fashion and Hermès' alleged past use of elephant hides from the 1980s. Initially, Kardashian remained silent, citing feeling overwhelmed by the negative reactions and concurrent scrutiny over her show. In a January 2026 episode of her sister Khloé Kardashian's podcast 'Khloé in Wonder Land,' she explained that the bag was not from her personal collection nor authentic. Instead, it was a prop brought in for wardrobe purposes during filming, along with other replica items left on set for convenience in styling scenes.

The bank estimates that tech companies and others will spend around $1 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures, including data centers, chips, and power grid enhancements, yet there is currently little tangible benefit or evidence of payoff. Drawing from interviews with Goldman Sachs economists, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, and infrastructure experts, the report highlights concerns about whether scaling training data further will resolve core issues, as data quality matters more than quantity and high-quality sources may be scarce. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, expressed strong skepticism, noting that generative AI remains unreliable for even basic tasks like summarization, often producing nonsensical results, and cited internal tests where AI was six times more expensive than manu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minneapolis General Strike Inspires Solidarity Actions in Over 120 Cities Nationwide]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Minneapolis General Strike, initially organized by the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation and the Minnesota AFL-CIO, is rapidly gaining national attention.

In the third quarter of 2025, the top 1% of households owned 31.7% of all U.S. wealth, the largest share recorded since tracking began in 1989. This group held approximately $55 trillion in assets, roughly matching the combined wealth of the bottom 90% of Americans. The trend highlights a persistent K-shaped economic recovery, where low- and middle-income households experience stalled or slowed wealth growth, while the richest pull further ahead. Experts attribute the widening gap to several factors, including surging stock market gains driven by investments in artificial intelligence, which disproportionately benefit wealthier households with higher stock ownership. In contrast, middle-income families have more wealth tied to real estate, where price growth has moderated.

He claimed the US had been wrong to 'give back' Greenland after World War II (a historical inaccuracy, as Greenland was never US territory) and mocked several leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump ruled out using military force to take Greenland but insisted on negotiations for outright ownership. He also referenced a quip that without the US, Europeans would be 'speaking German,' which drew criticism for being insulting and inaccurate, especially in multilingual Switzerland.

Bruley stated that this behavior is part of a broader pattern of civil rights complaints received from the community, noting that if trained officers who understand constitutional rights are being targeted, it raises serious concerns for the general public.

It emphasizes the importance of balancing creativity with practicality, noting that socks function as both fashion statements and wearable objects subject to stretch, motion, and structural limitations. A good sock design, according to the piece, focuses on visual clarity, durability, and adaptability to the fabric's behavior. Clear, bold patterns outperform intricate artwork, since socks are viewed mostly from a distance, and small details can disappear or distort when worn.

The text highlights several effective design approaches such as using minimal line icons, micro-patterns, and directional stripes to create visually balanced and functional results. It points out that large motifs with ample negative space or abstract color blocks can conceal distortion well, while simple botanical silhouettes and restrained typography add personality without losing legibility.

According to Bessent, sanctions intentionally targeted Iran’s access to global financial networks and oil revenue, cutting it off from foreign reserves. By December 2025, the Iranian rial had lost over 80% of its value, triggering inflation exceeding 40% and dramatic spikes in food prices, which fueled public unrest.

Despite this economic hardship, the article argues that the sanctions have also strengthened Iran’s determination and pushed it toward greater cooperation with adversaries of the United States. Iran has adopted methods to circumvent restrictions, such as operating a 'ghost fleet' of tankers to continue crude exports—mostly to China, which now purchases about 90% of Iranian oil at discounted prices.

The document, attributed to Acting Director Todd Lyons, was shared with Senator Richard Blumenthal by whistleblowers represented by Whistleblower Aid. It marks a significant shift from prior DHS policy, which traditionally required judicial warrants signed by judges for home entry. The memo cites guidance from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of General Counsel stating that neither the Constitution nor immigration laws prohibit this practice.

In Iceland, the government has committed to a plebiscite by 2027 on resuming EU accession talks, and recent polls show a relative majority supporting membership for the first time since 2015, driven by fears of NATO unreliability under U.S. assertiveness.

Trump's Davos speech focused on pushing for U.S. control of Greenland for security reasons, confusing it with Iceland at times, and threatening tariffs on European allies opposing the move.

The first transaction generated $500 million, with $300 million routed through Qatari banks to Venezuela's interim government under Delcy Rodríguez. These funds aim to stabilize the devaluing bolívar by injecting them into the currency market. The deal stems from Trump's announced plan for Venezuela to supply 30-50 million barrels to the US at market prices (around $56 per barrel), potentially worth up to $2.8 billion, shifting from discounted sales. The US oversees the process as leverage over Venezuela's politics and economy, with plans for American companies to invest in rehabilitating the nation's oil infrastructure amid its vast reserves exceeding 300 billion barrels.

This article outlines ten frequent mistakes made by designers and provides clear fixes. Key issues include using lines that are too thin for metal durability, cramming excessive detail into tiny 1-1.5 inch sizes leading to visual clutter, incorporating tiny or unsuitable text that becomes illegible, overloading with too many colors or poor separation increasing complexity and cost, relying on gradients and soft shadows that do not translate to flat enamel fills, overlooking how metal plating color affects overall contrast and mood, failing to include a defined border or safety margins causing uneven edges, creating low-]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study Shows Persistent Villous Atrophy in Many Adult Celiac Patients on Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet, But Lamina Propria Immune Normalization Occurs]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent study led by Aida Fiz López, published in Clinical and Experimental Immunology, investigated why many adult celiac disease patients continue to show intestinal mucosal damage despite years of strict gluten-free diet adherence. The research analyzed duodenal biopsies from 19 celiac patients (average 7 years on diet), compared to newly diagnosed patients and healthy controls, using advanced spectral cytometry to examine 72 immune cell populations. Results revealed that 68.4% of patients on the diet still had persistent villous atrophy. Notably, only one patient showed gluten traces in feces, confirming good dietary compliance in the others, and most had negative serology (antibodies). Despite the ongoing atrophy, the immune infiltrate in the lamina propria (including NK cells, B cells, regulatory T cells, and others altered at diagnosis) fully normalized in all diet-treated patients.

Firming products primarily work on the skin's surface and upper layers by enhancing hydration, improving texture for better light reflection, and supporting elasticity, resulting in plumper, smoother, and more resilient-looking skin. The article emphasizes that true 'all-over lift' comes from better hydration to reduce crepiness, smoother texture, and gradual resilience rather than dramatic physical lifting. A simple morning routine should include a gentle cleanse, a lightweight firming serum or treatment, a hydrating moisturizer, and most importantly, daily broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent UV damage, which accelerates loss of firmness. At night, focus on deeper nourishment: thorough cleansing followed by a targeted firming treatment and a richer moisturizer to repair and soften dry]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/building-an-effective-firming-skincare-routine-for-improved-skin-elasticity-and-lifted-appearance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/building-an-effective-firming-skincare-routine-for-improved-skin-elasticity-and-lifted-appearance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Capital One Shopping Rewards Limited to Southwest Rapid Rewards Points Purchases, Not Flight Bookings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Capital One Shopping, a popular browser extension and service that provides cashback rewards and coupons, has been sending targeted emails highlighting 'Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards' as an offer. This might lead users to believe they can earn rewards when booking actual Southwest flights through the portal. However, this is not the case. The rewards are only applicable when purchasing Rapid Rewards points directly, typically via Points.com, and explicitly exclude purchases of flights, hotels, cars, vacations, cruises, or gift cards. The article's author initially noticed this in emails received a couple of weeks prior to January 21, 2026, and investigated further. Unlike some other shopping portals that clearly label Southwest offers as 'Rapid Rewards – Points' or link directly to the points purchase page, Capital One Shopping lists it ambiguously as 'Southwest Rapid Rewards' and links to the main Rapid Rewards section of Southwest's site, creating potential confusion.

The card, once celebrated for its simplicity and generous travel perks, now offers a wide array of complicated credits and coupons. Greg explains that determining the card’s value depends on how effectively a cardholder uses those benefits, particularly new additions such as The Edit travel credits, StubHub rebates, Lyft and DoorDash credits, and entertainment subscriptions like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. 

To assess whether the card is worth keeping, Greg introduces a personal evaluation method using his 'bundling' approach. Instead of pricing each coupon individually, he groups related benefits—like travel perks or miscellaneous lifestyle credits—and estimates how much he would realistically pay for those bundles.

A recent systematic review published in Advances in Bamboo Science analyzed decades of research, including human trials, animal studies, and lab work, on bamboo shoots and derived compounds. Key findings indicate that bamboo shoots are rich in dietary fiber, such as cellulose and lignin, which supports digestion, gut health, regularity, and possibly beneficial gut bacteria. Early human studies suggest benefits for metabolic health, including better blood sugar regulation and improved cholesterol levels, which could lower risks for diabetes and heart disease. Lab research reveals antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce cellular stress and chronic inflammation.

The unrest, which involved thousands of participants, turned violent with reports of smashed windows, property damage, and clashes with police. Authorities deployed riot gear, water cannons, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets after protesters allegedly threw stones and fireworks; no injuries were reported. The protests were fueled by Trump's persistent threats to acquire Greenland from Denmark for US security reasons, including refusing to rule out military action and proposing tariffs on European countries supporting Denmark. In response, European leaders like Ursula von der Leyen criticized the tariff threats and asserted Europe's role in Arctic security.

Unlike standard doors, fire doors are constructed with solid cores, fire-resistant materials, and intumescent seals that expand under heat to seal gaps, typically resisting fire for 30 to 60 minutes. This containment limits damage, reduces smoke inhalation risks, and helps maintain clearer escape routes, especially in critical areas like stairwells, hallways, and landings in multi-storey homes. The article highlights how fire doors protect escape paths by keeping temperatures lower and visibility better for longer periods. Modern advancements include fire-rated glass panels that allow natural light to pass between rooms without compromising safety, as these panels are tested to withstand high temperatures and prevent flame passage.

Describing the island as a 'piece of ice, cold and poorly located' essential for global security, Trump criticized NATO allies for lacking support on the issue and wrongly attributed a recent US stock market dip to 'Iceland,' claiming it had cost the country money. He made similar errors the day before in a White House briefing. Despite the gaffes, Trump called for immediate negotiations to gain 'right, title and ownership' of Greenland, insisting the US would not use force but warning that refusal would be remembered.

This tool offers various defensive measures, such as imposing punitive tariffs, refusing patent recognition, and excluding certain US products or companies from the European market. However, the article argues that the ACI is merely a toolbox of retaliatory options rather than a decisive weapon. The real potential 'bazooka' lies in Europe's massive holdings of US Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets.

He claimed the U.S. dollar has weakened by 28% over the past five years, describing inflation as a 'scam' that allows politicians to obscure real economic impacts. Using a personal example, Scaramucci noted that his parents purchased a house in 1962 for $16,000, equivalent to 457 ounces of gold at $35 per ounce. Today, a similar house is valued at $750,000, but at current gold prices of around $3,300 per ounce, it equates to only 227 ounces—demonstrating a loss in real value despite nominal gains. He emphasized that people often mistake larger dollar figures for increased wealth, when in reality the currency's value has declined.

Drawing on reports from Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11, journalist Jonathan Ofir describes how fruit growers, particularly those producing citrus and mangoes, warn of a potential collapse. European buyers are avoiding Israeli fruits, while the Houthi blockade in the Red Sea has caused major shipping disruptions to Asian markets. Together, these pressures have left Russia as one of the few remaining destinations for Israeli produce — creating what one farmer calls an 'alliance of the boycotted.' 

The report highlights the rapid decline of once-iconic exports like Jaffa oranges, emblematic of Israel’s agricultural brand, which also carries a history of cultural appropriation from Palestinian farming traditions.

However, escalating tensions between the US and European allies over President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland—accompanied by tariff threats against Denmark and other NATO members—shifted the focus away from Ukraine-related agreements. According to reports from Axios and the Financial Times, the dispute overshadowed preparations, leading to the postponement of any formal signing or major announcement involving Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and European leaders. US officials emphasized that no specific date had been fixed and that the plan required further refinements. While Trump is set to attend Davos with a large delegation and plans meetings with Zelensky and European counterparts, expectations]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-greenland-dispute-delays-planned-ukraine-reconstruction-prosperity-deal-at-davos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-s-greenland-dispute-delays-planned-ukraine-reconstruction-prosperity-deal-at-davos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 21:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democrats Urge Invocation of 25th Amendment Over Trump's Greenland Acquisition Push]]></title><description><![CDATA[Several Democratic politicians, including Representatives Sydney Kamlager-Dove, Yassamin Ansari, Eric Swalwell, and Senator Ed Markey, have publicly called for invoking Section 4 of the 25th Amendment to remove President Donald Trump from office. This stems from his escalating efforts to acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he claims is essential for U.S. national security in the Arctic. Trump has refused to rule out military force and recently sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, stating he 'no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace' after not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, which was awarded to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado. Critics link this to perceived instability, with some describing Trump as 'unfit to lead,' 'out of control,' or 'extremely mentally ill.'

Standard overwater bungalows can often be booked using Marriott Bonvoy points (around 71,000–77,500 per night) or 85K free night certificates, providing excellent value far exceeding typical valuations for Marriott redemptions.

Violent clashes between protesters and police in Zurich resulted in property damage and the use of water cannons, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd. The situation has escalated Trump's public spats with European leaders, with Ursula von der Leyen criticizing his tariffs threats and highlighting Europe’s Arctic policing capabilities.

He referenced Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's symbolic regifting of her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump as an example. Newsom urged European lawmakers to 'stop being complicit,' 'have a backbone,' and stand united rather than allowing Trump to 'play folks for fools.' He likened Trump to a 'T-Rex,' stating one must either 'mate with him or he devours you.'

Business leaders expressed frustration with perpetual pilot projects that fail to scale due to poor data quality, undefined processes, and weak governance. Experts like PwC's Mohamed Kande emphasized the need for top-down strategies focusing on high-impact use cases that directly affect revenue, costs, or customer experience, integrating AI into core business operations with clear productivity metrics. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned that if AI benefits remain concentrated in big tech, it risks becoming a bubble rather than a productive revolution, stressing democratization for gains in health, education, public sectors, and SMEs.

It highlights Greenland's strategic value, rooted in WWII-era bases for Atlantic protection and Arctic weather intelligence, and post-war US military presence via agreements. Denmark is portrayed as a colonial power that has gradually granted autonomy, including a 31-seat parliament (Inatsisartut) and EU exit in 1985. The political scene features five parties: the pro-Denmark Democratic Party (10 seats), nationalist Naleraq (8 seats, fast independence), ecosocialist Inuit Ataqatigiit (7 seats, gradual independence), center-left Siumut, and conservative unionist Atassut (2 seats).

This shift occurred as the EU drastically reduced Russian gas imports following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, dropping from 50 percent to 12 percent, with a full ban on Russian gas phased in. Projections indicate that by 2030, nearly half of the EU's gas could come from the US, representing up to 80 percent of its LNG imports, according to data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). This growing dependency creates a significant geopolitical risk, especially as transatlantic relations deteriorate under US President Donald Trump.

Melasma, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is often aggravated by UV exposure or tanning beds and can appear as brown or gray spots that sometimes itch or irritate the skin.

The article emphasizes that while chemical treatments and surgeries can offer results, they may cause irritation or long-term damage to the skin barrier. Instead, it promotes chemical-free approaches to maintain youthful, healthy skin through lifestyle changes and natural remedies.

Key lifestyle habits include staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water to keep skin elastic and glowing, eating a balanced diet rich in fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats to combat free radicals and support collagen production, getting sufficient quality sleep for skin cell renewal, and managing stress to prevent premature aging signs.

Natural skincare options from kitchen ingredients are highlighted, such as aloe vera gel for its vitamins C and E that boost collagen and hydrate skin, coconut oil for antioxidant protection and deep moisturization, honey as a humectant to draw]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/natural-methods-to-slow-down-wrinkles-and-support-skin-health</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/natural-methods-to-slow-down-wrinkles-and-support-skin-health</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Far-right influencers sing controversial song at Miami nightclub, prompting firings and bans]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Miami nightclub, Vendome, faced criticism after a group of far-right influencers, including Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate, were filmed singing along to Ye's song containing Nazi references. The event, which occurred on January 17, 2026, also featured some participants making Nazi salutes. The footage circulated widely on social media, sparking outrage from Jewish organizations, elected officials, and the public. The nightclub apologized, condemned antisemitism, and fired three employees while banning the personalities involved. They also implemented stricter content controls and management oversight to prevent similar incidents in the future. The song, which glorifies Hitler and has been banned on multiple streaming platforms, intensified concerns about far-right extremist influence and antisemitic rhetoric.

Over this seven-year period, the party generated ordinary losses of approximately 1.29 million euros, which it offset by selling historical real estate assets worth 1.56 million euros, with the majority of sales (1.44 million euros) occurring between 2021 and 2023. Without these asset liquidations, the PCE would have recorded unsustainable deficits in its operations. Total ordinary income reached 13.16 million euros, with about 70% classified as private sources and 30% as direct public funding—contrasting sharply with major parties like the PP (83% public) and PSOE (68% public).

The government is reforming the Hydrocarbons Law to introduce Productive Participation Contracts, enabling foreign capital and technology—particularly from US firms like Chevron and ExxonMobil—to revitalize the oil sector and boost production. A key initial step was signing a contract for exporting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), aligning with expressed US interests under Donald Trump in leading Venezuela's energy reactivation. To address social emergencies and high inflation, two new sovereign funds were created: one for direct social protection (supporting workers, health, and education) and another for urgent infrastructure repairs in water, electricity, and roads, both funded by oil revenues.

This deal, finalized in July 2025 after prolonged negotiations, aimed to reduce tariffs on US industrial goods entering the EU market and resolve ongoing trade disputes, including previous US impositions of 15% tariffs on EU exports. The delay serves as a symbolic yet impactful protest against President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose new tariffs on several EU member states—particularly France and Germany—if they do not support US acquisition of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.

El incidente tuvo un impacto directo en el equipo femenino del Txuri Urdin, club donostiarra que disputaba un encuentro en la instalación. Diez jugadoras del equipo presentaron síntomas compatibles con una intoxicación leve por inhalación de este gas tóxico, como mareos, dolor de cabeza y malestar general.

Según ARDE, estas condiciones serían incompatibles con cualquier estándar mínimo de bienestar animal.

El caso resulta especialmente relevante porque la explotación dispone del sello de bienestar animal Welfair y del certificado Free to Fly, lo que ha generado dudas sobre la fiabilidad y el control real de estas certificaciones.

La salida se produce sin que el país haya cumplido con sus obligaciones financieras, dejando impagos al menos 278 millones de dólares en cuotas correspondientes al periodo presupuestario 2024–2025, además de una cantidad indeterminada de fondos voluntarios prometidos.

Aunque el aviso formal de retirada se comunicó hace un año, la desvinculación práctica fue inmediata: la administración Trump cortó relaciones con la OMS desde el primer momento, justificando la decisión por su gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19, el sistema de cuotas y lo que considera un trato indulgente hacia China. A diferencia de su primer intento de salida durante el anterior mandato, que fue revocado por la administración Biden, esta vez el proceso ha culminado sin marcha atrás.

Aunque no se especificó un calendario concreto para este objetivo inicial, el pacto retoma metas anteriores más ambiciosas, como alcanzar 120 GW para 2030 y hasta 300 GW para 2050.

Estas 'alucinaciones liliputienses', término psiquiátrico inspirado en Los viajes de Gulliver, son sorprendentemente consistentes entre los afectados y pueden durar entre 12 y 24 horas, llegando incluso a requerir hospitalización prolongada.

A partir de su experiencia como observadora en juicios y miembro del grupo Palestine on Trial, Gari describe un entramado judicial y policial que, según sus estimaciones, ha dado lugar a unos 11.000 procesos judiciales relacionados con la solidaridad con Palestina.

El objetivo principal de esta estrategia represiva, sostiene, es desmovilizar: los elevados costes económicos de multas, abogados y procesos judiciales, junto con el desgaste psicológico —ansiedad, depresión, insomnio—, empujan a muchas personas a abandonar la militancia. Gari denuncia prácticas sistemáticas de violencia policial seguidas de acusaciones contra las propias víctimas, especialmente por delitos como “resistencia a la autoridad” o “agresión a la policía”, cargos que pueden implicar antecedentes penales, penas de cárcel ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-del-activismo-pro-palestina-en-alemania-como-laboratorio-politico-y-judicial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-del-activismo-pro-palestina-en-alemania-como-laboratorio-politico-y-judicial</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis: El experto Federico Finchelstein advierte que el trumpismo se acerca rápidamente al fascismo mediante la militarización de la política]]></title><description><![CDATA[El historiador Federico Finchelstein, especialista en fascismos, dictaduras y populismo, analiza en este artículo cómo Estados Unidos bajo la administración de Donald Trump está experimentando una acelerada deriva autoritaria con rasgos fascistas.

Destaca la militarización de la política interna y externa, donde Trump actúa como un comandante que gestiona decisiones como si fueran campañas militares, incluyendo referencias a Venezuela o Groenlandia.

Anteriormente, la aprobación había alcanzado el 50 % en febrero y marzo. Este descenso se produce dos días después de que agentes federales de inmigración mataran a tiros a Alex Pretti, un enfermero de UCI de 37 años en Minneapolis, durante un enfrentamiento en una protesta. Vídeos del suceso han desmentido las afirmaciones de cargos de la Administración Trump, como la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional Kristi Noem y el subjefe de gabinete Stephen Miller, quienes calificaron a Pretti de 'terrorista doméstico' y de haber intentado asesinar a agentes.

Trump ha publicado un largo y airado mensaje en su red social Truth, donde califica la demanda de “ridícula” y asegura que detener ahora las obras sería “devastador” para la Casa Blanca.

La crisis habitacional en España no solo afecta a los jóvenes, sino también a personas con empleo y vida familiar estable, debido a los altos precios de compra, la presión fiscal y la dificultad de ahorro. El testimonio de Romero pone de manifiesto el impacto emocional y social de esta problemática, desmotivando a la población para trabajar y emprender. El experto en hipotecas José Paino, señala que para acceder a una hipoteca se requiere un salario mínimo de 2.500€ mensuales, lo que agrava aún más la situación.

Este dato, publicado por la Encuesta de Población Activa (EPA), viene acompañado además de un récord histórico de empleo, con 22,46 millones de personas ocupadas tras la creación de más de 605.000 puestos de trabajo a lo largo del año.

Aunque la reducción del número de personas desempleadas fue relativamente moderada —algo menos de 120.000—, este comportamiento se explica por el fuerte aumento de la población activa, que rozó los 25 millones de personas. El mercado laboral español no solo es hoy más grande que nunca, sino que también muestra una evolución más estable que en ciclos anteriores, alejándose de las cifras extremas de desempleo que se alcanzaron en 2013, cuando el paro llegó a rozar el 27%.

Desde sus años de estudiante en la Escuela Politécnica de Zúrich, Einstein comenzó a navegar en los lagos alpinos, desarrollando una gran habilidad para interpretar los cambios meteorológicos, a pesar de que nunca aprendió a nadar. Una anécdota vivida junto a Marie Curie en el lago Lemán ilustra tanto su sangre fría como el carácter imprevisible de esas aguas.

El autor sostiene que los informes jurídicos y de intervención han pasado de acompañar la decisión a sustituirla, en un contexto institucional marcado por el control ex post, la personalización de la responsabilidad y el miedo al reproche posterior. Esto genera decisiones defensivas, retrasos y pérdida de oportunidades.

El texto subraya que los informes se solicitan habitualmente tarde, cuando las alternativas ya están cerradas, y se formulan como si el Derecho ofreciera una única solución posible. Esta ficción de univocidad oculta la pluralidad real de opciones que suelen existir en el Derecho administrativo, caracterizado por normas abiertas, conceptos jurídicos indeterminados y márgenes de discrecionalidad.

Johnson, de 44 años, fue arrestado en julio de 2025 y está acusado de abusar de una víctima durante varios meses a partir de 2024. Según documentos judiciales, Johnson habría intentado silenciar a la víctima ofreciéndole un pago y afirmando que había recibido un indulto por su participación en el asalto al Capitolio, mencionando incluso que sería incluido en su testamento. Tras los hechos del 6 de enero, Johnson se declaró culpable de cuatro cargos federales relacionados con el asalto y fue condenado a un año de prisión en 2024, pena que quedó anulada con el indulto de Trump. Actualmente, Johnson permanece detenido y se ha declarado no culpable en el caso de Florida.

El autor denuncia cómo se atribuyen victorias y derrotas directamente a los técnicos (como si Flick venciera a Alonso o Ancelotti), ignorando factores como la calidad de los jugadores, lesiones, expulsiones o días inspirados de ciertos futbolistas. Ejemplos como el vídeo viral de Tedesco usando botellas para 'corregir' a Asensio, o las actitudes exhibicionistas de entrenadores como Arteta con altavoces o Amorim defendiendo su idea hasta el ridículo pese a malos resultados, ilustran este 'frikismo': una banalización que simplifica un deporte complejo y lo convierte en performance mediática.

Según el diplomático, durante la denominada Operación Resolución Absoluta, muchos miembros de los cuerpos de seguridad 'no hicieron todo lo que podían' para detener el avance de las fuerzas extranjeras. Además, afirmó que Rusia conoce los nombres de los 'traidores' que huyeron del país y que habían trabajado sistemáticamente para la inteligencia estadounidense mucho antes de la operación.

Melik-Bagdasarov también criticó la falta de capacitación de los militares venezolanos, lo que impidió el uso efectivo de los sistemas de defensa antiaérea de origen ruso durante el operativo.

Estas incluyen agresiones físicas y verbales que ocurren en el aula, durante el recreo y en el servicio de comedor. Los padres alegan que la situación ha provocado lesiones documentadas con partes médicos (una registrada ya en marzo de 2024), impacto emocional en los menores que presencian los hechos, y bajas médicas repetidas entre el profesorado, incluyendo tutores, personal de apoyo y la orientadora.

Como medida de protesta, la gran mayoría de las familias decidieron no llevar a sus hijos a clase el jueves y viernes, dejando prácticamente vacías las aulas de ese curso. Paralelamente, han lanzado una campaña por WhatsApp bajo el lema 'Aulas Vacías. Stop Violencia' para visibilizar el rechazo a esta situación y exigir soluciones inmediatas.

El apartamento, de 45 metros cuadrados y distribuido en dos plantas, cuenta con comedor, cocina, espacio de teletrabajo en la planta baja, y un mini salón con cama y armario en la planta superior. Este precio es considerablemente más económico que un dúplex de características similares en España, donde el alquiler podría oscilar entre 1.500 y 1.900 euros mensuales, dependiendo de la ubicación. La noticia contextualiza la situación del mercado inmobiliario español, destacando que el precio medio del alquiler alcanzó los 14,7 euros por metro cuadrado el año pasado, situando a ciudades como Barcelona y Madrid entre las más caras, con cifras que superan ampliamente los salarios medios.

Esta situación es descrita como un auténtico paraíso fiscal, incompatible con el principio de igualdad ante la ley.

Los simpatizantes gritaron consignas como 'Todos somos Unidad 100', en referencia a la unidad militar a la que pertenecen los acusados. El vídeo filtrado del incidente muestra a varios soldados golpeando y, presuntamente, violando en grupo al detenido tras escudarse con escudos antidisturbios, lo que provocó graves lesiones internas y rectales en la víctima, quien requirió múltiples cirugías.

Bajo el título «Geopolítica… o no», el texto firmado por ContinuumST propone un juego literario basado en definiciones encadenadas que remiten a palabras concretas, identificadas únicamente por pistas semánticas, geográficas o etimológicas y por el número de letras que las componen.

El microrrelato se construye como una sucesión de enigmas lingüísticos: desde referencias a Ecuador o Argentina hasta descripciones físicas, cromáticas o conceptuales, pasando por términos en desuso o acciones específicas como conducir ganado o lograr el amor de alguien. Cada definición invita al lector a participar activamente, descifrando la palabra escondida y estableciendo conexiones entre lengua, cultura y territorio.

El artículo no se centra en relatar la biografía de Pestaña ni los detalles políticos de su viaje, sino en una imagen que lo retrata durante este evento histórico. La obra fue realizada por el pintor ucraniano de origen judío Isaac Brodsky, destacado representante del realismo socialista, quien fue nombrado director de la Academia Panrusa de las Artes en 1934 y recibió la Orden de Lenin ese mismo año. Brodsky, conocido por sus retratos de Lenin y obras históricas, fue encargado de representar la inauguración del congreso en el Palacio Uritski de Petrogrado. La pintura, de gran formato, fue creada con la colaboración de otros artistas y se utilizó un meticuloso registro de 125 retratos individuales para representar a todos los participantes, entre ellos Ángel Pestaña.

Entre los mensajes se incluyen deseos de muerte, amenazas de agresión física y comentarios extremadamente degradantes.

El episodio se caracteriza por lluvias intensas, fuertes rachas de viento, mala mar y un ambiente inusualmente templado para esta época del año. En el mapa de avisos destaca que prácticamente todas las comunidades presentan algún nivel de alerta, con la excepción parcial de Aragón durante la jornada del martes.

La situación más preocupante se da en Galicia, donde la Aemet ha activado el aviso rojo por precipitaciones muy intensas que podrían dejar acumulados significativos. A estas lluvias se suma el riesgo añadido del deshielo debido a las temperaturas suaves, lo que incrementa la probabilidad de crecidas en ríos y zonas inundables.

El estudio analiza el periodo comprendido entre 2003 y 2022 y se centra específicamente en la evasión fiscal de los contribuyentes, es decir, en la ocultación parcial de ingresos legales, sin incluir la economía sumergida asociada a actividades ilegales como el tráfico de drogas.

Para calcular la denominada brecha fiscal, Fedea compara las rentas declaradas en el IRPF con las cifras de la contabilidad regional. Los resultados muestran que el grado de cumplimiento fiscal ha oscilado entre el 72,2% registrado en 2005 y el 86% alcanzado en 2020. En el último año analizado, 2022, el cumplimiento se situó en el 85,3%, lo que implica que el 14,7% de las rentas no fueron declaradas, equivalente a unos ingresos ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-evasion-fiscal-en-el-irpf-reduce-la-recaudacion-anual-entre-21-000-y-51-000-millones-de-euros</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-evasion-fiscal-en-el-irpf-reduce-la-recaudacion-anual-entre-21-000-y-51-000-millones-de-euros</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El mapa de mayor resolución de la materia oscura revela la estructura del universo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un equipo internacional de científicos ha elaborado el mapa más detallado hasta la fecha de la materia oscura del universo utilizando imágenes del telescopio espacial James Webb.

La materia oscura, que constituye aproximadamente el 85 % de la materia del universo, no emite ni absorbe luz, por lo que su detección se realiza observando cómo su gravedad desvía la luz de galaxias lejanas. La sección cartografiada cubre un área unas 2,5 veces mayor que la luna llena en la constelación de Sextans e incluye unas 250 000 galaxias.

Aunque la Estrategia de Seguridad Nacional rechaza el dominio global previo de EE.UU. y aboga por una postura más agresiva en el hemisferio occidental —evidenciada en acciones militares en Venezuela y la intención de controlar Groenlandia—, existen claras contradicciones. Parsi destaca que el documento minimiza la relevancia de Oriente Medio, pero en la práctica aumenta el riesgo de una guerra mayor con Irán. Se menciona que a finales de diciembre, durante una visita de Netanyahu, se habría decidido un ataque a Irán, posiblemente no limitado, sino orientado a derrocar el régimen actual, decapitar su liderazgo y buscar un relevo interno, seguido de intensos bombardeos israelíes para destruir su capacidad militar, similar a lo ocurrido en Siria.

Los resultados indican que las mujeres tienden a encontrar más atractivas a los hombres con una estatura mayor, una relación hombros-cadera más amplia y un pene relativamente más grande, aunque estos atributos ejercen un efecto decreciente al llegar a extremos.

Se trata del tercer hueso del carpo de la pata delantera derecha de un elefante, lo que constituye una evidencia física muy rara en Europa sobre el uso de estos animales en conflictos bélicos de la Antigüedad. Junto al hueso se encontraron doce esferas de piedra, propias de catapultas de torsión (lithoboloi o petroboloi), una punta de flecha pesada y una moneda cartaginesa del tipo 'Casco', elementos que apuntan a un episodio militar en la ciudad ibera de Corduba. La investigación sugiere que el hallazgo podría estar relacionado con escaramuzas o asedios durante la invasión cartaginesa liderada por Amílcar Barca y sus sucesores.

La industria conservera en Tapia tiene raíces que se remontan al siglo XIX, con firmas como Conservas Pérez Casariego, Terín o Hijos de Carlo Albo, que durante años lideraron la producción y exportación de pescado, incluyendo envíos a Iberoamérica. Albo inició su actividad en la villa en 1935, alquilando naves hasta construir un edificio moderno en 1941, donde comenzó a contratar operarias con salarios diarios entre 4 y 4,80 pesetas. En 1960, la fábrica se transformó para producir platos preparados, y en los años ochenta se modernizó manteniendo un estándar de alta calid]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albo-cierra-su-fabrica-en-tapia-tras-91-anos-marcando-el-fin-de-una-era-en-la-industria-conservera-local</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/albo-cierra-su-fabrica-en-tapia-tras-91-anos-marcando-el-fin-de-una-era-en-la-industria-conservera-local</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pozo petrolero abandonado mata fauna y desplaza familias desde 2023 en Argentina]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra las consecuencias devastadoras de un pozo petrolero abandonado en Argentina, que está causando la muerte de animales, la contaminación del medio ambiente y el desplazamiento de familias que viven cerca.

La intención de la empresa matriz es vender todas las propiedades a un único comprador, manteniendo la gestión de los inmuebles, lo que podría derivar en subidas de precios y afectar directamente a las familias que residen en ellas. A pesar de que la Comunidad de Madrid tiene la capacidad legal para intervenir mediante el derecho de tanteo y retracto —un mecanismo que permitiría adquirir las viviendas antes que un tercero y garantizar su permanencia en el parque público—, la administración no lo ha ejercido. El portavoz de vivienda de Más Madrid, Jorge Moruno, denuncia que la excusa oficial para no actuar es que ha expirado el plazo de ocho años de vigencia de la normativa aplicable.

Las acusaciones incluyen palizas severas, abuso sexual, amenazas coercitivas para forzar deportaciones a terceros países sin vínculos (como México, El Salvador o África), negación de acceso adecuado a abogados, hambre y negligencia médica. Dos testimonios destacados describen tortura sexual explícita: un adolescente (bajo pseudónimo 'Samuel') afirma que agentes le aplastaron los testículos, le golpearon hasta perder el conocimiento, le rompieron un diente y le introdujeron dedos en los oídos mientras se burlaban de él, causándole daños permanentes en el oído.

Rutte rechazó de forma tajante la idea de una autonomía militar europea plena al margen de la alianza atlántica, insistiendo en que pensar lo contrario es poco realista en el contexto geopolítico actual.

Las declaraciones se producen en un momento de distensión parcial entre Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea, después de que el presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, anunciara la retirada de aranceles a sus aliados europeos y avanzara un principio de acuerdo con la OTAN en relación con el futuro de Groenlandia. Según explicó Rutte, él y Trump han acordado establecer dos “vías de trabajo” para abordar las tensiones y los retos estratégicos en el Ártico.

En concreto, entre el 80% y el 85% de las personas de ascendencia asiática portan una alteración en el gen ABCC11, mientras que esta mutación solo aparece en alrededor del 3% de las personas de origen europeo o africano. Este gen desempeña un papel clave en la producción del olor axilar, ya que codifica una proteína implicada en la liberación de lípidos a través de las glándulas sudoríparas apocrinas, localizadas principalmente en las axilas y la entrepierna.

El olor corporal humano no procede directamente del sudor, sino de la acción de las bacterias de la piel, que descomponen estas sustancias grasas y generan compuestos volátiles responsables del olor característico. En las personas con la mutación del ABCC11, los lípidos no se liberan de la misma forma al sudor, lo que reduce notablemente la actividad bacteriana as]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-mutacion-genetica-reduce-el-olor-corporal-en-gran-parte-de-la-poblacion-de-asia-oriental</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-mutacion-genetica-reduce-el-olor-corporal-en-gran-parte-de-la-poblacion-de-asia-oriental</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel ha eliminado más de 2.700 linajes familiares palestinos en el genocidio de Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo alega que Israel ha borrado más de 2.700 linajes familiares palestinos en la franja de Gaza.

La iniciativa está pensada para corregir los efectos del nuevo reglamento de extranjería y dar respuesta a una realidad social consolidada: la presencia de miles de personas que viven y trabajan en España sin papeles.

La comparecencia, realizada por videoconferencia desde Andorra, supone un punto de inflexión en la causa judicial, ya que Mur ha implicado directamente a la cúpula de la Consejería de Sanidad del Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso en la elaboración y validación de dichos documentos.

Los resultados muestran que el 68,4 % mantenía atrofia (Marsh ≥3) y el 73,3 % un linfograma compatible con celiaquía activa, pese a que solo un paciente tenía trazas de gluten detectables en heces, lo que confirma buena adherencia en casi todos.

A partir del personaje de Perfectus Detritus, antagonista del álbum ‘La cizaña’, el autor reflexiona sobre la figura del agitador profesional: alguien capaz de envenenar cualquier conversación, generar discordia y dinamitar proyectos colectivos mediante la mentira, la manipulación y la confrontación constante. Francino recuerda cómo los cómics de Astérix han sabido retratar, con humor costumbrista, los estereotipos y vicios humanos en distintos pueblos y épocas, creando personajes secundarios memorables que encarnan defectos universales.

En ese marco simbólico, el autor establece un paralelismo entre Perfectus Detritus y determinadas figuras de la política española actual.

Entre 1955 y 2001 coexistieron distintos modelos: el desarrollismo franquista, el periodo regulado postfranquista y el preburbuja. Durante el franquismo, las viviendas protegidas eran accesibles gracias a subvenciones estatales, precios fijados políticamente y trabajo obligatorio del futuro propietario, mientras que la vivienda libre estaba fuera del alcance de la mayoría. En la transición democrática, la vivienda protegida continuó siendo un pilar, pero los créditos seguían siendo caros, limitando la capacidad de compra. Ya en los años noventa, la caída de los tipos de interés y la consolidación del hogar de doble salario transformaron el mercado: la vivienda pasó a depender del crédito y no del salario familiar, lo que disparó la capacidad de endeudamiento y abrió el camino a la burbuja inmobilia]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evolucion-del-acceso-a-la-vivienda-en-espana-como-han-cambiado-los-precios-y-las-condiciones-de-compra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evolucion-del-acceso-a-la-vivienda-en-espana-como-han-cambiado-los-precios-y-las-condiciones-de-compra</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Factores que favorecen el auge de la extrema derecha en España y Cataluña]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo analiza cómo ciertos fenómenos sociales y políticos pueden empujar a ciudadanos hacia posturas de extrema derecha. Parte de la premisa de que recientes resultados electorales en Extremadura y encuestas en Aragón reflejan un aumento del apoyo a partidos ultraderechistas, incluso entre antiguos votantes socialistas. El autor se basa en el libro 'El Fascismo eterno' de Umberto Eco para explicar que, aunque los fachas cambian con el tiempo, siguen un patrón similar. Primero, se fomenta la confusión mediante la saturación de información y mensajes contradictorios, lo que provoca miedo y desorientación. En respuesta al miedo, la extrema derecha apela a la tradición, el culto al pasado y la creación de un líder fuerte y carismático que encarne los valores de un pueblo 'elegido'. Además, se promueve la supremacía por nacimiento frente a las élites meritorias y se construye la imagen de enemigos fuertes y peligrosos, pero moralmente inferiores, que solo el pueblo unido puede derrota]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/factores-que-favorecen-el-auge-de-la-extrema-derecha-en-espana-y-cataluna</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/factores-que-favorecen-el-auge-de-la-extrema-derecha-en-espana-y-cataluna</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adif admite un fallo administrativo en el pliego de Adamuz pero defiende que las soldaduras se ejecutaron conforme a la normativa técnica]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adif ha reconocido que el pliego de condiciones del contrato de renovación de vías en el tramo Madrid-Andalucía a su paso por Adamuz contenía un error en relación con el tipo de soldadura aluminotérmica exigida para unir carriles de distinta dureza. El documento contractual indicaba que debía utilizarse la soldadura correspondiente al acero más duro, mientras que la normativa interna de Adif establece que, en estos casos excepcionales, debe emplearse la del acero de menor grado para garantizar una mayor capacidad de absorción de esfuerzos.

Según ha confirmado el gestor ferroviario, los trabajos finalmente se ejecutaron conforme a la norma técnica interna y no siguiendo el criterio erróneo del pliego.

Inicialmente, el Ministerio Fiscal había solicitado ocho años de prisión por un delito de retención ilegal agravada, pero retiró la petición al no comparecer la víctima como testigo. La hermana de la joven declaró que ésta no estaba retenida y que podía salir de la casa. Los acusados, de origen paquistaní, defendieron que su intención era ayudar a la joven mediante la lectura de suras del Corán y negaron cualquier uso de violencia. Sin embargo, los agentes que acudieron al lugar encontraron a la joven con heridas y testimonios que indicaban que había sido sujetada a la fuerza durante el ritual.

El desplome del rendimiento de la deuda a 30 años, de un cuarto de punto en un solo día, ha mostrado la vulnerabilidad de un mercado históricamente estable. Japón, con una deuda en circulación superior a siete billones de dólares, ha sido durante años un referente para estrategias de inversión conocidas como carry trade, donde fondos internacionales tomaban prestados yenes para invertir en activos extranjeros. La venta masiva de deuda y la fuerte apreciación del yen han puesto fin a esta estabilidad y llevado al Gobierno japonés a anunciar posibles intervenciones coordinadas con Estados Unidos para frenar movimientos especulativos.

Según el artículo, los turistas canadienses, que antes aportaban entre 38.000 y 42.000 millones de dólares anuales a la economía floridana (especialmente durante la temporada invernal de los 'snowbirds'), redujeron su flujo a más de la mitad en menos de dos años. Esto ha provocado la pérdida estimada de 280.000 empleos en sectores como hostelería, restauración, sanidad auxiliar, mantenimiento e inmobiliaria, con cifras que podrían superar los 310.000 si se incluyen efectos indirectos.

De manera inesperada, la paciente mostró mejoras cognitivas notables: recuperó la capacidad de reconocer a familiares, expresar emociones y realizar cálculos sencillos. Este hallazgo llevó a Sun a iniciar un ensayo clínico con siete pacientes, donde dos experimentaron mejoras rápidas y los demás una recuperación parcial del 50%.

Entre estas hazañas destaca la participación de cuatro amigos franceses que decidieron afrontar la prueba con Vespas P200, scooters no diseñados para un rally extremo. Con modificaciones como ruedas de taco, depósitos de combustible extra y un plan de asistencia con Land Rover siguiendo a cada moto, lograron sortear muchos de los obstáculos. Aunque dos de ellos abandonaron, Jean-Louis Albera y Bernard Simonot consiguieron terminar el Dakar, incluso por delante de algunas motos oficiales, demostrando que la constancia y la estrategia pueden superar la falta de potencia o sofisticación técnica.

Según Puente, incluso si se hubiera auscultado la vía un día antes, no se habría detectado ninguna anomalía relevante. El ministro destacó que no se refería a sabotaje, aunque esta hipótesis no se descarta formalmente, pero no es la más plausible ni prioritaria actualmente.

El accidente se produjo por la ruptura de un tramo del carril nuevo, instalado en mayo de 2025, cerca de la soldadura con el carril antiguo. Los expertos explican que cuando el carril se rompe lo suficiente, los bogies del tren quedan suspendidos y el peso del tren provoca que el raíl se tumbe. Puente aclaró que la causa exacta aún se desconoce y que será necesario examinar tanto el raíl como la soldadura en laboratorio para determinar si la ruptura se debió a un defecto de la soldadura o a la torsión del raíl.

Cartones, plásticos y tiendas de campaña se han convertido en hogares improvisados para cientos de personas.

La falta de datos públicos dificulta conocer cuántas personas viven en estas condiciones, aunque los Equipos de Calle del Ayuntamiento detectaron a finales de 2025 más de mil personas sin hogar, concentradas sobre todo en los distritos de Centro, Arganzuela y Barajas.

Gracias a este enfoque eficiente y basado en datos, junto con el programa global de la OMS, se logró el último caso natural de viruela en Somalia en 1977, y la Organización Mundial de la Salud declaró la erradicación oficial de la enfermedad en 1980.

Según el autor, la versión difundida por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, encabezado por Kristi Noem, carece por completo de veracidad y queda desmentida por testimonios presenciales, grabaciones audiovisuales y el simple sentido común.

Faber sitúa el caso de Pretti junto a otros episodios recientes de violencia estatal, como el asesinato previo de Renee Good, para mostrar un patrón de ejecuciones sumarias encubiertas bajo narrativas oficiales falsas. Destaca el papel central de las imágenes captadas por ciudadanos y activistas, subrayando que, pese a la desconfianza contemporánea hacia la fotografía y el vídeo en la era digital, la multiplicidad de cámaras y fuentes sigue siendo una herramienta poderosa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ejecucion-de-alex-pretti-y-la-defensa-de-la-verdad-frente-a-la-propaganda-oficial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ejecucion-de-alex-pretti-y-la-defensa-de-la-verdad-frente-a-la-propaganda-oficial</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La investigación por corrupción contra Alberto González Amador permanece bloqueada por la ausencia del informe de la UCO solicitado hace más de seis meses]]></title><description><![CDATA[La investigación judicial abierta hace quince meses contra Alberto González Amador, pareja sentimental de la presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, no registra avances relevantes en su pieza separada relativa a presuntos delitos de corrupción en los negocios y administración desleal.

El texto se inscribe en la tradición de la sátira política breve y utiliza el formato del microrrelato para condensar una crítica mordaz al poder, la propaganda y la construcción artificial de la realidad.

La historia parte de un anuncio absurdo pero verosímil: el presidente proclama la conquista de Groenlandia sin que nadie se atreva a llevarle la contraria. Ante la imposibilidad económica de sostener una guerra real —ni siquiera de alquilar Disneylandia como escenografía—, sus asesores optan por una solución precaria y simbólica: montar una falsa victoria con nieve artificial, vallas improvisadas y un decorado cutre al que bautizan como “Presidentland”.

Ambos compartieron orígenes humildes y la pasión inicial por la bicicleta, además de un amigo común, Biagio Cavanna, masajista de Girardengo y quien más tarde descubriría a Fausto Coppi. Girardengo destacó por su resistencia y palmarés impresionante: múltiples victorias en el Giro de Italia (incluyendo liderar de principio a fin en 1919), nueve campeonatos de Italia consecutivos, Milán-San Remo y el Gran Premio Wolber. Sobrevivió a la gripe española y a caídas graves, y se convirtió en un ícono comercial del ciclismo.

Puente ha explicado que no se miente al afirmar que la vía fue revisada y renovada, ya que solo se sustituyen los elementos que se consideran imprescindibles. El PP ha pedido su dimisión por haber asegurado previamente que la renovación era total.

Las autoridades federales y estatales han advertido de que los efectos del frío extremo se prolongarán durante varios días más.

El Servicio Nacional de Meteorología (NWS) ha alertado de acumulaciones significativas de nieve y hielo, con consecuencias potencialmente catastróficas para la movilidad y las infraestructuras.

Argumentan que estos cazas de quinta generación son 'totalmente inútiles' para la defensa tradicional del espacio aéreo belga y expresan preocupación por la supuesta capacidad de Washington de inmovilizar los aparatos globalmente mediante un 'interruptor de apagado' o cortando el suministro de repuestos y actualizaciones, riesgo no confirmado oficialmente pero que genera inquietud en varios países europeos.

Según Bosch, para imputar a alguien por responsabilidad penal en este tipo de sucesos no es suficiente con constatar que se debió realizar una actuación en la vía y no se hizo. Es necesario demostrar que algún cargo de Adif o del Ministerio de Transportes disponía de información concreta sobre el problema existente, tenía la capacidad de resolverlo y, de forma negligente, omitió actuar.

El juez subrayó que el caso pone de manifiesto un problema estructural en la gestión del sistema ferroviario español. Puso como ejemplo los elevados niveles de siniestralidad en la Alta Velocidad comparados con otros países europeos, así como las deficiencias evidentes en el servicio de Rodalies en Cataluña, donde considera que hay mucho margen de mejora.

Esta erosión sonora se debe principalmente a la extinción de especies (como el pájaro Kauaʻi ʻōʻō o la rana de Rabbs), la degradación y homogeneización de hábitats (plantaciones y cultivos intensivos frente a bosques diversos), el ruido industrial y antropogénico que enmascara otros sonidos, y la falta de atención humana hacia estos paisajes sonoros. El autor explica que el sonido conecta a los seres vivos, revela dinámicas ecológicas invisibles y es fruto de millones de años de evolución, desde presiones predatorias hasta selección sexual y cultural en especies como aves y mamíferos.

Cassidy, conocido como el 'hombre del sombrero verde', se convirtió en un símbolo de esta hipocresía. Excombatiente de la Primera Guerra Mundial que encontró dificultades laborales, Cassidy se dedicó al contrabando de alcohol, vendiéndolo principalmente a senadores y congresistas en el Capitolio de Estados Unidos. Su sombrero verde lo hacía fácilmente reconocible y accesible para los políticos, quienes disfrutaban del alcohol mientras promulgaban leyes prohibiéndolo.

La compañía alemana vendió cerca de 247.900 turismos eléctricos, lo que representa un aumento del 49,1% respecto al año anterior, mientras que Tesla descendió de más de 300.000 unidades en 2024 a poco más de 200.000 en 2025. La caída de Tesla se atribuye a varios factores, como la competencia de fabricantes chinos con precios más asequibles, el fortalecimiento de otras marcas europeas gracias a ayudas estatales, y decisiones controvertidas de su CEO. Dentro del Grupo Volkswagen, Audi vendió 223.000 unidades (+8%), Skoda 174.900 (+120%) y Cupra 79.900 (+66%). Modelos como el ID.4 y el ID.7 lideraron las matriculaciones de la marca.

En sus declaraciones en Truth Social y en una entrevista con The Wall Street Journal, Trump defendió la actuación de los agentes y criticó a las víctimas, describiendo a uno de ellos como portador de un arma peligrosa. Paralelamente, ha pedido al Congreso que legisle contra las ciudades santuario y ha exigido que los gobernadores y alcaldes demócratas colaboren en la entrega de inmigrantes ilegales con antecedentes penales para su deportación inmediata.

Por un lado, se describe un evento en la Casa Blanca donde líderes empresariales, políticos y culturales asistieron al estreno de un documental sobre Melania Trump, producido y promocionado con grandes sumas de dinero por Amazon. La cobertura destaca la opulencia y el espectáculo mediático de la administración presidencial, incluyendo una cena de gala y la presentación de la película dirigida por Brett Ratner. Por otro lado, se relata un suceso trágico en Minneapolis, donde Alex Jeffrey Pretti, enfermero de cuidados intensivos, fue asesinado por agentes de la guardia fronteriza mientras grababa su actuación.

Entre febrero de 2015 y marzo de 2016, Villarejo anota conversaciones con el comisario José Luis Olivera y otros mandos en las que se menciona la elaboración de 'notas de pitufeo' (blanqueo en pequeñas cantidades) anónimas enviadas a la Fiscalía Antidroga. Estas notas, que incluían donaciones públicas de Urbán presentadas como sospechosas, desencadenaron diligencias secretas en enero de 2016 y vigilancias en el bar Nueva Visión sin pruebas reales de tráfico de drogas.

Según analistas, la decisión se debió principalmente al fuerte impacto negativo en las bolsas estadounidenses, que perdieron el equivalente a un billón de dólares en un solo día, junto con la oposición interna de algunos republicanos y la creciente unidad en la Unión Europea ante las presiones. Esta no es la primera vez que ocurre algo similar: en abril ya anunció subidas arancelarias globales que luego no se materializaron por el mismo motivo bursátil. Aunque supone un respiro temporal, medios como Le Monde y Financial Times advierten que Trump sigue siendo imprevisible y podría cambiar pronto de obsesión.

Estos mensajes falsos acusan al Ejecutivo 'socialcomunista' de haber 'asesinado' a las víctimas y buscan generar miedo generalizado hacia el transporte en tren.

Brooks analiza un fenómeno cada vez más documentado: el descenso del bienestar emocional y psicológico entre los jóvenes en numerosos países del mundo, especialmente en las sociedades ricas e industrializadas. A partir de los resultados del World Happiness Report y, sobre todo, del Global Flourishing Study (GFS), el autor señala que la tradicional curva en forma de U de la felicidad a lo largo de la vida se ha deformado. Antes, los jóvenes partían de niveles relativamente altos de satisfacción vital que caían en la madurez y volvían a subir a partir de los 50 años; ahora, los jóvenes comienzan ya desde abajo y permanecen en niveles bajos durante décadas.

El GFS, basado en más de 200.000 personas de 22 países y en múltiples dimensiones del bienestar, confirma que este malestar juvenil no es exclusivo de Estados Unidos, aunque allí sea especialmente acusado. Brooks destaca una excepción relevante: los jóvenes con más amistades cercanas y relaciones íntimas manti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-caida-del-bienestar-juvenil-en-los-paises-ricos-y-el-papel-de-las-relaciones-y-el-sentido-vital</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-caida-del-bienestar-juvenil-en-los-paises-ricos-y-el-papel-de-las-relaciones-y-el-sentido-vital</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rodalies reanuda el servicio de forma parcial tras nuevas averías y recomienda limitar desplazamientos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El servicio de Rodalies en Cataluña ha iniciado este lunes una reanudación parcial tras varios días de interrupciones, aunque la vuelta a la circulación ha estado marcada por el caos y la incertidumbre. Apenas media hora después del arranque del servicio, una avería en el centro de control de Adif en la estación de Francia ha provocado una nueva parada total de los trenes, que se ha repetido hasta en dos ocasiones a lo largo de la mañana. Este fallo no es nuevo, ya que se produjo también en julio de 2025, lo que ha vuelto a poner en evidencia la fragilidad del sistema.

Durante las primeras horas, los usuarios se han encontrado con trenes detenidos, información confusa y reaperturas intermitentes de accesos a andenes que terminaban, de nuevo, en la caída del sistema. La desconfianza acumulada tras una semana especialmente complicada ha hecho que muchos viajeros optaran por no utilizar el servicio, lo que ha provocado un aumento del tráfico por carretera.

Su entrada en servicio está prevista para 2030, aunque el primer prototipo se completará en otoño de 2027. El diseño exterior está inspirado en las flores de cerezo (sakura), mientras que el interior prioriza la comodidad de los pasajeros, con asientos en configuración 2+2, mayor espacio para equipaje, más tomas de corriente, plazas adicionales para sillas de ruedas y un enfoque en la privacidad.

El proyecto, denominado Chorus, surge como respuesta directa al cambio en la guerra moderna, donde la producción en masa, la reducción de costes y la rapidez industrial se han vuelto factores estratégicos decisivos, especialmente tras las lecciones del conflicto en Ucrania.

La iniciativa está impulsada por la Dirección générale de l’armement (DGA), que ha identificado una carencia en la capacidad francesa para producir drones consumibles a gran escala. Aunque la base tecnológica procede de la empresa Turgis Gaillard, es Renault quien aporta su experiencia en industrialización, rediseñando el dron para adaptarlo a procesos propios de la automoción, con materiales estandarizados y técnicas de montaje pensadas para grandes volúmenes.

En su obra principal, 'El hombre en busca de sentido', defiende que la vida siempre posee un significado, incluso en las situaciones más extremas de sufrimiento. Observó que quienes encontraban un propósito podían soportar el dolor sin caer en la desesperanza absoluta. Frankl propone una fórmula sencilla: la desesperanza surge del sufrimiento sin propósito (D = S - P). Si se descubre un sentido en la adversidad, esta se transforma en oportunidad de crecimiento personal.

Criticó el existencialismo de Sartre por su visión nihilista y propuso que, aunque no siempre podamos cambiar las circunstancias (biológicas, sociales o psicológicas), conservamos una libertad suprema: elegir la actitud ante lo inevitable.

Al presentar el premio a la mejor serie dramática, la artista aprovechó su turno para ofrecer un monólogo de varios minutos que rápidamente se viralizó en redes sociales.

Además, el texto posibilita la transformación en viviendas de edificaciones ya existentes situadas en primera línea de costa, siempre dentro de determinadas categorías de suelo rústico.

El PROT tendrá carácter prevalente sobre otros instrumentos de planificación territorial, como el Plan de Ordenación del Litoral (POL) y diversas normativas sectoriales, que pasarán a considerarse planes territoriales parciales.

La norma había sido aprobada por unanimidad tanto en la Cámara de Representantes como en el Senado, sin oposición alguna, y fue impulsada por la propia Boebert junto al republicano Jeff Hurd en la Cámara baja, y por senadores demócratas en la alta.

Trump justificó el veto alegando que la medida perpetuaba políticas fallidas del pasado y obligaba a los contribuyentes federales a asumir costes excesivos en un proyecto local de agua.

Esa noche, el programa firmó un 9% de cuota de pantalla y una media de 1.149.000 espectadores, cifras inéditas hasta ahora en su trayectoria en la cadena pública.

El descenso ha sido progresivo pero constante desde el regreso a la parrilla el 7 de enero.

Esta posición llega tras las amenazas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien advirtió que impondría aranceles del 100% a todos los bienes canadienses si Ottawa avanzaba en un pacto comercial con Pekín. Carney explicó que los recientes acuerdos alcanzados durante su visita a Pekín buscan únicamente resolver disputas comerciales de los últimos años, no establecer un tratado de libre comercio. En 2024, Canadá aplicó aranceles del 100% a vehículos eléctricos chinos y del 25% al acero y aluminio procedentes de China, lo que provocó represalias por parte de Pekín con tasas del 100% al aceite y harina de canola canadiense, y del 25% a la carne de cerdo y mariscos.

Según Starmer, la base es esencial para la lucha contra el terrorismo y para la inteligencia británica y estadounidense, garantizando la seguridad futura de ambas naciones. Por su parte, el expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump calificó la medida como un «acto de debilidad total», aunque reconoció que el archipiélago pertenece legalmente a Mauricio. Con la devolución, la base se incluirá en el acuerdo de Pelindaba, declarando África como zona libre de armas nucleares, lo que impide el almacenamiento de armas nucleares estadounidenses en Diego García. Esta decisión ha generado tensiones diplomáticas y ha sido interpretada por algunos analistas como un movimiento de Trump para intentar reafirmar la hegemonía de Estados Unid]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acuerdo-entre-reino-unido-y-mauricio-sobre-el-archipielago-de-chagos-y-la-base-de-diego-garcia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/acuerdo-entre-reino-unido-y-mauricio-sobre-el-archipielago-de-chagos-y-la-base-de-diego-garcia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tour EXCLUSIVO: Así fabrican y prueban el COHETE ESPAÑOL Miura-5]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra el proceso de fabricación y las pruebas a las que se somete el cohete español Miura-5.

Los poemas recogidos abarcan distintas etapas y registros de su obra, desde la denuncia directa de la violencia estructural y la explotación hasta la reflexión ética, el amor, la memoria y la duda.

En composiciones como “Muchas maneras de matar”, Brecht enumera las formas invisibles y normalizadas de la violencia ejercida por el Estado y el sistema económico, subrayando cómo muchas de ellas no están prohibidas pese a causar muerte y sufrimiento. Otros textos, como “Preguntas de un obrero ante un libro”, cuestionan la historia oficial y ponen el foco en los trabajadores anónimos que sostienen las grandes gestas atribuidas a reyes y héroes.

Esta tecnología supera las limitaciones de los filtros convencionales, que no retienen eficientemente partículas a escala nanométrica. El sistema combina un filtro metálico recubierto de óxido de magnesio y un polímero catiónico con un generador triboeléctrico que convierte energía mecánica en electricidad, eliminando la necesidad de energía externa. Además, el filtro es regenerable: al invertir el campo eléctrico, las partículas se desprenden y el filtro puede reutilizarse más de 20 veces sin pérdida de eficacia. Las pruebas con agua del grifo y de río confirmaron su efectividad en condiciones reales, cumpliendo los estándares de calidad de la OMS.

Desde el golpe de Estado en Brasil en 1964 que derrocó al presidente João Goulart hasta el golpe militar en Chile en 1973 contra Salvador Allende, la intervención estadounidense ha estado presente en diversos países de la región. La Operación Cóndor es un ejemplo de cooperación entre dictaduras latinoamericanas para perseguir a opositores políticos, mientras que episodios como el asesinato de un exministro de Allende en Washington muestran la complejidad de estas relaciones. A finales de los años 70 y principios de los 80, con presidentes como Jimmy Carter y Ronald Reagan, la política estadounidense osciló entre restablecer ciertos controles y apoyar regímenes autoritarios. Además de los aspectos políticos, el documental aborda la influencia económica de Estados Unidos en proyectos estratégicos como el Canal de Panamá y cómo la llegada de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/intervenciones-de-estados-unidos-en-america-latina-golpes-de-estado-y-dictaduras-en-los-ultimos-60-anos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Complutense aclara que no se requiere titulación para redactar contratos y cuestiona la acusación de intrusismo a Begoña Gómez]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Universidad Complutense de Madrid ha remitido un informe al juez Juan Carlos Peinado en el que aclara que, según la normativa vigente, no es necesario contar con una titulación específica para redactar pliegos de prescripciones técnicas en contratos universitarios.

Según el análisis, la primera semana, del 26 de enero al 1 de febrero, estará claramente marcada por el paso continuado de frentes asociados a sistemas de bajas presiones procedentes del Atlántico. Estas borrascas dejarán lluvias en la mayor parte de la Península y Baleares, con especial intensidad y persistencia en el oeste y el sur peninsular, y de forma muy destacada en Galicia.

El patrón atmosférico previsto favorecerá la entrada de vientos húmedos y relativamente templados, lo que tendrá un impacto directo en las temperaturas, que se situarán por encima de los valores normales para esta época del año. Como consecuencia, la nieve quedará en general restringida a zonas de montaña, sin episodios relevantes en cotas bajas]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aemet-preve-varias-semanas-marcadas-por-borrascas-atlanticas-lluvias-generalizadas-y-temperaturas-suaves</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aemet-preve-varias-semanas-marcadas-por-borrascas-atlanticas-lluvias-generalizadas-y-temperaturas-suaves</guid><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo los dispositivos que llevamos afectan nuestra privacidad y vigilancia diaria]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marta Peirano aborda en esta charla de TED cómo los dispositivos que usamos a diario, como smartphones y relojes inteligentes, actúan como herramientas de vigilancia constante.

Se trata de la undécima prórroga presupuestaria en la historia democrática de España y la tercera consecutiva con las cuentas de 2023, que ya rigieron en 2024 y 2025.

La investigación, centrada en la Cordillera Ibérica (provincia de Teruel), utiliza registros dendrocronológicos de Pinus sylvestris y Pinus nigra para reconstruir la precipitación acumulada en un periodo clave de crecimiento anual. Gracias a la combinación de nuevas muestras recogidas en 2024 y datos históricos previos, los autores han logrado una cronología robusta y bien replicada que permite ir mucho más allá del periodo cubierto por los registros meteorológicos instrumentales.

Los resultados muestran una fuerte variabilidad de la precipitación a lo largo de los siglos, con alternancia de periodos secos y húmedos.

La universidad ha emitido resoluciones de urgencia para evitar la pérdida de derechos por prescripción, pero carece de los recursos para efectuar los pagos. La UAL es la peor financiada de Andalucía, recibiendo 7.803 euros por estudiante frente a la media andaluza de 8.708 y la media nacional de 9.397 euros, lo que supone un déficit anual de entre 12 y 21 millones de euros.

Aunque el plan sigue siendo criticado por su complejidad y por afectar a inversores en acciones, bonos y criptomonedas que deberán tributar incluso sin haber vendido sus inversiones, la mayoría de los parlamentarios lo apoyará para evitar pérdidas anuales de aproximadamente 2.300 millones de euros para las arcas públicas. Entre los partidos que votarán a favor se encuentran VVD, CDA, JA21, BBB, PVV, D66 y GroenLinks-PvdA.

Se destaca la erosión de seis pilares fundamentales del poder estadounidense desde la posguerra: inmigración abierta, apoyo a la educación e investigación, comercio libre, estado de derecho, alianzas internacionales sólidas (como la OTAN) y una política monetaria independiente que respalda al dólar como moneda de reserva.

Según relataron los testigos, la mujer salió a la terraza del local con el animal y, cuando este se acercó a una mesa, lo levantó bruscamente tirando de la correa. A continuación, lo mantuvo suspendido en el aire mientras lo zarandeaba y le gritaba. Ante esta situación, varias personas le recriminaron su comportamiento, lo que provocó una reacción aún más violenta: la mujer comenzó a golpear al cachorro con patadas y puñetazos por distintas partes del cuerpo.

Según Guillen, numerosos extranjeros llegan a Barcelona y a localidades del entorno buscando una imagen estereotipada de lo ‘español’, asociada a la paella, el flamenco o una vida local pintoresca. Sin embargo, se encuentran con una realidad muy distinta: cafés donde se habla inglés u otros idiomas, menús de brunch similares a los de Londres y un estilo de vida globalizado, apoyado en salarios altos, teletrabajo y servicios financieros digitales.

En los años sesenta, el auge del automóvil y el desarrollismo impulsaron esta solución ambiciosa para un nudo viario clave donde confluían importantes avenidas y la estación de tren. Aunque inicialmente cumplió su objetivo de agilizar la circulación, pronto se convirtió en un elemento muy polémico por su impacto negativo: oscurecía la plaza, ocultaba edificios históricos, generaba ruido y contaminación, y convertía el espacio en hostil para los peatones, relegando la Fuente de la Alcachofa a un segundo plano.

La llegada de los efectivos se produjo en un contexto de fuerte tensión social, agravada por la difusión de un nuevo vídeo que muestra el desarrollo completo del encuentro entre Pretti y agentes federales del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional.

Las imágenes contradicen de forma significativa la versión inicial ofrecida por responsables de la administración Trump, que calificaron a Pretti como un terrorista doméstico con intención de causar el máximo daño a las fuerzas del orden.

El ave, cedida por el Gobierno de Aragón y equipada con un emisor satelital, fue localizada sin vida el domingo 18 de enero de 2026 en el límite entre los municipios cántabros de Peñarrubia y Cillorigo de Liébana, tras detectar los técnicos de la FCQ localizaciones anómalas.

A través de una experiencia directa, Jedeed logró ser reclutada en apenas seis minutos durante un acto de captación en Texas, lo que ilustra la drástica rebaja de los controles de acceso y de los estándares profesionales.

ICE ha pasado de contar con unos 10.000 agentes a sumar aproximadamente 12.000 más en un corto periodo de tiempo. Para lograrlo, la agencia ha eliminado límites de edad, reducido la formación a solo 48 días —casi la mitad de lo habitual— y suprimido cursos clave, como el aprendizaje de castellano. Además, se han introducido incentivos económicos de hasta 50.000 dólares para atraer candidatos.

El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, desmintió públicamente esta información y aclaró que los carriles fueron fabricados por ArcelorMittal, una compañía siderúrgica con presencia internacional pero con producción en España, concretamente en su planta de Gijón.

Puente explicó que los raíles cuentan con trazabilidad completa, incluyendo la identificación de la colada de acero empleada —de unas 200 toneladas— y de los profesionales responsables de las soldaduras. Estas uniones, según detalló, fueron sometidas a controles exhaustivos mediante ultrasonidos y fluidos, superando todas las inspecciones reglamentarias previas al accidente.

En 2007, la empresa Wakayama Electric Railway tomó una decisión inusual: nombrar a una gata tricolor llamada Tama como jefa de estación honoraria en la estación de Kishi. Esta iniciativa, que comenzó como una medida simbólica, se convirtió en un fenómeno turístico inesperado. Tama, vestida con un uniforme diminuto y con su propio despacho, atrajo a miles de visitantes, generó cobertura mediática internacional, trenes decorados con su imagen y una gran cantidad de merchandising. El impacto económico se estima en cientos de millones de yenes, logrando revertir la crisis y salvar la línea.

Sin embargo, Abad insistió en obtener respuestas concretas sobre la inversión en infraestructuras y la gestión de las incidencias en la red ferroviaria.

El debate se centra en los derechos constitucionales del detenido y en los límites de la actuación policial durante el arresto. La defensa de Mangione sostiene que el registro de la mochila vulneró la Cuarta Enmienda de la Constitución de Estados Unidos, que protege frente a registros e incautaciones indebidas, al no existir una orden ni concurrir circunstancias excepcionales que lo justificaran.

El verdadero potencial disruptivo radica en los bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, ya que los inversores europeos poseen alrededor de ocho billones de dólares en bonos y otros valores de EE.UU., financiando así gran parte de la enorme deuda americana. Una reestructuración coordinada de estas inversiones, retirando capital de la zona del dólar, podría generar graves problemas a un país altamente endeudado como Estados Unidos.

Su obra y pensamiento cuestionaron los límites de la tecnología, la libertad humana y lo que realmente nos hace humanos. A través de su escritura, anticipó avances científicos como la fecundación artificial y criticó la búsqueda de una felicidad impuesta por la sociedad, mostrando cómo esta puede derivar en desdicha y deshumanización. Además de su faceta literaria, Huxley estudió psicología, se interesó por experiencias visionarias con drogas y exploró la espiritualidad en obras como 'La filosofía perenne', donde identifica verdades compartidas por distintas tradiciones místicas. Su enseñanza más sencilla y revolucionaria, expresada al final de su vida, es que la amabilidad es clave para una existencia plena.

La intervención, que se llevó a cabo en apenas nueve horas durante la noche, permitió integrar tres líneas ferroviarias existentes —Ganlong, Ganruilong y Zhanglong— con una nueva vía de alta velocidad, minimizando el impacto sobre el tráfico ferroviario habitual.

El operativo movilizó a unos 1.500 trabajadores organizados bajo una planificación extremadamente precisa. Los ingenieros responsables dividieron al personal en siete unidades operativas que trabajaron de forma simultánea en tareas muy distintas: desde el movimiento de tierras y la pavimentación con asfalto y hormigón, hasta la instalación de sistemas de señalización, control y monitorización digital del tráfico ferroviario. Para ello se emplearon siete trenes de trabajo especializados y 23 excavadoras, coordinadas al ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-culmina-en-una-noche-la-remodelacion-y-conexion-de-una-estacion-ferroviaria-clave-en-longyan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-culmina-en-una-noche-la-remodelacion-y-conexion-de-una-estacion-ferroviaria-clave-en-longyan</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[España encabeza los descarrilamientos en Europa por insuficiente mantenimiento ferroviario]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante 2024, España registró 12 descarrilamientos, muy por encima de la media europea de 2,3 por país, lo que supone el 21% de los incidentes de este tipo en Europa en los últimos dos años, según Eurostat. Esta cifra convierte a España en el país con más descarrilamientos en el continente, superando a Francia y Alemania. Expertos en ingeniería ferroviaria señalan que la causa principal no es la mala suerte, sino fallos estructurales acumulativos en el mantenimiento de la infraestructura, especialmente en vías de alta afluencia de pasajeros como las líneas Madrid-Andalucía. La fatiga de los carriles, causada por el uso constante y la falta de mantenimiento adecuado, genera microgrietas que pueden derivar en accidentes graves, como el trágico descarrilamiento del tren Iryo en Adamuz que causó 45 muertos. Además, se destaca que España dedica solo un 16% del gasto anual al mantenimiento ferroviario, mientras que la media europea se sitúa en torno al 50%.

Siguiendo el consejo habitual, decidió no informar de su embarazo hasta el cuarto mes, momento en el que empezó a sentir molestias al levantar peso. Tras comunicarlo a su encargada, fue cambiada exclusivamente a la caja, una adaptación parcial a su situación. Poco después, notificó también a la central de la empresa. Horas más tarde, recibió una llamada informándole de que no había superado el periodo de prueba por 'valoraciones negativas' y 'rendimiento insuficiente', pese a no haber recibido ninguna queja previa.

Ante la gravedad, el conseller de Sanidad, Marciano Gómez, prometió medidas contundentes si se confirman irregularidades, aunque no aclaró si incluirían la rescisión del contrato. PSPV, Compromís y la Plataforma por la Reversión del Vinalopó exigen terminar la concesión y han anunciado acciones judiciales ante la Fiscalía, junto con protestas frente al hospital.

El contrato, prorrogado en mayo de 2025 hasta mayo de 2030, compromete a la Generalitat a pagar 826,7 millones de euros en total. Restando lo previsto para 2025, quedan pendientes 744,1 millones por los cuatro años restantes.

Uclés, conocido por obras como 'La Península de las casas vacías', que aborda la Guerra Civil española desde el realismo mágico, argumentó en un vídeo en redes sociales que no desea aparecer en el mismo cartel que el expresidente del Gobierno José María Aznar y el exdirigente de Vox Iván Espinosa de los Monteros.

En sus declaraciones, el autor aclaró que no se trata solo del título del evento —que considera inexacto al afirmar que 'todos perdimos' la guerra, cuando los republicanos fueron los derrotados y los franquistas se beneficiaron durante décadas—, sino principalmente por la presencia de estos dos políticos.

Una vecina lo halló muy delgado y débil en su jardín, y al llevarlo al veterinario, el microchip que llevaba desde 2018 permitió identificarlo inmediatamente. Los expertos destacan que los gatos poseen un extraordinario sentido de orientación, utilizando su olfato y memoria espacial, a veces siguiendo ríos o líneas eléctricas, lo que habría permitido a Filou recorrer carreteras peligrosas y zonas urbanas durante meses, a pesar de la deshidratación y las heridas.

Las grabaciones revelan que Pretti actuó en defensa de dos personas durante un operativo contra migrantes, contradiciendo las afirmaciones de que atacó a los funcionarios con un arma. En las imágenes, se observa a Pretti grabando la escena con su teléfono móvil mientras se enfrenta pacíficamente a los agentes. En un primer vídeo, retrocede tras ser empujado por un oficial. En otro, dirige el tráfico para permitir el paso de un vehículo, mientras otros ciudadanos protestan tocando silbatos, una práctica común en la zona para alertar sobre redadas migratorias ordenadas por la administración Trump.

La historia, difundida por el programa “Andalucía Directo” de Canal Sur, pone el foco en un caso concreto que refleja problemas estructurales relacionados con la vivienda y la actuación de los fondos de inversión.

La casa en cuestión no es solo el lugar donde Fran ha vivido siempre, sino también el espacio donde nació y un inmueble adaptado específicamente a sus necesidades de movilidad reducida. El origen del conflicto se remonta a años atrás, cuando su padre utilizó la vivienda como aval para una finca, lo que acabó derivando en la pérdida de la propiedad y su posterior adquisición por un fondo de inversión. Desde entonces, Fran se enfrentaba a la posibilidad real de tener que abandonar su hogar.

Lejos de apartarla de la primera línea política, ese relato sirvió para reforzar su perfil de dirigente dura y sin escrúpulos a la hora de ejecutar decisiones impopulares.

El autor, Ángel L.

La trama arranca con un escritor especializado en lo paranormal que ayuda a un amigo a investigar una casa aparentemente ideal pero con un plano extraño que esconde algo perturbador. Junto a un delineante, descubren que no se trata de errores de diseño, sino de estructuras deliberadas para ocultar secretos oscuros, posiblemente violentos.

El país dispone de unas 3.352 toneladas de oro, las segundas mayores reservas del mundo tras las de Estados Unidos, con un valor aproximado de 450.000 millones de euros. De ese total, alrededor de 1.236 toneladas —casi la mitad del valor— se encuentran en suelo estadounidense.

La controversia surge en un contexto de creciente desconfianza hacia la política exterior y económica de Donald Trump. Sus recientes decisiones militares y presiones diplomáticas han llevado a expertos, economistas y responsables políticos alemanes a plantear si el oro podría convertirse en un instrumento de presión geopolítica.

Según la investigación en curso, la causa más probable fue la rotura del carril derecho precisamente en el punto donde se une material renovado recientemente con carriles antiguos fabricados en 1989, en la época de inauguración de la línea en 1992. La renovación del tramo Guadalmez-Córdoba, adjudicada en 2022 por 60 millones de euros y terminada en gran parte en mayo de 2025, se realizó de forma parcial: solo se renovó el desvío de agujas, dejando intacto el tramo recto donde ocurrió el siniestro.

Niccolò Fontana, conocido como Tartaglia, desarrolló un método secreto para resolver ecuaciones cúbicas y lo mantuvo oculto tras vencer en duelos matemáticos públicos. Gerolamo Cardano, ambicioso autor de Ars Magna, convenció a Tartaglia para que le revelara la fórmula bajo juramento solemne de secreto, prometiendo no publicarla. Sin embargo, Cardano la incluyó en su obra de 1545, rompiendo el juramento y atribuyéndola principalmente a sí mismo, aunque mencionó a Tartaglia y a Scipione del Ferro.

Al aplicar la fórmula, surgió el 'casus irreducibilis': ecuaciones con tres raíces reales evidentes producían expresiones con raíces cuadradas de números negativos, consideradas absurdas por Cardano. Rafael Bombelli, en 1572, aceptó estas cantidades 'imposibles' como legítimas y manipuló algebraicamente expresiones como la raíz cúbica de (2 + √(-121))]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-la-traicion-de-cardano-a-tartaglia-impulso-el-descubrimiento-de-los-numeros-complejos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump anuncia que no asistirá al Super Bowl y critica la elección de Bad Bunny y Green Day como artistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ha declarado en una entrevista con The New York Times que no asistirá al Super Bowl del próximo 8 de febrero de 2026, que se celebrará en el Levi's Stadium de Santa Clara, California. Aunque expresó que le gustaría ir y que en ediciones anteriores ha sido bien recibido, justificó su ausencia principalmente por la distancia del evento. Sin embargo, aprovechó para criticar duramente la selección de los artistas: el puertorriqueño Bad Bunny, encargado del espectáculo del medio tiempo, y el grupo Green Day, que participará en la ceremonia de apertura. Trump afirmó estar 'en contra' de ambos, calificando su elección como 'pésima' y acusándolos de 'sembrar odio'. Bad Bunny ha sido un crítico abierto de las políticas antimigratorias de Trump, mientras que Billie Joe Armstrong, vocalista de Green Day, ha apoyado recientemente las protestas en Minneapolis contra las redadas del ICE (Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas).

En 2024, el Gobierno groenlandés vetó el uso de Starlink, la constelación de satélites de órbita baja de Elon Musk, debido a sus vínculos con el Gobierno estadounidense y el Pentágono, considerándola un riesgo para la soberanía y la seguridad nacional en un contexto de posibles guerras híbridas. En su lugar, el operador nacional Tusass ha reforzado acuerdos con infraestructuras europeas. Desde 2023, varios asentamientos remotos del norte y este de Groenlandia acceden a internet mediante el satélite geoestacionario Amazonas Nexus, operado por la española Hispasat.

El autor argumenta que Abascal no merece ser calificado de 'extrema derecha' en el sentido ideológico clásico, sino que lo tacha de 'extremo comepollas' por su supuesto servilismo y apoyo entusiasta a las políticas del Gobierno de Estados Unidos y a lo que describe como 'masacre sionista'. En concreto, señala que Abascal aplaude las redadas migratorias ('la migra') en EE.UU. y las toma como inspiración para aplicarlas en España. El texto contextualiza este posicionamiento en el supuesto miedo anglosajón a la creciente hispanización del sur de Estados Unidos, donde la población hispana demográficamente empuja con fuerza y el uso del español se extiende.

El anuncio fue realizado por la presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, quien subrayó el valor científico del hallazgo al tratarse de un contexto funerario prácticamente intacto, capaz de aportar información directa sobre la organización social, los rituales y la cosmovisión zapoteca durante el periodo Clásico.

La tumba presenta una arquitectura compleja, con antecámara y cámara funeraria, en la que cada elemento escultórico y pictórico posee un significado simbólico preciso.

El trabajo contextualiza el uso de las sanciones como una herramienta recurrente de presión política y económica sobre países del denominado Sur Global, especialmente aquellos que han intentado desarrollar políticas soberanas al margen de los intereses occidentales.

El neurocientífico Michel Desmurget, en su conferencia 'La lectura en 2050' del Instituto Diderot, afirma que mientras los cómics tienen un efecto cognitivo casi nulo, los medios digitales como redes sociales o mensajes cortos tienen incluso un impacto negativo en el cerebro. Leer libros desarrolla el coeficiente intelectual, la concentración, la síntesis y la creatividad, e incluso mejora el rendimiento matemático, algo que la exposición constante a pantallas fragmenta gravemente.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las 9:30 de la mañana en la intersección de East 34th Street y Portland Avenue. Según testigos, varios agentes intentaron acceder al vehículo de Good (un Honda Pilot rojo) y uno de ellos abrió fuego a través de la ventanilla del conductor tras un forcejeo con la puerta.

Los hechos, según quedó acreditado en la vista judicial, describen un patrón prolongado de violencia sexual ejercida en el ámbito doméstico, en el que la víctima fue drogada de manera reiterada para facilitar las agresiones.

Según fuentes citadas por el medio Politico, una de las opciones que se barajan en Washington es la imposición de un bloqueo naval destinado a impedir la llegada de cargamentos de petróleo, como parte de una estrategia más amplia orientada a forzar un cambio político en el país caribeño.

La posible medida contaría con el respaldo de sectores críticos con el Gobierno cubano dentro de la propia Administración y del secretario de Estado, Marco Rubio, aunque no existe todavía una decisión definitiva. El debate interno gira en torno a si es necesario llegar a ese extremo, dado que el corte del petróleo venezolano —tras el endurecimiento de sanciones y restricciones a buques— ya ha tenido un impacto significativo en la economía cubana, que lleva años en una situación de semiparálisis.

Según un audio filtrado y divulgado por el periodista Orlando Avendaño, Rodríguez relató que ella, junto a Diosdado Cabello y Jorge Rodríguez, recibieron un ultimátum de solo 15 minutos para responder a demandas estadounidenses y 'recuperar el control de la narrativa' tras la eliminación de Maduro como figura central del régimen, bajo amenaza de ser neutralizados o asesinados. El audio, que data de los días posteriores al operativo, revela que el régimen chavista no anticipaba la escala del ataque militar estadounidense en Caracas, descrito por Rodríguez como una intervención 'impecable y devastadora' que incluyó bombardeos en la capital venezolana. Afirmó que Venezuela contemplaba posibles acciones desde Washington, pero no de tal magnitud, llegando a calificar el asalto c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-denuncia-en-audio-filtrado-amenazas-de-estados-unidos-tras-la-captura-de-nicolas-maduro-en-caracas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/delcy-rodriguez-denuncia-en-audio-filtrado-amenazas-de-estados-unidos-tras-la-captura-de-nicolas-maduro-en-caracas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno aprueba el anteproyecto de Ley de Crédito al Consumo que prohíbe conceder créditos no solicitados y limita costes en revolving y microcréditos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de España ha aprobado el anteproyecto de Ley sobre Crédito al Consumo, que transpone directivas europeas y refuerza la protección de los consumidores frente al sobreendeudamiento. La norma prohíbe expresamente a los bancos y entidades conceder créditos, emitir tarjetas de crédito o ampliar límites de financiación sin solicitud previa y consentimiento expreso del cliente. Esta medida aborda prácticas habituales en el sector, como el envío de tarjetas no pedidas o el incremento unilateral de líneas de crédito, que ya estaban parcialmente limitadas por la Ley de Servicios de Pagos, pero ahora se endurecen.

La regulación abarca un amplio espectro de productos: préstamos personales, microcréditos, créditos rápidos, pagos fraccionados tipo 'buy now, pay later' y tarjetas revolving. Se establecen límites al coste del crédito para evitar la usura, con especial énfasis en los productos más caros, como las revolving y los descubiertos en cuenta.

Los Chromebooks, portátiles económicos basados en ChromeOS, han sido distribuidos en centros educativos no solo por su bajo coste y facilidad de uso, sino también como parte de una estrategia para que los niños se acostumbren a su ecosistema tecnológico. El informe de Google indica que si un usuario empieza a usar un sistema operativo o plataformas como YouTube desde temprana edad, es más probable que continúe utilizándolos en la vida adulta, generando así fidelidad a la marca. Aunque ChromeOS representa actualmente solo el 1,24% del mercado de ordenadores, la compañía considera que su presencia en escuelas puede influir en futuras decisiones de compra.

Sin embargo, al llegar la noche, quedaron atrapadas al no haber asegurado ningún medio de transporte para el regreso. La línea de autobús 692 (la principal conexión pública) ya había finalizado su servicio, recortado además por la borrasca, y ninguno de los excursionistas disponía de vehículo propio ni de cadenas u otros medios para descender por sus propios medios.

Las condiciones meteorológicas eran extremas: temperaturas bajo cero, visibilidad muy reducida y fuerte temporal de nieve. Ante el riesgo inminente de hipotermia por exposición prolongada al frío, se activó un dispositivo de rescate coordinado por Emergencias 112 de la Comunidad de Madrid.

En 2025, al menos 30 personas fallecieron bajo custodia, la cifra más alta desde 2004 y superior al total registrado durante los cuatro años de la administración de Joe Biden, que sumó 26 muertes. A finales de 2025, más de 68 mil adultos estaban detenidos por el ICE, frente a 36 mil en 2023. En los primeros días de 2026, ya se registraron seis muertes adicionales, incluyendo casos de suicidio y problemas de salud relacionados con el corazón. Observadores externos, como la ACLU, han denunciado que hasta el 95% de estas muertes podrían haberse prevenido con atención médica adecuada, revelando retrasos y tratamientos inapropiados en los centros de detención.

Sus padres, Ernesto Alonso y Marbella Carranza, intentaron buscar apoyo médico y económico para su hospitalización mediante una campaña en GoFundMe, pero el estado de salud de la niña se deterioró rápidamente y no sobrevivió. La familia denunció que las autoridades escolares no actuaron ante las reiteradas denuncias de acoso, dejando a Jocelynn sin protección.

A raíz de recientes descarrilamientos en Córdoba, el recuerdo de aquella tragedia vuelve a primer plano tras conocerse una sentencia que exculpa al exjefe de seguridad de Adif y atribuye toda la responsabilidad al maquinista.

La información detalla cómo, pese a la rápida llegada de vecinos y servicios de emergencia, el rescate estuvo marcado por fallos de coordinación: retrasos de más de dos horas en declarar el nivel de alerta adecuado, ausencia de un puesto de mando avanzado durante casi dos horas, falta de medios técnicos y dependencia de teléfonos móviles para dirigir el operativo.

En ese contexto, los agentes encontraron al guardia civil conversando con una mujer y este se identificó mostrando su placa.

Para justificar su presencia, el agente afirmó estar interrogando a una confidente dentro de una operación confidencial contra el narcotráfico. Llegó incluso a asegurar que pertenecía a la unidad OCON-Sur, especializada en la lucha contra el narcotráfico en el Campo de Gibraltar.

Desde 2024, la partida para cooperación ha pasado de unos 450.000 euros anuales a quedarse en 220.000 euros, una reducción cercana al 50% que ya está afectando de forma directa a proyectos humanitarios y al funcionamiento de entidades con décadas de trayectoria. Según la Coordinadora Granadina de ONGs (CONGRA), estas ayudas no son complementarias, sino estructurales, y su desaparición pone en riesgo iniciativas esenciales.

El recorte se produce en un contexto económico que, según las asociaciones, no lo justifica. El presupuesto de la Diputación para 2026 asciende a 418,5 millones de euros, con superávit previsto y deuda cero.

Según el artículo, la presión asistencial ha aumentado un 30% respecto a picos históricos previos, afectando a hospitales de prácticamente todas las comunidades autónomas. Las urgencias se han convertido en la puerta de entrada al sistema sanitario debido al progresivo desmantelamiento de la Atención Primaria, incapaz de absorber la demanda por falta de financiación, personal y recursos.

Esta saturación impacta especialmente en la población sin seguros privados, que representa alrededor del 60%, y que ve deteriorada la calidad y seguridad de la atención recibida. Pacientes son atendidos en pasillos, sillas o camillas improvisadas, mientras el personal sanitario soporta sobrecargas laborales que generan un grave desgaste físico y emocional.

Trump sugirió en una entrevista que los aliados enviaron tropas pero «se quedaron un poco atrás, un poco fuera de las líneas del frente», lo que ha generado indignación en Reino Unido. Starmer rindió homenaje a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en la misión y subrayó que nunca olvidará su valentía y sacrificio. El príncipe Harry también intervino, afirmando que los sacrificios de los soldados británicos merecen «ser hablados con verdad y respeto».

La víctima, que se encontraba en proceso de separación de su expareja, salió a la calle pidiendo auxilio antes de desplomarse. Un vecino o familiar accedió al domicilio y la encontró en el suelo en un charco de sangre junto a un cuchillo de cocina, que fue intervenido como arma del crimen.

Los servicios sanitarios del 112-Andalucía confirmaron el fallecimiento en el lugar.

El suceso ocurrió alrededor de las cinco de la tarde en el lugar de O Castro, en la parroquia de Seixo, cuando el afectado se encontraba realizando trabajos de soldadura en un galpón anexo a su vivienda.

Según informaron fuentes sanitarias, el hombre procedió a cortar una bombona que creía vacía por motivos que no han trascendido. Sin embargo, el cilindro aún contenía gas en su interior y, al entrar en contacto con la herramienta eléctrica, se produjo una fuerte explosión que destrozó por completo el galpón. Como consecuencia del estallido, el hombre sufrió heridas de gravedad, entre ellas una profunda brecha en la frente, por lo que fue evacuado de urgencia en una UVI móvil al Hospital de Montecelo, en Pontevedra.

Lejos de investigarse los hechos, la Administración Trump ha calificado a la víctima de “terrorista” sin aportar pruebas y ha mantenido la impunidad del agente implicado, lo que ha actuado como detonante de una respuesta social masiva.

El Congreso andorrano dio luz verde a un proyecto de ley que introduce cambios en la normativa migratoria, fiscal y de vivienda, con especial impacto sobre grandes fortunas, inversores extranjeros y trabajadores por cuenta propia como youtubers e influencers.

El objetivo principal de la reforma es contener la especulación inmobiliaria en un territorio con una superficie muy limitada y un mercado de vivienda tensionado. Según expertos legales, el auge descontrolado de la inversión en inmuebles había elevado de forma significativa los precios, dificultando el acceso a la vivienda para la población residente. Para corregir esta situación, la nueva normativa incrementa el impuesto por la compra de vivienda del 3% al 6% sobre el valor de adquisición.

Junto a su esposa Marcolina Argüelles, también luchadora por la libertad, formó una familia pese a las dificultades y recibió homenaje por su trayectoria en 2022 en La Felguera.

El programa utiliza fondos públicos del American Rescue Plan Act para comprar deudas médicas a hospitales y agencias de cobro por una fracción de su valor y, posteriormente, anularlas por completo. No existe un proceso de solicitud: las personas beneficiarias reciben una carta en su domicilio informándoles de que parte o la totalidad de su deuda ha sido eliminada.

Madrid, sostiene, se ha vuelto previsible, convertida en un producto que responde a una estrategia de marketing urbano basada en atraer talento, turistas e inversiones, más que en cuidar la vida cotidiana de quienes la habitan.

Bravo critica la transformación de la ciudad en una marca que prioriza restaurantes de moda, grandes eventos y campañas publicitarias, fomentando la segmentación social y el individualismo.

La historia sigue a una mujer embarazada que se refugia en una choza abandonada en una montaña nevada, huyendo de una situación de opresión y violencia. Dirigiéndose en segunda persona a su hija nonata, la protagonista mantiene un diálogo íntimo y esperanzador mientras enfrenta el aislamiento, el frío y la precariedad. El narrador, dubitativo e impersonal, adopta un tono cíclico y letánico, centrado en los elementos naturales (montaña, nieve, animales) y en la sonoridad del lenguaje.

A diferencia de relatos de supervivencia épicos o históricos, esta obra prescinde casi por completo de anclajes temporales y geográficos concretos —salvo sutiles evocaciones rifeñas—, lo que le confiere una dimensión universal.

Al incluir el impacto sobre ecosistemas marinos, pesca, infraestructuras costeras, arrecifes de coral y manglares —el llamado “capital azul”—, el coste por tonelada de CO₂ emitida pasa de unos 51 dólares a cerca de 97 dólares, lo que supone un incremento de aproximadamente el 91%.

Este dato es crucial porque el coste social del carbono es la base sobre la que se diseñan políticas públicas como los impuestos al carbono o los sistemas de comercio de emisiones.

Estos pertenecen a la llamada 'quinta gama': alimentos cocinados de forma industrial, envasados al vacío o en atmósfera controlada, y listos para calentar y servir mediante horno o microondas. Según la Federación Española de Hostelería y Restauración (FEHR), la mayoría de los locales incorporan en mayor o menor medida este tipo de productos, motivados por el ahorro en personal, tiempo y equipamiento, ya que no requieren fogones ni cocineros especializados.

A diferencia de los precocinados ultraprocesados de supermercado, cargados de aditivos, grasas y azúcares, la quinta gama busca mantener sabor, textura y apariencia similares a lo casero, minimizando conservantes artificiales. Sin embargo, la Confederación de Consumidores y Usuarios (CECU) denuncia la falta de transparencia: los clientes pagan precios de]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cocina-de-quinta-gama-se-extiende-en-los-restaurantes-espanoles-por-ahorro-de-costes-pero-falta-transparencia-hacia-el-cliente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-cocina-de-quinta-gama-se-extiende-en-los-restaurantes-espanoles-por-ahorro-de-costes-pero-falta-transparencia-hacia-el-cliente</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El declive de la vida comunitaria y el papel del capitalismo frente al discurso xenófobo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo reflexiona sobre la nostalgia, compartida por distintas generaciones, hacia una comunidad vecinal hoy prácticamente desaparecida: barrios y pueblos donde existían relaciones cotidianas de apoyo mutuo, conocimiento personal entre vecinos y una sociabilidad intensa que generaba vínculos afectivos estables. El autor sostiene que esta añoranza es comprensible, ya que los seres humanos necesitamos lazos sociales, incluso de baja intensidad, para nuestro bienestar.

Sin embargo, el texto desmonta el argumento habitual de la extrema derecha que atribuye la desaparición de esa comunidad a la inmigración. El razonamiento es simple pero erróneo: si la comunidad se diluye al mismo tiempo que llegan nuevos vecinos de otros países, se concluye que estos son los responsables. Para refutarlo, el autor pone como ejemplo las urbanizaciones de clase media en las periferias urbanas, formadas casi exclusivamente por población nativa y homogénea, donde no existe una vida comunitaria fuerte y, d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-de-la-vida-comunitaria-y-el-papel-del-capitalismo-frente-al-discurso-xenofobo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-de-la-vida-comunitaria-y-el-papel-del-capitalismo-frente-al-discurso-xenofobo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Audiencia Nacional procesa a Claudio Rivas por un fraude de IVA en hidrocarburos de más de 70 millones]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Audiencia Nacional ha acordado procesar al empresario Claudio Rivas, presunto socio de Víctor de Aldama, por su supuesta implicación en un fraude millonario en el sector de los hidrocarburos cometido entre los años 2016 y 2018. El magistrado Antonio Piña considera que existen indicios suficientes para sentar en el banquillo a Rivas y a otras 21 personas por delitos contra la Hacienda Pública, falsedad documental, blanqueo de capitales y pertenencia a organización criminal, relacionados con un fraude de más de 70 millones de euros en el pago del IVA.

Esta causa es independiente del conocido como ‘caso Hidrocarburos’, en el que Rivas y Aldama llegaron a ingresar en prisión preventiva por una presunta defraudación de 182,5 millones de euros en IVA entre 2022 y 2024 a través de la empresa Villafuel, investigada por el juez Santiago Pedraz.

Según los datos oficiales de Adif, la inversión ha experimentado un fuerte incremento en los últimos años: de aproximadamente 1.700 millones de euros en 2017 se ha pasado a cerca de 5.000 millones en 2025, con 4.700 millones ya ejecutados hasta noviembre de ese año. Este crecimiento supone una triplicación de la cifra respecto al periodo anterior.

El análisis compara diferentes etapas políticas. Durante el mandato de Mariano Rajoy (2012-2018), las inversiones se redujeron significativamente (hasta un 16% en algunos periodos y un 60% en comparación con los años previos a la crisis), alcanzando mínimos en 2016 con 1.657 millones.

Un vehículo que participaba en dicha concentración se salió de la vía por el margen derecho en un cruce, arrollando a varios peatones que se encontraban en un paso de cebra y en la acera contigua. El suceso dejó un balance de nueve personas heridas: tres de ellas en estado grave y seis con lesiones leves, según el comunicado oficial de la Guardia Civil (aunque algunas fuentes mencionan variaciones en la gravedad). Todos los peatones afectados fueron trasladados al Hospital de Cabueñes para recibir atención médica.

Esta omisión estuvo vinculada al racismo y la esclavitud, permitiendo que los estados sureños excluyeran sistemáticamente a la población negra del sistema electoral. La XV enmienda, tras la Guerra Civil, introdujo el derecho a voto para ciudadanos sin distinción de raza, color o condición de exesclavo, pero dejó otras posibles restricciones intactas. Los tribunales y legisladores sureños aprovecharon estas lagunas mediante exámenes de alfabetización, impuestos y cláusulas de abuelo, que limitaron de facto el voto de los afroamericanos durante décadas, dando lugar a las leyes de segregación Jim Crow.

El estudio subraya que en 2025 el número de milmillonarios superó los 3.000, mientras que figuras como Elon Musk acumulan fortunas de cientos de miles de millones de dólares. Este fenómeno contrasta con una realidad global marcada por la pobreza: la mitad de la población mundial vive con menos de 8,3 dólares al día y más de una cuarta parte sufre inseguridad alimentaria.

Inicialmente, la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, compartió una foto donde Armstrong aparecía con rostro sereno. Media hora después, la Casa Blanca publicó la misma imagen pero digitalmente alterada para mostrarla llorando, con la boca abierta y la frente arrugada. La publicación añadía un texto que la calificaba como 'agitadora de extrema izquierda' y no especificaba que la imagen había sido modificada. No quedó claro si se utilizó inteligencia artificial o software de edición tradicional para la alteración.

Se menciona como ejemplo la obra de William Gayley Simpson, un ex pastor que se convirtió en un influyente ideólogo neonazi en Estados Unidos, autor de un libro racista que buscaba radicalizar a la población blanca contra judíos e inmigrantes.

La gobernadora, Kathy Hochul, anunció la medida como parte de una estrategia preventiva para facilitar la movilización de recursos y garantizar la seguridad de la población frente a un fenómeno meteorológico que podría tener un impacto significativo. Según los servicios meteorológicos, se esperan intensas nevadas, temperaturas extremadamente bajas, acumulaciones de hielo, fuertes rachas de viento y una ola de frío que podría provocar cortes de electricidad y la caída de árboles.

Se trata de la fase theta del nitruro de tantalio, capaz de transportar el calor a una velocidad cercana a los 1.100 W/m·K, casi tres veces superior a la del cobre, que hasta ahora era el estándar en sistemas de disipación térmica.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista Science, supone un cambio relevante en la comprensión de cómo se transporta el calor en los metales. Durante décadas, se asumía que la interacción entre electrones y fonones imponía un límite difícil de superar. Sin embargo, la estructura atómica del nitruro de tantalio en fase theta —con átomos de tantalio dispuestos en un patrón hexagonal y nitrógeno intercalado— reduce de forma drástica la fricción térmica interna, permitiendo un flujo de calor mucho más eficiente.

Según el medio, los reservistas finlandeses obtuvieron resultados tan superiores frente a las tropas estadounidenses que la dirección del ejercicio llegó a pedirles que redujeran la presión para evitar una sensación de humillación y desmoralización en las fuerzas de EE. UU.

En el ejercicio, diseñado para probar la capacidad operativa de la OTAN en condiciones árticas extremas, los soldados finlandeses actuaron como fuerza atacante, mientras que las unidades estadounidenses, incluidas tropas del Cuerpo de Marines y del Ejército de Tierra, asumieron el papel defensivo. De acuerdo con fuentes militares citadas por The Times, los finlandeses demostraron una notable ventaja táctica y operativa, especialmente en combate y maniobras en clima frío.

Cameron destacó que Nueva Zelanda logró eliminar el virus en dos ocasiones y que, cuando reapareció en una variante mutada, el país ya contaba con una tasa de vacunación cercana al 98%. Frente a esto, contrastó la situación estadounidense, donde la vacunación se quedó en torno al 62% y, según él, siguió una tendencia descendente. Para el director, esta diferencia refleja una brecha más profunda: la capacidad de una sociedad para actuar de forma cohesionada y basar sus decisiones en el conocimiento científico.

La investigación, que analizó el comportamiento de un amplio número de perros, encontró que aproximadamente el 10% de los perros salchicha exhiben rasgos agresivos, una proporción significativamente mayor que la media de otras razas. Los investigadores atribuyen esta tendencia a una combinación de factores genéticos, históricos y de entrenamiento. Históricamente, los perros salchicha fueron criados para cazar tejones y otros animales subterráneos, lo que requería valentía y determinación, características que podrían haber contribuido a su predisposición a la agresividad. Si bien el estudio ofrece una perspectiva interesante sobre el comportamiento de esta raza, es crucial recordar que la genética no es el único factor determinante.

A partir de un estudio que señala que la mitad de la población española admite odiar a alguien o a algún colectivo, el autor cuestiona la mala reputación general del término y propone distinguir entre un odio destructivo y un odio dirigido contra quienes ejercen la opresión o la violencia.

Tecé argumenta que el odio, entendido como rechazo firme hacia determinadas actitudes o estructuras de poder, ha sido históricamente un motor de cambio social. Ejemplifica esta idea con el rechazo hacia el esclavismo, el nazismo, el machismo o la explotación laboral, señalando que sin una aversión clara hacia estas realidades no habría habido avances en derechos humanos.

Fanone, quien sufrió graves lesiones durante el ataque y posteriormente se jubiló de la policía, ha sido un crítico de la respuesta política a los eventos del 6 de enero y ha entrevistado previamente al líder de Dropkick Murphys, Ken Casey.

A pesar del riesgo inminente, el expresidente Donald Trump aprovechó la situación para minimizar la relevancia del cambio climático, publicando en Truth Social comentarios irónicos que cuestionan la existencia del calentamiento global y lo califican de 'estafa'. La postura de Trump y de muchos miembros del Partido Republicano ha sido históricamente escéptica frente a la ciencia climática, a pesar de que organismos como la NOAA explican que olas de frío extremo no contradicen el calentamiento global. De hecho, el cambio climático puede incluso aumentar la intensidad de algunas tormentas invernales al aportar más humedad y energía térmica a la atmósfera.

Sin embargo, esta estrategia no ha tenido el efecto deseado. Los datos muestran un crecimiento significativo en las ventas de coches chinos en Europa, destacando especialmente a marcas como MG y BYD. MG finalizó el año en el puesto 16 del mercado europeo, superando a marcas consolidadas como CUPRA, Nissan y Fiat. Por su parte, BYD ascendió al puesto 22, superando a Suzuki, MINI y Mazda. En total, los fabricantes chinos vendieron más de 810.000 unidades en 2025, lo que supone un incremento del 99% respecto a 2024, y representando aproximadamente uno de cada diez coches nuevos vendidos en Europa.

La nota recuerda que Trump aprendió de su abogado Roy Cohn una estrategia basada en la mentira sistemática, el ataque a las autoridades y la manipulación de la opinión pública. Tras los rumores de una posible intervención militar en Groenlandia y el anuncio de precios exorbitantes por el territorio, Trump ha creado una especie de versión personal de la ONU, denominada 'Junta de Paz', que preside él mismo y en la que ya ha puesto a la venta sillones de miembros permanentes por mil millones de dólares cada uno.

El tribunal argumentó que las tuberías son infraestructura civil, no militar, y que las acciones encubiertas no están cubiertas por el derecho internacional humanitario, ya que no hay pruebas de que actuara con uniforme o órdenes estatales explícitas. Por ello, el sospechoso será juzgado por violar la seguridad interna de Alemania y atentar contra su soberanía, e incluso podría investigarse como crimen de guerra por atacar instalaciones civiles.

El fuerte oleaje y la erosión marina provocados por el temporal dejaron al descubierto una serie de estructuras sumergidas frente a la actual ciudad de Nabeul que podrían corresponder a la antigua Neápolis, una ciudad de origen púnico que más tarde fue romanizada y cuya localización exacta llevaba siglos siendo objeto de debate.

Según los investigadores, las ruinas visibles incluyen muros, bloques de piedra y trazados urbanos que sugieren la existencia de un asentamiento costero de cierta entidad. Las fuentes clásicas ya mencionaban que Neápolis sufrió un devastador maremoto en el siglo IV d.C., un desastre natural que habría provocado el hundimiento parcial de la ciudad bajo el mar. Los nuevos restos observados encajan con esta descripción histórica y refuerzan la hipótesis de que una parte significativa del núcleo urbano quedó sumergida de forma permanente.

La decisión, tomada por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), ha causado sorpresa e indignación entre los fiscales federales, que tenían previsto llevar al acusado a juicio y solicitar una pena de hasta 15 años de prisión.

Presilla Flores estaba acusado, junto a otras seis personas, de vigilar un camión blindado de la empresa Brinks en 2022 y aprovechar una parada en un área de descanso rural al norte de Los Ángeles para sustraer diamantes, esmeraldas, rubíes, oro y relojes de lujo.

Según la experta Profesora Helen Roy, del UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology y la Universidad de Exeter, este fenómeno se debe a varios factores favorables: un invierno benigno que permitió una buena emergencia de mariquitas tras la hibernación, una abundancia temprana de pulgones (su principal alimento) gracias a una primavera seca, y periodos de calor y humedad en verano que aceleraron su ciclo vital y reproducción.

Muchas de las mariquitas avistadas podrían ser de la especie arlequín, invasora y propensa a agruparse en grandes números, especialmente en paredes soleadas o en interiores buscando refugio. A pesar de las apariencias, las mariquitas son completamente inofensivas para humanos y mascotas: no pican, no son venenosas y no transmiten enfermedades.

El caso, que involucra una importante cantidad de cocaína, ha generado controversia por la fragilidad de las pruebas presentadas por la acusación. Los abogados defensores argumentaron que la investigación carecía de solidez y que no existían pruebas concluyentes que ligaran a sus clientes con el alijo. La sentencia, dictada tras un juicio celebrado entre noviembre y diciembre de 2025, no es firme y puede ser recurrida ante el Tribunal Supremo.

Según el documento, las muestras de la vía fueron retiradas bajo supervisión de la Policía Judicial y trasladadas a Madrid para su análisis, junto con los registradores de datos tanto del tren accidentado como de un tren Alvia que circulaba por la misma línea. Este primer informe refuerza la hipótesis de que la fractura en el raíl pudo existir antes del paso del tren, aunque la investigación sigue abierta y se esperan más conclusiones.

La presidenta madrileña reivindicó la figura de Gregorio Ordóñez en un acto del PP por el 31 aniversario de su asesinato, para criticar al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez por supuestamente 'blanquear' a ETA y plantear si un nuevo político como él tendría que vivir escoltado hoy en día. Ordóñez acusó al PP de practicar un odio más cruel que el recibido en su día de la izquierda abertzale, denominando al partido de 'derecha abertzale'. Afirmó que su hermano sería considerado un 'hereje' por el PP actual, ya que defendía los derechos ciudadanos sin exaltar patrias ni banderas (salvo la de Donostia), trataba a los adversarios con respeto y confiaba en la rebelión ciudadana contra ETA, no en discursos altisonantes.

La colisión ocurrió en un tramo gestionado por un consorcio de empresas privadas que construyen, mantienen y supervisan sus propios trabajos, lo que según los sindicatos de maquinistas ha reducido significativamente el control público sobre la seguridad. A pesar de la histórica inversión estatal de 4.500 millones de euros en 2024, la mayor parte se destinó a nuevas infraestructuras de alta velocidad, mientras que el mantenimiento de la red convencional quedó insuficientemente financiado. En Catalunya, por ejemplo, entre 2015 y 2022 solo se ejecutó un tercio del presupuesto previsto, reflejando un deterioro en los servicios y un aumento de averías.

El tribunal confirma la pena de dos años y seis meses de prisión impuesta al maquinista Francisco Garzón Amo como autor de 79 delitos de homicidio y 143 de lesiones por imprudencia grave. Los magistrados concluyen que el descarrilamiento se debió exclusivamente a la distracción del conductor, quien circulaba a casi 200 km/h en una curva limitada a 80 km/h mientras mantenía una conversación telefónica innecesaria con el interventor, ignorando señales visuales y acústicas. Se descarta la falta de formación o desconocimiento del tramo por parte del maquinista.

Durante la inspección del material rodante se han detectado muescas en las ruedas del lado derecho de varios coches del Iryo, compatibles con el impacto contra un carril previamente roto.

Esta medida, vigente desde 2021 pero demorada por el Ayuntamiento debido a la pandemia de covid-19, busca mejorar la accesibilidad para personas invidentes y con movilidad reducida, garantizando un paso más amplio en las aceras.

Muchos propietarios reconocen que la intención es positiva, pero denuncian el impacto económico y práctico.

Esta acción se enmarca dentro del cumplimiento del real decreto ley de medidas urgentes contra el genocidio en Gaza y de apoyo a la población palestina, aprobado en septiembre de 2025, que prohíbe la publicidad de bienes y servicios procedentes de territorios ocupados. Según el ministerio, los indicios apuntan a que varias empresas israelíes podrían estar ofreciendo viajes a localidades como Jericó, en la Cisjordania palestina ocupada, aprovechando la relevancia de Fitur y la afluencia de miles de visitantes. Esta medida se suma a la iniciativa del pasado diciembre, cuando el ministerio exigió a siete multinacionales la retirada de 138 anuncios de alojamientos en asentamientos israelíes dentro del territorio palestino ocu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-consumo-abre-investigacion-sobre-viajes-a-territorios-palestinos-ocupados-presentados-en-fitur</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-consumo-abre-investigacion-sobre-viajes-a-territorios-palestinos-ocupados-presentados-en-fitur</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cómo diseñar sistemas de diálogo escalables mediante arquitecturas basadas en grafos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo reflexiona sobre los retos arquitectónicos que plantean los sistemas de diálogo en software, desde chatbots sencillos hasta videojuegos complejos, y defiende la necesidad de diseñarlos pensando en su crecimiento futuro. El autor parte de una idea clave: los requisitos rara vez permanecen estables, y la diferencia entre un sistema sostenible y una pesadilla técnica está en anticipar cómo y por dónde va a evolucionar.

Tradicionalmente, los diálogos se modelan como árboles de decisión, una estructura válida para casos triviales pero que se vuelve rígida y difícil de mantener cuando la complejidad aumenta. Frente a este enfoque, el texto propone entender el diálogo como un grafo dirigido y débilmente conexo, lo que permite reutilizar fragmentos, retroceder, introducir nuevas rutas y crecer de forma orgánica sin reescribir todo el sistema.

Este cambio conceptual abre la puerta a una validación estructural del diálogo: antes de desplegarlo, es posible comprobar automáticamente ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-disenar-sistemas-de-dialogo-escalables-mediante-arquitecturas-basadas-en-grafos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-disenar-sistemas-de-dialogo-escalables-mediante-arquitecturas-basadas-en-grafos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El desafío científico de entender la conciencia humana]]></title><description><![CDATA[La conciencia sigue siendo uno de los grandes enigmas de la ciencia. Aunque los seres vivos empezaron a desarrollar sistemas nerviosos complejos hace cientos de millones de años, aún no se sabe cómo surge la experiencia subjetiva. La neurociencia ha avanzado en identificar correlatos neuronales de la conciencia, como redes cerebrales cuya actividad refleja estados conscientes o inconscientes, y herramientas como la estimulación magnética transcraneal (TMS) combinada con electroencefalografía (EEG) permiten medir la complejidad cerebral asociada a la conciencia. Sin embargo, estas técnicas solo describen cómo el cerebro alcanza la conciencia, no por qué se siente de determinada manera. Existen múltiples teorías para explicar este fenómeno: la teoría del espacio de trabajo neuronal global (GNWT), que ve la conciencia como un escenario donde la información se proyecta y se integra; las teorías de orden superior, que dependen de representaciones meta-cognitivas; las teorías de reentrada y ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-desafio-cientifico-de-entender-la-conciencia-humana</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Víctimas de residencias critican la propuesta de Ayuso de un funeral en Madrid por el accidente de Adamuz como un intento de protagonismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de la Comunidad de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha anunciado su intención de organizar una misa funeral en la catedral de La Almudena por las víctimas del grave accidente ferroviario ocurrido en Adamuz (Córdoba) el 18 de enero de 2026, donde un tren Iryo descarriló e invadió la vía contraria, colisionando con un Alvia de Renfe y dejando 45 fallecidos y más de un centenar de heridos. Este anuncio llega tras días de silencio político por parte de Ayuso, rompiendo la unidad mostrada inicialmente entre administraciones. El funeral oficial de Estado se celebrará en Huelva el 31 de enero, dado que la mayoría de víctimas eran andaluzas, especialmente de esa provincia. La propuesta de Ayuso ha generado polémica por su carácter religioso (cuando los funerales de Estado suelen ser laicos) y por realizarse en Madrid, lejos del lugar del suceso.

Esta oferta premium promete mayor confort, serenidad y servicios personalizados (acceso a salones, cambios sin coste, espacio dedicado para trabajar o descansar), pero incluye una restricción: el espacio tranquilo está reservado a viajeros a partir de 12 años, por lo que no se pueden reservar plazas allí para niños menores de esa edad. La medida afecta solo a un porcentaje reducido de plazas (alrededor del 8% entre semana), y la SNCF defiende que responde a demandas de clientes que buscan tranquilidad, recordando que ya existía una limitación similar en la oferta anterior sin apenas críticas.

El personaje encarna una concepción nómada de la vida, tanto en lo geográfico como en lo ideológico, y funciona como un alter ego idealizado de su autor. A lo largo de los trece álbumes publicados entre 1967 y 1988, Pratt construyó un universo marcado por el viaje constante, la falta de arraigo y una profunda melancolía que se expresa tanto en los silencios como en su característico blanco y negro de trazo impresionista.

La biografía de Pratt resulta clave para entender la obra. Hijo de un funcionario destinado en la Etiopía colonial, pasó su infancia entre Venecia, África y más tarde Argentina, donde su contacto con Héctor Germán Oesterheld fue decisivo para su madurez artística. De esa etapa surgieron trabajos fundamentales como Ernie Pike o Sargento Kirk, que asentaron una forma de narrar basada en la sugerencia, el ritmo pausado y la primacía ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/corto-maltes-el-legado-nomada-y-autobiografico-de-hugo-pratt-en-la-historia-del-comic</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Filtración masiva de datos personales de 47 políticos autonómicos de 15 comunidades, incluyendo varios presidentes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un atacante conocido como 'Eurogosth' ha publicado en un portal especializado en doxxing datos personales de 47 políticos de alto nivel pertenecientes a 15 comunidades autónomas españolas.

A diferencia de muchos materiales etiquetados como biodegradables o compostables, que solo se degradan en condiciones industriales muy concretas, este plástico se comporta como uno convencional durante su uso cotidiano y se descompone cuando entra en contacto con el agua de mar.

El material está formado por componentes iónicos sencillos que se autoensamblan en una red tridimensional resistente mediante enlaces conocidos como puentes salinos. En presencia de sal marina, estos enlaces se rompen porque los iones compiten entre sí, provocando que el plástico se disuelva en cuestión de horas en moléculas que pueden ser metabolizadas por bacterias.

El proyecto contempla una transformación radical del territorio con torres residenciales y hoteles de lujo en primera línea de playa, un gran puerto en el Mediterráneo, un aeropuerto en la frontera con Egipto y nuevas ciudades que se desarrollarían por fases, empezando por el sur (como Rafah y Khan Yunis) y avanzando hacia el norte hasta la Ciudad de Gaza. Se inspira en modelos como Dubái o zonas vacacionales de Florida, promoviendo una economía basada en el libre mercado y atrayendo inversión privada. Trump defendió la idea destacando la 'ubicación espectacular' junto al mar y prometió una reconstrucción 'cuidadosamente diseñada' con respaldo internacional.

Tras comentarios sobre una posible anexión de Canadá y la imposición de aranceles, los canadienses lanzaron una campaña bajo el lema 'codos arriba', que provocó caídas significativas en las importaciones de bebidas alcohólicas estadounidenses (hasta un 60% en bourbon y whisky), zumo de naranja de Florida y una reducción notable en viajes a EE.UU., con impactos económicos millonarios para el país vecino.

En paralelo, Europa enfrenta una situación similar tras el anuncio de Trump de aranceles del 10-25% a varios países europeos (incluyendo Dinamarca, Suecia, Noruega, Francia, Alemania, Países Bajos, Finlandia y Reino Unido) por oponerse a la anexión de Groenlandia a partir de febrero de 2026.

La víctima sufrió una pérdida del 84% de visión en el ojo izquierdo debido a una rotura coroidea y una hemorragia subretiniana, según los informes médicos. La agresión comenzó dentro de la discoteca por un conflicto verbal que involucraba a uno de los amigos de la víctima y continuó en el exterior, donde el joven fue rodeado y golpeado con puñetazos y patadas por varios miembros del grupo agresor. Las cámaras de seguridad permitieron reconstruir los hechos y confirmar que hubo una actuación coordinada entre los agresores.

Estas acciones han sido criticadas por organizaciones como el Movimiento Boicot, Desinversiones y Sanciones a Israel (BDS), que denuncian la utilización del turismo como herramienta de propaganda para mejorar la imagen del Estado israelí mientras persiste la ocupación ilegal según resoluciones de la ONU. A pesar de estas denuncias y de las demandas de colectivos sociales y parlamentarios, Ifema mantiene la participación de Israel, recordando que este país ha estado presente en todas las ediciones de Fitur desde 1981.

El gobierno estadounidense justifica esta decisión citando deficiencias de la OMS en la gestión de crisis sanitarias y la influencia política de otros estados miembros, especialmente China. Washington aportaba hasta el 25% del presupuesto de la agencia y consideraba que otros países, como China, no pagaban cuotas equivalentes, generando un trato que consideran injusto. Además, destacan que la OMS nunca tuvo un director general estadounidense y que el organismo no asumió responsabilidad por fallos pasados. La administración Trump ha confirmado que no abonará los compromisos correspondientes al periodo 2024-2025, que ascienden a entre 260 y 280 millones de dólares.

Esta ley exige prueba documental de ciudadanía (como certificado de nacimiento o pasaporte) para registrarse o actualizar el voto en elecciones federales, lo que podría afectar a unos 69 millones de mujeres estadounidenses que cambiaron su apellido al casarse, ya que sus certificados de nacimiento no coinciden con sus documentos actuales. El autor predice que los republicanos aprobarán la norma en el Senado a última hora antes de las midterm de 2026, generando una crisis de documentación masiva cuando ya no sea posible corregir discrepancias a tiempo.

A nivel global, el grupo francés vendió 1.628.030 vehículos, sumando turismos y vehículos comerciales ligeros, lo que supone un crecimiento del 3,2 % respecto a 2024. El mayor impulso provino de los turismos, con 1.292.000 unidades matriculadas y un aumento del 10 %, encadenando así tres años consecutivos de crecimiento.

Europa ha sido el principal motor de estos resultados. En el continente, Renault alcanzó el segundo puesto entre los fabricantes, con 1.004.000 vehículos vendidos. Las ventas de turismos crecieron un 7,4 %, muy por encima del crecimiento medio del mercado europeo, situado en el 2,3 %, lo que permitió a la marca alcanzar una cuota del 5,7 %.

El ministro colombiano de Minas y Energía, Edwin Palma, defendió la suspensión como una decisión política orientada a proteger la soberanía energética y la dignidad nacional, subrayando que no se trata de una acción contra el pueblo ecuatoriano. Colombia recuerda que, incluso durante periodos de sequía y crisis energética, ha mantenido el suministro eléctrico a Ecuador, que en el último año obtuvo de Colombia cerca del 8% de la energía que importó.

En solo dos meses y medio, la lista de espera pasó de 2.100 pacientes a 15 de octubre a tan solo 222 el 31 de diciembre de 2025, lo que supone una reducción del 90 %. La demora media también bajó de más de un año a 37 días. DORIA realiza más de 20 pruebas oftalmológicas en 6-8 minutos, mide más de 100 parámetros y genera un informe detallado con imágenes y valoraciones que el oftalmólogo revisa y valida posteriormente. No requiere dilatar la pupila, mejora el confort del paciente y permite cribar patologías leves (el 41,6 % de los casos se resolvieron sin necesidad de atención adicional, principalmente defectos de refracción).

Estas afirmaciones se produjeron en el contexto de sus dudas sobre la lealtad de la alianza atlántica, asegurando que Estados Unidos 'nunca ha necesitado' a la OTAN y que los aliados europeos no han respondido adecuadamente cuando se les ha requerido ayuda.

Políticos británicos de distintos partidos reaccionaron con dureza. La diputada laborista Emily Thornberry, presidenta del comité de asuntos exteriores, lo calificó de 'insulto absoluto' a los 457 militares británicos fallecidos en el conflicto, destacando que el Reino Unido siempre ha respondido a las peticiones estadounidenses.

Defendió que Europa debe fortalecerse internamente, invertir mejor y de forma unida en defensa y seguridad, y mostrarse como un bloque sólido ante cualquier amenaza o coacción.

Al recriminar a un grupo de jóvenes por su comportamiento incívico, que incluía romper botellas y causar molestias, fue rodeado y agredido físicamente con patadas, puñetazos y el uso de cinturones. A pesar de la agresión, la víctima logró huir, aunque se percató de que le habían sustraído el teléfono móvil. Gracias a la rápida actuación de varias patrullas de Seguridad Ciudadana, se localizaron y detuvieron a los presuntos agresores.

Durante el dispositivo policial, Vázquez Patiño ofreció una resistencia especialmente peligrosa.

El uso de esta imagen ha provocado numerosas críticas entre usuarios y comentaristas, que consideran inapropiado recurrir a una ilustración artificial cuando existen fotografías reales del accidente. Varios comentarios destacados subrayan que una cosa es emplear infografías para explicar aspectos técnicos o perspectivas imposibles de captar con una cámara —como vistas cenitales o esquemas— y otra muy distinta es sustituir imágenes reales por recreaciones que pueden inducir a error.

Gracias a ejemplares capturados antes del colapso y trasladados a cautiverio (principalmente descendientes de aves llevadas a EE.UU. en 1925), la especie sobrevive exclusivamente en programas de cría coordinados por zoológicos de Europa y Norteamérica. Actualmente, hay alrededor de 200 individuos en estas instalaciones, que actúan como una población de seguridad para preservar la diversidad genética y evitar la endogamia. En 2025, el Zoológico de Chester (Reino Unido) logró un hito importante con el nacimiento de ocho polluelos sanos de dos parejas reproductoras, lo que refuerza la base genética, mejora la capacidad reproductiva y aumenta las posibilidades de futuro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nacen-ocho-polluelos-de-paloma-de-socorro-en-el-zoologico-de-chester-un-avance-clave-para-la-especie-extinta-en-libertad-desde-1972</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nacen-ocho-polluelos-de-paloma-de-socorro-en-el-zoologico-de-chester-un-avance-clave-para-la-especie-extinta-en-libertad-desde-1972</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump critica a España en Davos por no aumentar el gasto en defensa al 5% del PIB y el Gobierno defiende su compromiso con la OTAN]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante su intervención en el Foro Económico Mundial de Davos (Suiza) el 22 de enero de 2026, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, presentó la llamada 'Junta de Paz', un nuevo organismo internacional que busca resolver conflictos al margen de la ONU.

Acusó al país de querer 'aprovecharse' y advirtió: 'Vamos a tener que hablar con España'. Esta no es la primera vez que Trump presiona al Gobierno español por esta cuestión, ya que Pedro Sánchez ha rechazado en reiteradas ocasiones subir el gasto militar a esa cifra, argumentando que supondría recortes en servicios públicos y el Estado de bienestar.

Según los científicos, el magma sigue una 'memoria' que permanece estable mientras se encuentra estancado; cuando se produce un cambio en esa sismicidad, la erupción es inminente. Este sistema no solo avisa del inicio de la erupción, sino que también puede identificar cuándo el volcán comienza a perder fuerza, facilitando la planificación del retorno de la población evacuada y la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas.

De este modo se evitan los trayectos terrestres más peligrosos, plagados de minas, artillería, barro y detección enemiga, que causan numerosas bajas.

Esta innovación, descrita por mandos ucranianos y confirmada por la empresa Ark Robotics (que suministra robots a más de 20 brigadas), ha sorprendido incluso a sus propios fabricantes. El CEO de Ark, bajo seudónimo por seguridad, reconoció que la idea es simple pero extremadamente lógica: los drones aéreos superan con rapidez zonas de alto riesgo, mientras que los robots terrestres destacan una vez desplegados, ya que pueden infiltrarse en trinche]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ucrania-utiliza-drones-aereos-para-transportar-y-desplegar-robots-terrestres-de-combate-cerca-del-frente</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ucrania-utiliza-drones-aereos-para-transportar-y-desplegar-robots-terrestres-de-combate-cerca-del-frente</guid><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno español propone acabar con el anonimato en redes sociales para reforzar la responsabilidad online]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro de España ha expresado su intención de eliminar las cuentas anónimas en las redes sociales, argumentando que esta medida contribuiría a reducir el acoso, las amenazas y la difusión de desinformación en línea. Según su propuesta, todas las plataformas deberían implementar mecanismos de verificación de identidad que vinculen las cuentas a personas reales, con el objetivo de aumentar la responsabilidad de los usuarios. La iniciativa ha generado un debate intenso sobre privacidad, libertad de expresión y seguridad digital. Mientras algunos apoyan la medida por considerar que podría disminuir los comportamientos abusivos y proteger a víctimas de ciberacoso, otros critican que podría limitar el anonimato necesario para denunciar injusticias o proteger la identidad de activistas y periodistas.

A través del personaje de Enrique, elevado a héroe por una sociedad hedonista y decadente, la obra retrata el ascenso y la caída de unos valores colectivos basados en la competición, la idolatría y la obediencia acrítica. El deporte aparece simbolizado como una “cucaña” que promete éxito y gloria, pero que acaba revelando el vacío moral y humano que sostiene ese ideal.

La reseña subraya el carácter despiadado de la crítica social que recorre toda la pieza. García Calvo ridiculiza las pasiones de un pueblo entendido como masa, capaz de emocionarse con gestas deportivas mientras acepta sin cuestionamiento una estructura social grotesca, estatista y deshumanizada. En este contexto destaca la figura del “Padredelpueblo”, un personaje esperpéntico que encarna el adoctr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pasion-la-farsa-tragica-de-agustin-garcia-calvo-como-critica-radical-a-la-sociedad-contemporanea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pasion-la-farsa-tragica-de-agustin-garcia-calvo-como-critica-radical-a-la-sociedad-contemporanea</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Víctima de Jeffrey Epstein denuncia ante tribunal la demora del Departamento de Justicia en publicar los archivos completos del caso]]></title><description><![CDATA[Una de las sobrevivientes de la red de explotación sexual de Jeffrey Epstein, Haley Robson, ha enviado una carta a un tribunal del distrito sureste de Nueva York en la que critica duramente al Departamento de Justicia de Estados Unidos por no haber publicado de forma íntegra los archivos relacionados con el caso, tal como obliga la ley aprobada por el Congreso y firmada por el presidente Donald Trump a finales de 2025 (Epstein Files Transparency Act). En la misiva, Robson califica esta omisión como un «secretismo» que no es solo un problema burocrático, sino algo profundamente personal para las víctimas, ya que perpetúa el mismo encubrimiento que permitió que los abusos continuaran durante años sin ser controlados.

Estas herramientas permiten escanear códigos de barras o fotos de productos para determinar su país de origen, alertando si son fabricados en Estados Unidos y sugiriendo alternativas locales o europeas.

El fenómeno responde directamente a las repetidas declaraciones del presidente Donald Trump sobre la posible adquisición o mayor control estadounidense de Groenlandia, territorio autónomo bajo soberanía danesa.

La acusación principal es que el banco canceló unilateralmente varias cuentas bancarias de Trump por motivos políticos, tras el asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, cuando Trump alentó a sus seguidores a impedir la certificación de la victoria electoral de Joe Biden. La demanda, interpuesta en un tribunal estatal del condado de Miami-Dade (Florida), alega violación de los códigos éticos del banco, difamación comercial, incumplimiento del pacto de buena fe y trato justo, así como infracción de la Ley de Prácticas Comerciales Desleales y Engañosas de Florida.

En concreto, criticó la encuesta conjunta del New York Times y el Siena College Research Institute, afirmando que estaba inclinada a favor de los demócratas y anunciando acciones legales para exigir que se conserven los registros internos de la encuesta.

Durante su visita a Washington y reuniones con legisladores estadounidenses, Machado defendió que la liberación de Venezuela era solo el primer paso hacia la eliminación del comunismo y la dictadura en América Latina. Sus comentarios provocaron críticas inmediatas en redes sociales, donde muchos usuarios la calificaron de hipócrita y cuestionaron su idoneidad para recibir el Nobel de la Paz.

En una entrevista con el editor jefe de Bloomberg News, Milei subrayó que el peso de China en la economía global hace inevitable el comercio con Pekín, incluso mientras su Gobierno busca avanzar hacia un acuerdo de libre comercio con Washington.

Las declaraciones se produjeron minutos después de que Milei participara en un evento junto al presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, reforzando la imagen de equilibrio que intenta proyectar entre ambas potencias.

El acto tuvo lugar en el Kennedy Center durante una fiesta organizada por Republicans for National Renewal, un grupo de derecha que promueve la posibilidad de que Donald Trump aspire a un tercer mandato presidencial, algo que actualmente sería inconstitucional. El pastel fue presentado de forma irónica como el “estado número 51”, en clara alusión a la reiterada propuesta de Trump de adquirir la isla ártica.

Al encuentro asistieron varios legisladores republicanos, entre ellos Anna Paulina Luna, Abe Hamadeh y Andy Ogles. Luna fue quien cortó la primera porción del pastel, mientras algunos asistentes advertían en tono jocoso de que el gesto podía provocar un escándalo internacional.

El autor descarta excusas indulgentes y apunta a una ejecución deficiente de la soldadura o problemas en el proceso de laminado del raíl. Sin embargo, enfatiza que este incidente no es aislado, sino que revela un problema más profundo y estructural en la red de alta velocidad española. Las vías, diseñadas originalmente para cargas y tráfico menores, están soportando actualmente un volumen muy superior al previsto, agravado por trenes pesados como el Frecciarossa (modelo ETR 1000 operado por Iryo), que contribuyen a un desgaste acelerado.

Según cuatro fuentes citadas por The Guardian, estas negociaciones comenzaron en otoño de 2025, tras una conversación entre Trump y Maduro en noviembre, en la que el presidente estadounidense exigió la salida de Maduro, que fue rechazada.

Durante la entrevista, Roma repasó algunos de los hitos más importantes de su carrera deportiva, entre ellos el haber ganado el Rally Dakar tanto en motos como en coches, un logro reservado a muy pocos. Sin embargo, el momento más emotivo de su intervención llegó cuando habló de su experiencia personal con la enfermedad.

En 2022, a Nani Roma le diagnosticaron un cáncer de vejiga, del que consiguió recuperarse tras un duro proceso médico que culminó con éxito en 2023, permitiéndole incluso volver a la competición profesional. A raíz de esta vivencia, el piloto quiso expresar públicamente su agradecimiento a los profesionales sanitarios que le atendieron durante su tratamiento.

La advertencia se produjo durante una entrevista en Fox Business en el Foro Económico Mundial en Davos. Trump afirmó que 'tenemos todas las cartas', aunque no especificó qué medidas concretas podrían adoptarse. La especulación surgió tras la planificación de un aumento de aranceles a productos de ocho países europeos, lo que podría haber llevado a Europa a vender billones en bonos y acciones estadounidenses. Esto podría afectar a los mercados financieros, ya tensionados por las intenciones de Trump sobre la isla ártica. El acuerdo marco que evitó la escalada incluye la promesa estadounidense de no imponer nuevos aranceles, la instalación de misiles en el territorio danés semi-autónomo y la regulación de derechos minerales para limitar la influencia china, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-sobre-posibles-represalias-si-europa-vende-activos-de-eeuu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-advierte-sobre-posibles-represalias-si-europa-vende-activos-de-eeuu</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Siete hombres condenados a 97 años por violar a una joven en Zaragoza durante dos días]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Audiencia Provincial de Zaragoza ha condenado a siete hombres a un total de 97 años de prisión por la agresión sexual continuada de una joven durante dos días en junio de 2020 en un piso del barrio de San José. Los acusados estaban vinculados a la banda juvenil Dominican's Don’t Play. Según la sentencia, la víctima fue llevada al piso tras pasar la tarde bebiendo alcohol y consumiendo marihuana, donde se le obligó a mantener relaciones sexuales mientras se encontraba en estado de confusión y aturdimiento. Para justificar estas agresiones, los condenados alegaron un supuesto ritual de curación para “sacar el demonio” que la joven llevaba dentro. Varios de los actos fueron grabados con el móvil de uno de los agresores y descubiertos por la Policía Nacional durante la desarticulación de la banda en 2021. Los vídeos mostraban a la víctima quejándose y exhausta, mientras los agresores se reían de ella.

Teo Moreno, coordinador de comunicación de SEMAF, ha explicado que los profesionales reportan incidencias diarias por vibraciones en las vías, pero hasta ahora no se imponían límites de velocidad para no afectar la operativa de la alta velocidad, considerada la 'joya de la corona'. Afirma que fuera de España no se entiende que un aviso por vibraciones no conlleve restricciones inmediatas, y que estas vibraciones aceleran el desgaste de vías y trenes, creando un ciclo vicioso que puede llevar al colapso de materiales.

El club mantuvo una línea de defensa de la libertad de expresión y del derecho a un referéndum pactado, sin apoyar explícitamente la independencia. Comunicados oficiales, declaraciones de dirigentes y jugadores, y decisiones como la presencia en actos de la Diada o el Concert per la Llibertat muestran una estrategia clara basada en valores democráticos y diálogo.

El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea (TJUE) condenó a España por incumplir la Directiva de aguas residuales urbanas, señalando 12 puntos críticos en Tenerife de un total de 29 a nivel nacional, con deficiencias en colectores, tratamiento y control. Aunque la sentencia de diciembre de 2025 no impone sanción inmediata, abre la posibilidad de multas si no se corrigen los problemas de forma urgente. Datos del Gobierno de Canarias de 2025 registran 403 puntos de vertidos, más del 50% sin autorización, concentrándose principalmente en Tenerife. Algunos episodios recientes, como el cierre casi un año de Playa Jardín por altos niveles de E. coli, reflejan la magnitud del problema.

El banco se pregunta si este gasto masivo llegará a compensarse con beneficios reales en productividad y rentabilidad.

El informe destaca que la euforia actual en torno a la IA está impulsando subidas en bolsa de empresas como Nvidia y otras del S&P 500, pero estas alzas ya incorporan expectativas muy optimistas de aumento de productividad (lo que implicaría automatización, despidos y reducción de costes laborales).

Hubo un 47 % más de vendedores que de compradores activos, lo que equivale a aproximadamente 631.000 vendedores adicionales sin demanda suficiente. El número de compradores activos cayó hasta un mínimo histórico de 1,34 millones, el nivel más bajo desde abril de 2020, al inicio de la pandemia.

Este cambio drástico se debe a varios factores: los precios de las viviendas siguen siendo muy elevados, las tasas hipotecarias continúan altas (alrededor del 6 %), despidos laborales, e incertidumbre económica y política. Esto contrasta con el mercado de 2021, cuando los compradores superaban ampliamente a los vendedores y se producían guerras de ofertas. El mercado se equilibró en febrero de 2024, pero desde entonces los vendedores han dominado claramente.

Explica que históricamente EE.UU. ha sido el garante de la seguridad para el libre comercio mundial, a cambio de que otros países invirtieran en su economía. Esto ha beneficiado a Washington, pero también ha creado una dependencia: la economía estadounidense necesita compradores exteriores para sostenerse.

Ambos ministros, cuyo pasado está vinculado al dictador Augusto Pinochet, desempeñaron roles importantes como abogados durante el régimen militar. Esta decisión ha generado una gran polémica dentro del país, ya que muchos ciudadanos y partidos políticos consideran que la elección de estas personas podría agravar las tensiones sociales y políticas, especialmente en lo relacionado con la memoria histórica y los derechos humanos. En la actualidad, Kast enfrenta la presión de demostrar que su gobierno es inclusivo y respetuoso con la democracia y los derechos fundamentales. Sin embargo, estos nombramientos parecen contradecir esa postura, generando un fuerte debate en la sociedad chilena sobre cómo se deben abordar los temas relacionados con el legado de Pinochet y la justicia para las víctimas de la dictadura.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kast-designa-a-dos-antiguos-abogados-de-pinochet-en-su-gobierno-como-ministros-clave-en-defensa-y-derechos-humanos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/kast-designa-a-dos-antiguos-abogados-de-pinochet-en-su-gobierno-como-ministros-clave-en-defensa-y-derechos-humanos</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El cambio de juez obliga a aplazar sine die el juicio contra Villarejo y López Madrid por el caso Pinto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El juicio contra el excomisario José Manuel Villarejo y el empresario Javier López Madrid, acusados de acosar y agredir con arma blanca a la doctora Elisa Pinto, ha sido suspendido de nuevo y sin fecha concreta. La vista oral debía comenzar el próximo 2 de febrero, pero el cambio de titularidad en el Juzgado de lo Penal número 10 de Madrid ha hecho inviable su celebración. La jueza inicialmente designada ya no está al frente del órgano judicial y, aunque se nombre un sustituto en breve, las fuentes jurídicas descartan que pueda asumir el procedimiento a tiempo, dado el volumen y la complejidad de la causa.

La Fiscalía solicita para ambos acusados una pena conjunta de 13 años y dos meses de prisión por delitos de lesiones, coacciones, amenazas y contra la administración de justicia.

Esta medida se anunció el 21 de enero de 2026 en Estrasburgo, coincidiendo con un discurso de Trump en el Foro Económico Mundial de Davos, donde reiteró su interés en la isla por motivos de seguridad, aunque insistió en que no usaría la fuerza y pidió negociaciones inmediatas con Dinamarca.

El acuerdo previo establecía aranceles estadounidenses del 15% sobre productos europeos (frente al 30% amenazado inicialmente) a cambio de inversiones europeas en EE.UU.

Rutte también negó que estas conversaciones supongan un giro estratégico impulsado por Donald Trump, asegurando que se trataría más bien de una llamada a los países de la OTAN para incrementar su implicación en una región considerada cada vez más sensible desde el punto de vista geopolítico.

Sin mencionar directamente a Donald Trump, Carney criticó cómo las grandes potencias utilizan la integración económica como arma de coerción, aranceles y control de cadenas de suministro para imponer sus intereses, dejando a las potencias medianas en posición de debilidad si negocian por separado.

Inspirándose en un ensayo de Václav Havel sobre vivir en la mentira, Carney afirmó que ya no se debe fingir que el viejo sistema funciona y que la nostalgia no es estrategia.

En apenas dos décadas, el país ha pasado de un sistema ferroviario saturado y precario a la red de alta velocidad más extensa del mundo, con más de 50.000 kilómetros en servicio y planes para alcanzar los 70.000 en 2035, conectando todas las ciudades de más de medio millón de habitantes. Este despliegue ha transformado la movilidad interna, reducido distancias y reforzado la cohesión social entre regiones muy dispares.

El único episodio grave que puso en cuestión este modelo fue el accidente de Wenzhou en 2011, cuando un tren detenido por un fallo eléctrico fue embestido por otro en un viaducto, provocando la caída de varios vagones, 40 muertos y más de 200 heridos. El suceso supuso un duro golpe para la confianza ciudadana en el medio de transporte más utilizado del país y obligó al Gobierno a reaccionar con medidas inmediatas y excepcionales.

Tras el impacto, los navegantes del avión inferior saltaron en paracaídas por precaución, mientras que Leonard Graham Fuller, piloto del avión superior, mantuvo el control utilizando los alerones y flaps de su avión junto con la propulsión de los motores del avión inferior. Fuller logró realizar un descenso controlado de casi diez minutos y aterrizó de panza sobre un prado despejado, salvando ambos aparatos.

Sánchez tiene previsto viajar a India en febrero de 2026, coincidiendo con el 'Año Dual' entre ambos países, y planea otra visita a China durante el año.

La estrategia, aún en una fase inicial, se inspiraría en el esquema aplicado previamente contra Venezuela, donde Washington intentó presionar al entorno del poder político y militar para forzar un desenlace favorable a sus intereses sin asumir costes directos.

Trump ha endurecido en las últimas semanas su retórica contra La Habana, amenazando con cortar totalmente el suministro de petróleo y emplazando al Gobierno cubano a negociar “antes de que sea demasiado tarde”. De acuerdo con el diario neoyorquino, Estados Unidos estaría tratando de identificar a miembros de la oficialidad cubana dispuestos a colaborar en una transición política que implique el abandono del sistema comunista.

Según el texto, Rutte habría mostrado una sumisión extrema hacia Donald Trump, calificándolo de 'líder del mundo libre' y afirmando que la OTAN no puede concebirse sin él. Además, defiende las pretensiones estadounidenses sobre Groenlandia al argumentar que es necesario proteger el Ártico de la influencia de Rusia y China, lo que el artículo interpreta como una aceptación implícita del dominio sobre el territorio danés. Rutte critica a países como España, Italia o Bélgica por no alcanzar el 2% del PIB en gasto en defensa sin la presión de Trump, obviando que dicho compromiso se estableció en 2014 bajo Obama.

Según el informe European Electricity Review 2026, elaborado por el think tank británico Ember, ambas fuentes renovables alcanzaron el 30,1% de la generación eléctrica en la UE, frente al 29% procedente de carbón, gas y derivados del petróleo.

Este avance se explica principalmente por el fuerte crecimiento de la energía solar, que aumentó un 20,1% respecto a 2024, encadenando cuatro años consecutivos de incrementos similares. La solar aportó el 13,2% del total de electricidad generada en la UE, mientras que la eólica alcanzó el 16,9%. Desde 2020, la contribución conjunta de ambas tecnologías ha pasado del 19,7% al 30,1%, lo que para Ember refleja un cambio estructural en el modelo energético europeo.

La superintendenta del distrito explicó que, cuando llegó al lugar, el coche del padre seguía en marcha y agentes federales ya habían sacado al menor del vehículo.

Según el testimonio de la responsable escolar, un agente llevó al niño hasta la puerta de su casa y le indicó que llamara para comprobar si había más personas dentro, una actuación que calificó de utilización del menor como “cebo”.

Las llamas fueron detectadas alrededor de las 20:30 horas en una zona próxima a la localidad nijareña de Rodalquilar, conocida por su pasado minero ligado a las antiguas explotaciones de oro.

Desde el primer momento, el fuego movilizó un importante dispositivo del Servicio de Extinción de Incendios Forestales de Andalucía (INFOCA). En las labores de extinción participaron tres grupos de bomberos forestales, un técnico de operaciones, un agente de Medio Ambiente y dos autobombas. Las tareas se desarrollaron en condiciones complicadas, especialmente por las fuertes rachas de viento que han azotado la comarca, un factor que dificulta notablemente el control del perímetro y aumenta el riesgo de propagación.

El problema es especialmente grave en los centros de gran tamaño gestionados por la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS), donde se dan situaciones extremas como la presencia de una sola enfermera para atender a hasta 600 residentes durante turnos nocturnos.

El informe de la Cámara de Cuentas correspondiente a 2024 ha revelado que el Gobierno autonómico autorizó el traspaso de más de 61 millones de euros del presupuesto de la AMAS para financiar actividad sanitaria prestada en 2021 por la Fundación Jiménez Díaz, perteneciente al grupo privado Quirón.

Según la resolución, Ceuta y Canarias llevan meses alertando de un desbordamiento grave de sus sistemas de acogida, con una ocupación que triplica su capacidad ordinaria. Mantener a los menores en esas condiciones, señala el tribunal, sería “gravemente perjudicial” para su bienestar, por lo que frenar los traslados solo serviría para prolongar una situación ya calificada como dañina.

A partir de su libro de relatos ‘Mari contra la pobreza’, Montalbán utiliza la ficción como herramienta para visibilizar situaciones cotidianas de precariedad que suelen permanecer ocultas o normalizadas.

El autor explica que la sociedad identifica con facilidad la pobreza severa, pero tiende a ignorar la pobreza “a secas”, pese a que una parte muy significativa de la población murciana vive en riesgo de exclusión. Esta invisibilización se debe, según él, a la persistente idea de que la pobreza es culpa de quien la padece y al rechazo colectivo a asumir que sus causas son sociales y políticas. Reconocerla implicaría cuestionar el modelo económico y social existente.

En el tercer trimestre de 2025, el 1% más rico de los hogares controlaba el 31,7% de toda la riqueza del país, la mayor proporción registrada desde que existen estadísticas comparables. En términos absolutos, este grupo acumula unos 55 billones de dólares en activos, una cifra similar a la riqueza total del 90% inferior de la población estadounidense.

Los economistas advierten de que esta concentración no es un fenómeno puntual, sino una tendencia que se ha intensificado especialmente desde la pandemia. Mientras que el crecimiento del patrimonio de las clases medias y bajas se ha estancado o ralentizado, las grandes fortunas han seguido aumentando a gran velocidad. Un informe reciente de Oxfam señala que la riqueza de los multimillonarios creció en 2025 a un ritmo tres veces superior al promedio anual de los cinco años anteriores.

Inicialmente, sus operadores afirmaron que la suspensión no estaba relacionada con su reciente scraping masivo de datos de Spotify (incluyendo metadatos y canciones de las pistas más reproducidas, con un total estimado de 300 TB). Sin embargo, documentos judiciales desclasificados revelan que sí fue consecuencia directa de una demanda presentada por Spotify junto a las grandes discográficas Sony, Warner y Universal Music Group (UMG) en el Tribunal de Distrito del Sur de Nueva York.

La demanda se presentó sellada a finales de diciembre de 2025 y el 2 de enero de 2026 se concedió una orden de restricción temporal (TRO) de manera ex parte, sin notificar a Anna’s Archive para evitar que publicaran inmediatamente los archivos de audio scrapeados.

El proyecto ferroviario, clave para la conexión de Euskadi con la alta velocidad y con los corredores europeos, acumula ya 2.200 millones de euros en sobrecostes y más de 20 años de retraso respecto a los plazos inicialmente previstos.

Según el calendario original, la infraestructura debía estar en funcionamiento en 2010. Posteriormente, una revisión del plan realizada en 2020 fijó 2023 como nueva fecha objetivo. Ninguna de ellas se cumplió. En 2024, la Comisión Europea situó la posible finalización en 2030, pero el propio informe recoge que los promotores del proyecto ya apuntan a 2035 como horizonte más realista, lo que supondría un retraso superior a dos décadas.

Buffett compró unos grandes almacenes en Baltimore durante el auge de los centros comerciales y se encontró con que la competencia instalaba escaleras mecánicas para atraer clientes. Él replicó la acción, pero pronto se dio cuenta de que la inversión no aumentaba las ventas ni atraía más clientes; simplemente mantenía a los que ya tenía, generando costes innecesarios. El economista Michael Burry utiliza esta analogía para advertir que empresas como Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Palantir o Meta podrían estar repitiendo el mismo patrón con la IA: gastando grandes cantidades de dinero para mantener una ventaja percibida, pero sin un retorno real proporcional a la inversión.

Esta afirmación reavivó el debate histórico sobre el reparto de responsabilidades en defensa dentro de la OTAN, donde Trump ha criticado repetidamente el bajo gasto militar de muchos aliados europeos. En respuesta, la primera ministra italiana Giorgia Meloni intervino con dureza y sarcasmo, señalando: 'Perfecto.

Sin embargo, el artículo técnico detalla que las antenas ESA de bajo perfil de Starlink (solo 2,5-3,5 pulgadas de altura), instaladas en la zona trasera del fuselaje donde el ángulo de ataque (AoA) del avión y la capa límite reducen la exposición al viento, tendrían un impacto mucho menor, estimado en torno al 0,3%, frente al 1-2,2% de sistemas tradicionales más voluminosos.

La diferencia fiscal entre ambos productos es considerable: mientras el fuelóleo tributa a 0,56 euros por tonelada métrica, el gasóleo lo hace a 222 euros por cada mil litros.

El anuncio se produjo tras una reunión con el secretario general de la Alianza Atlántica, Mark Rutte, y fue difundido por Trump a través de su red social Truth. Según el mandatario, este entendimiento preliminar sería beneficioso tanto para Estados Unidos como para el conjunto de países aliados.

Rutte confirmó posteriormente que la descripción de Trump era correcta, aunque evitó ofrecer detalles concretos sobre el contenido del acuerdo, subrayando que las conversaciones continuarán. Como consecuencia inmediata, Trump aseguró que Estados Unidos renuncia a imponer los aranceles previstos para el 1 de febrero a ocho países aliados que habían desplegado tropas en Groenlandia en apoyo de la soberanía danesa.

Líderes demócratas como Hakeem Jeffries han calificado la intervención como una 'vergüenza' para el país, mientras que el senador Dick Durbin ha criticado la falta de humildad y verdad del presidente, advirtiendo que las amenazas y fanfarronerías de Trump están agotando la paciencia de los aliados y que Estados Unidos pagará un alto precio por su ego. Lo más destacado ha sido la aparición de disidencias dentro del Partido Republicano. El congresista Thomas Massie, conocido por su perfil libertario y sus frecuentes desencuentros con la dirección del partido, publicó un mensaje sarcástico en redes sociales dirigido a Dinamarca: 'Psst, Dinamarca… Díganle a esta administración que los archivos de Epstein están en Groenlandia… perderán todo interés y nunca podrán encontrarlos'.

Tras el abandono de unos inquilinos en 2021, Alberto, que atravesaba graves problemas de adicciones, se instaló en el piso y permitió que otras personas lo usaran, presuntamente como narcopiso. Ante esta situación, la familia de Elisa contrató a una empresa privada de desocupación para recuperar el inmueble.

El encargado de esa empresa, Richard Dantas, logró que las personas que ocupaban la vivienda se marcharan y cambió la cerradura. Sin embargo, según la versión de la familia, acabó quedándose a vivir en el piso desde 2023, pese a no existir un contrato formal de alquiler ni una compraventa cerrada. La familia sostiene que el pago del servicio se hizo sin recibos y que Dantas fue retrasando su salida con promesas incumplidas de compra del inmueble.

Esta instalación genera fuerzas de hasta 1.900 veces la gravedad terrestre (1.900 g-toneladas), superando el récord anterior establecido por su predecesora CHIEF1300 hace apenas meses y al anterior líder mundial, una centrifugadora estadounidense de 1.200 g-toneladas.

El sistema permite simular en laboratorio condiciones extremas que en la naturaleza tardarían siglos o milenios en desarrollarse, acelerando procesos físicos mediante la aplicación de hipergravedad a modelos a escala reducida. De esta forma, se 'comprime' el tiempo y el espacio experimentalmente: por ejemplo, se ha probado la estabilidad de una presa de casi 300 metros utilizando un modelo de solo tres metros sometido a unas 100 veces la gravedad terrestre, reproduciendo tensiones reales en poco tiempo.

Esta frase surgió al comentar las críticas habituales que recibe por su estilo autoritario y al destacar que su discurso recibió buenas reseñas, a diferencia de lo que suele ocurrir. El comentario se produce en un contexto de tensiones internacionales agravadas por su insistencia en adquirir Groenlandia (confundiéndola repetidamente con Islandia), amenazas de aranceles a países europeos y aliados de la OTAN que se oponen, y una retórica agresiva hacia Canadá y Europa. Como consecuencia, el Parlamento Europeo ha congelado un acuerdo comercial con Estados Unidos, fondos de pensiones daneses y suecos han empezado a deshacerse de bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, y Rusia ha expresado satisfacción por las divisiones en la OTAN.

La medida se produce después de que técnicos de la Generalitat confirmaran que el teléfono corporativo de Cuenca había sido reseteado antes de su devolución, eliminando así toda la información almacenada. La propuesta de recuperar los mensajes fue presentada por el abogado de Compromís, que ejerce acusación popular, y aceptada voluntariamente por Cuenca.

Inicialmente, la empresa negó un acceso ilegítimo a sus bases de datos y atribuyó lo ocurrido a un caso de credential stuffing, es decir, reutilización de combinaciones de correo y contraseña procedentes de filtraciones externas. Sin embargo, en el mismo comunicado reconocía que podían haberse visto expuestos datos personales como nombre, apellidos, DNI, dirección, IP, correo electrónico y teléfono.

El hacker, conocido como daghetiaw, ha rebatido públicamente esa versión asegurando que no se trató solo de accesos mediante credenciales reutilizadas, sino de una intrusión más profunda.

Desde Izquierda Unida, líderes como Antonio Maíllo y Enrique Santiago han rechazado la participación española, argumentando que la Junta está fuera del control de la ONU, carece de garantías legales internacionales y podría favorecer el despojo del pueblo palestino. También critican la implicación de Benjamin Netanyahu, quien tiene una orden de arresto de la Corte Penal Internacional desde 2024 por presuntos crímenes de guerra.

El secretario de Comercio de Estados Unidos, Howard Lutnick, intervino con un discurso muy crítico hacia la Unión Europea, cuestionando su competitividad económica y defendiendo el regreso al carbón como fuente de energía principal en detrimento de las renovables. Estas declaraciones provocaron reacciones inmediatas de incomodidad entre los asistentes de alto nivel, incluyendo abucheos generalizados, entre ellos del exvicepresidente estadounidense Al Gore. La situación escaló hasta el punto de que la presidenta del Banco Central Europeo, Christine Lagarde, se levantó de su asiento y abandonó la sala mientras Lutnick seguía hablando, dejándolo con la palabra en la boca.

Según Powell, el rey emérito ejerció una influencia directa y pragmática en momentos clave, amparado por un amplio consenso político interno y por una relación fluida con los presidentes del Gobierno, especialmente con los de izquierdas.

Uno de los aspectos más relevantes abordados es la cuestión de Gibraltar. Powell sostiene que, en conversaciones privadas con responsables británicos a comienzos de los años ochenta, Juan Carlos I llegó a admitir que el objetivo real de España no era recuperar el Peñón, sino garantizar el ingreso en la Comunidad Económica Europea.

Solé Sabaté, titulado 'La Cerdanya republicana i antifranquista, Joan Solé Cristòfol'. El texto denuncia el carácter apologético y poco riguroso de la obra, que presenta una biografía elogiosa del alcalde de Bellver durante la Guerra Civil, Joan Solé Cristòfol, omitiendo evidencias documentales que cuestionan la versión oficial de los 'Hechos de Bellver' del 27 de abril de 1937. Según el autor de la recensión, estos hechos no fueron un combate defensivo contra un asalto anarquista liderado por Antonio Martín Escudero ('El Cojo de Málaga'), sino una emboscada y asesinato premeditado en el que participó el hermano del alcalde, Emili Solé, con implicación de milicianos del PSUC, ERC y otros grupos.

Tras el acto, el portavoz del Gobierno madrileño, Miguel Ángel García, ha comparecido y ha vinculado estos sucesos a lo que describe como una gestión 'caótica' del Ministerio de Transportes bajo el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. Aunque ha pedido prudencia y respeto a las víctimas mientras avanza la investigación —que aún genera más dudas que certezas—, García ha criticado duramente al ministerio, señalando que dos de sus máximos dirigentes están en una situación complicada: uno en prisión y otro más centrado en redes sociales que en su labor.

Ante esta situación, el colectivo Bulegoak Borrokan / Oficinas en Lucha ha lanzado una campaña que propone reducir la jornada laboral en la misma proporción que se ha perdido en salario, hasta que se recupere un convenio justo. El objetivo de la iniciativa es generar debate, concienciar sobre la precariedad laboral y fomentar la organización colectiva para presionar a la patronal y reactivar la negociación de un convenio actualizado. La campaña ya ha conseguido 2.385 firmantes de 581 empresas de Bizkaia, reflejando el descontento creciente del sector.

Además, Eilish criticó la falta de políticas efectivas para combatir la crisis climática y la dependencia de combustibles fósiles y ganadería que afectan la salud y el medio ambiente.

Sin embargo, un manifiesto firmado por un centenar de asociaciones científicas, plataformas ciudadanas y sindicatos denuncia que esta medida rompe la continuidad asistencial, genera multiconsultas, duplicación de pruebas diagnósticas y riesgos de iatrogenia.

Según ha explicado, estas marcas presentan un espesor aproximado de un milímetro y una anchura de varios centímetros, y se repiten de forma similar en los primeros vagones del Iryo, lo que apunta a un posible elemento externo que habría ido dañando progresivamente los bogies delanteros.

Puente ha señalado que Renfe y Adif han revisado trenes que pasaron por la zona en distintos momentos. En los que circularon con una diferencia superior a una hora respecto al Iryo no se han detectado marcas, mientras que en dos o tres trenes anteriores sí se han observado muescas similares, aunque con diferencias, como su aparición solo en uno de los lados del tren.

Esta propuesta surge como alternativa a la compra inicialmente prevista de 88 cazas F-35 estadounidenses, de los cuales solo 16 seguirían adelante al haberse iniciado ya los pagos.

El debate se produce en un clima marcado por los aranceles impulsados por el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump y sus declaraciones sobre una hipotética anexión de Canadá, lo que ha incrementado el recelo de la opinión pública canadiense hacia su vecino del sur.

El Patronato sobrevivió al fin de la dictadura y continuó operativo hasta 1985, ya en democracia, con financiación estatal y métodos prácticamente idénticos: reclusión, trabajo forzado para empresas, adoctrinamiento religioso intenso, silencio impuesto, control de correspondencia y malas condiciones de vida con frío y hambre.

Según las hipótesis que manejan los investigadores, este defecto no habría sido una rotura súbita ni un fallo puntual, sino un problema localizado en un punto sensible de la vía, posiblemente en una soldadura o en el entorno de un cambio de agujas próximo a una estación técnica.

En su escrito, señala directamente a altos cargos de Adif y de la Agencia Estatal de Seguridad Ferroviaria (AESF), a quienes atribuye posibles delitos de homicidio y lesiones por imprudencia grave, así como infracciones contra los derechos de los trabajadores.

Esta estructura irregular habría servido para financiar ilegalmente las campañas electorales autonómicas de 2007 y 2011, así como las generales de 2008.

El magistrado argumenta que, más allá de la prescripción de los delitos electorales (los de 2007 y 2008 ya prescritos al citarlos como investigados, y los de 2011 prescritos para quienes no lo fueran antes del 24 de septiembre de 2016), no existen indicios suficientes que demuestren que Aguirre tuviera conocimiento o participación en los hechos delictivos.

Según este organismo, se trata de la tormenta geomagnética más potente registrada en los últimos 20 años, lo que explica su amplio impacto visual más allá de las regiones polares.

Las tormentas solares se producen cuando el Sol emite grandes cantidades de partículas cargadas, principalmente electrones y protones, que viajan por el espacio e interactúan con el campo magnético terrestre. Al llegar a la Tierra, la magnetosfera actúa como un escudo que canaliza estas partículas hacia las zonas cercanas a los polos. Allí, al chocar con los gases de la atmósfera en la exosfera, se genera la emisión de luz que conocemos como auroras boreales.

La intensidad excepcional de esta tormenta ha permiti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-tormenta-solar-historica-permite-observar-auroras-boreales-en-gran-parte-de-europa-incluida-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-tormenta-solar-historica-permite-observar-auroras-boreales-en-gran-parte-de-europa-incluida-espana</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 15:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mark Carney critica en Davos el apaciguamiento ante Trump y aboga por autonomía estratégica europea mediante coaliciones]]></title><description><![CDATA[En el Foro Económico Mundial de Davos, el primer ministro de Canadá, Mark Carney, pronunció un discurso destacado contra la deriva imperialista y el trumpismo, inspirándose en Václav Havel para defender la honestidad como base de la resistencia al abuso de poder.

Su intervención recibió una ovación prolongada. Previamente, Ursula von der Leyen urgió a acelerar la independencia europea de Estados Unidos, prometiendo una respuesta firme, unida y proporcional a las amenazas de Trump, y abogó por avances en el mercado único, unión de capitales, energía, defensa y apoyo a Ucrania, además de seguridad en el Ártico ante la crisis por Groenlandia.

Herrera Lobato, propietario de una gestoría y con un amplio entramado de sociedades mercantiles a su nombre, deberá comparecer ante la Audiencia Nacional.

Su nombre proviene de la unión de 'velocipede' (bicicleta en francés) y 'dog' (perro en inglés), ya que fueron diseñados originalmente para defender a los ciclistas de los frecuentes ataques de perros, que provocaban numerosos accidentes en esa época. Estas armas se fabricaron en grandes cantidades en toda Europa hasta el comienzo de la Primera Guerra Mundial, aproximadamente entre 1880 y 1920. Inicialmente usaban un cartucho especial de 6 mm Velo-Dog, cargado con proyectiles de pimienta para ahuyentar o de plomo para mayor efectividad. Con el tiempo, ganaron popularidad como armas de defensa personal y se produjeron en calibres más comunes como 6,35 mm y 7,65 mm.

En declaraciones contundentes a la prensa, instó a los líderes europeos a abandonar las sutilezas diplomáticas y a 'desarrollar una columna vertebral', 'contraatacar muy agresivamente' y 'combatir el fuego con fuego' en lugar de intentar apaciguar al mandatario estadounidense. Describió a Trump como 'débil', afirmando que explota las debilidades ajenas pero retrocede ante una respuesta firme, y llegó a decir que retrocede 'cuando le dan un puñetazo en la cara'.

A finales de 2025, las autoridades israelíes colocaron un aviso declarando ilegal la instalación y emitieron posteriormente una orden de demolición, alegando que fue levantada sin los permisos necesarios.

El terreno se encuentra en un área clasificada como Zona C según los Acuerdos de Oslo, lo que implica control civil y militar israelí, a pesar de que el muro de separación lo deja físicamente del lado palestino de Belén.

Tradicionalmente, tipos más altos fortalecían la moneda al atraer capital, pero ahora los inversores interpretan estas subidas como señal de estrés fiscal en un país con deuda pública cercana al 230 % del PIB, penalizando el riesgo soberano en lugar de premiar la rentabilidad.

Este fenómeno se acelera con la política de la primera ministra Sanae Takaichi, quien asumió en octubre de 2025 y enfrenta elecciones anticipadas.

En Zúrich, miles de personas se concentraron para expresar su rechazo al presidente estadounidense, quemando banderas de Estados Unidos y portando pancartas con mensajes como «Put the Trumpster in the dumpster». La protesta derivó en enfrentamientos con la policía, que utilizó cañones de agua, gases irritantes y balas de goma tras recibir lanzamiento de piedras y petardos, aunque no se reportaron heridos. Además, activistas proyectaron una caricatura de Trump en una pista de esquí con la leyenda «Spirit of plutocracy».

El malestar se centra en las reiteradas amenazas de Trump de tomar el control de Groenlandia por motivos de seguridad nacional, sin descartar acciones militares, y sus advertencias de imponer aranceles a países que comercien con el territorio danés.

La práctica se llevaba a cabo ya en el hospital público gestionado por la misma compañía en Elche, donde cada catéter podía usarse hasta diez veces tras una esterilización realizada dentro del hospital, algo prohibido por la normativa española y europea. Expertos sanitarios advierten del riesgo de infección y del deterioro de las propiedades del catéter al emplearlo más de una vez. La directiva que envió el correo justificaba la medida por el ahorro económico, comparando el gasto de Torrejón con el de Vinalopó y señalando un ahorro potencial de más de 160.000 euros.

El siniestro, el primero mortal en la alta velocidad española, involucró un tren Iryo (Málaga-Madrid) que descarriló, provocando la colisión con un Alvia (Madrid-Huelva) en vía contraria y resultando en más de 40 fallecidos y numerosos heridos. Técnicos de mantenimiento de Adif, desplazados horas después del suceso, detectaron varias traviesas de hormigón completamente destrozadas a unos 100 metros del punto de descarrilamiento, lo que sugiere el impacto fuerte de un elemento contundente desprendido del tren antes del accidente. Además, se halló un trozo de carril partido de unos 30 cm cerca de la aguja de cambio de vía. El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, ha insistido en determinar si esta rotura fue causa o consecuencia del descarrilamiento.

El caso ha cobrado relevancia pública en un contexto de protestas contra el despliegue de agentes de ICE en distintos estados del país y de creciente escrutinio sobre las prácticas de detención de inmigrantes.

Courvelle, de 56 años, trabajaba como agente de detención en una instalación gestionada por Geo Group Inc., una empresa privada contratada por ICE para operar centros de internamiento. Según los documentos judiciales, el abuso tuvo lugar a lo largo de varios encuentros mientras la víctima permanecía detenida, una situación que la ley estadounidense considera especialmente grave por la relación de poder y la imposibilidad de consentimiento real por parte del recluso.

Carney insistió en que las suposiciones tradicionales de prosperidad y seguridad automática por geografía y alianzas ya no son válidas, y abogó por una mayor autonomía estratégica en áreas clave como energía, alimentos, minerales críticos, finanzas y cadenas de suministro.

Aquella interfaz, con sus grandes bloques de colores y menú de inicio a pantalla completa, fue muy criticada y rechazada por los usuarios de ordenadores de escritorio tradicionales, ya que estaba pensada principalmente para dispositivos táctiles y móviles como tablets y teléfonos.

El artículo de Hackaday destaca la ironía de llevar a Linux —un sistema abierto y contrario a muchas prácticas de Microsoft— una de las interfaces más emblemáticas y odiadas de la compañía.

Uno estaba destinado a Marruecos para financiar el suministro de tranvías en Casablanca, condicionado a que una empresa española ganara la licitación, algo que finalmente no ocurrió.

Anthony Scaramucci, exdirector de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca y fundador de SkyBridge Capital, señala que aunque las cifras nominales de dinero, propiedades o inversiones parezcan crecer con los años, el valor real puede disminuir significativamente. Scaramucci pone el ejemplo de la casa que sus padres compraron en 1962 por 16.000 dólares, lo que equivalía a 457 onzas de oro. Hoy, esa misma casa se valora en 750.000 dólares, pero en términos de oro, su valor se ha reducido a 227 onzas. De esta forma, aunque en papel se vea un aumento enorme, el poder adquisitivo real ha caído. También subraya que un millón de dólares actuales equivaldría aproximadamente a 122.819 dólares de 1970 según el cálculo del CPI de EE. UU., demostrando que el dólar ha perdido valor con el tiempo.

La información, adelantada por el diario The Globe and Mail y confirmada por dos altos funcionarios del Gobierno canadiense, no constituye un plan militar operativo, sino una modelización conceptual que evalúa escenarios extremos derivados del deterioro político entre ambos países.

Según el análisis, las fuerzas armadas canadienses, con unos 100.000 efectivos entre personal activo y reservas, no podrían resistir más de una semana frente a la superioridad militar estadounidense. Ante ese escenario, la respuesta canadiense pasaría por adoptar tácticas de guerra de guerrillas, similares a las empleadas históricamente por los afganos frente a potencias militares muy superiores, basadas en emboscadas, sabotajes y acciones de pequeñas unidades paramilitares o civiles armados.

El partido estuvo marcado por una gran controversia arbitral: en el minuto 92 se anuló un gol a Senegal por una supuesta falta sobre Achraf Hakimi, y poco después el árbitro congoleño Jean-Jacques Ngambo Ndala señaló un penalti a favor de Marruecos por un leve contacto sobre Brahim Díaz, tras revisar el VAR. Esto provocó que el seleccionador senegalés ordenara a sus jugadores abandonar el campo durante más de veinte minutos en señal de protesta, con intentos de invasión del césped por parte de aficionados.

Vistisen afirmó con firmeza que Groenlandia forma parte del Reino de Dinamarca desde hace 800 años, que es un territorio integrado y que no está en venta, en respuesta a las renovadas presiones de Trump para que Estados Unidos adquiera el control de la isla ártica, considerada estratégica por motivos de seguridad nacional y mundial.

El parlamentario, de 38 años, escaló su intervención con un insulto explícito: «Señor Presidente, f—k off» (en español, algo como «que te j—an» o «vete a la m—da»), utilizando un lenguaje que consideró comprensible para Trump. Tras pronunciar estas palabras en inglés, continuó su discurso en danés y abandonó la tribuna.

Según los datos de la Corporación de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petrolíferos (CORES), el país ha pasado de no importar crudo estadounidense hasta 2016 a convertir a Estados Unidos en su primer proveedor de petróleo en la actualidad. Desde hace cuatro años, el crudo procedente de EEUU lidera el volumen de importaciones, con cifras que alcanzaron los 10,2 millones de toneladas en 2024 y 9,13 millones en 2025.

Este giro se explica por varios factores. En primer lugar, la liberalización de las exportaciones de crudo por parte de EEUU a partir de 2016 abrió la puerta a nuevos mercados como el español. Posteriormente, la pandemia no frenó esta tendencia y la guerra de Ucrania, junto al veto europeo al petróleo ruso y las restricciones al crudo venezolano, reforzaron aún más la apuesta por el suministro estadounidense.

Así lo ha señalado la secretaria de Estado de Deportes, Christiane Schenderlein, en declaraciones a la AFP, subrayando el respeto del Ejecutivo federal a la autonomía del deporte.

La polémica surge en un contexto de creciente tensión política internacional, después de que Donald Trump, presidente de Estados Unidos, haya amenazado con anexionarse Groenlandia y con imponer aranceles más altos a los países europeos que se opongan a sus planes. Estas declaraciones han generado inquietud en Alemania y han abierto un debate público sobre la idoneidad de participar en un evento deportivo de primer nivel organizado en gran parte por Estados Unidos.

Mientras continúa la investigación sobre las causas del siniestro, el Ministerio de Transportes ha confirmado que la línea no recuperará la normalidad hasta, al menos, los primeros días de febrero. Esta situación ha tenido un impacto inmediato en la movilidad de miles de viajeros y, sobre todo, en el precio del transporte alternativo.

Con la Alta Velocidad fuera de servicio, la demanda de vuelos entre Madrid y Andalucía se ha disparado. Como consecuencia, numerosos usuarios han denunciado subidas extremas en los precios de los billetes de avión, que en algunos casos han llegado a superar los 1.000 euros por trayecto, cuando lo habitual es que cuesten en torno a 50 euros.

Describe cómo una clienta de clase media-alta, acompañada de su madre, exige a una empleada bancaria realizar una operación no permitida por la normativa interna. Ante la negativa cortés de la trabajadora, la clienta reacciona con indignación no solo por el rechazo, sino por el hecho de que una persona situada más abajo en la jerarquía social se atreva a negarle algo.

Esta anécdota sirve para mostrar cómo las estructuras de clase se manifiestan en interacciones aparentemente banales. La clienta ha interiorizado que las reglas son flexibles cuando se cuenta con capital económico, cultural o simbólico, y percibe como natural su derecho a exigir excepciones.

Analizando datos de más de 3 800 participantes de 70 años o más, los investigadores observaron que aquellos vacunados presentaban niveles más bajos de inflamación crónica y perfiles genéticos más jóvenes en comparación con los no vacunados. Este efecto parece persistente incluso años después de la inmunización. La inflamación sistémica de bajo nivel, conocida como 'inflammaging', está asociada al desarrollo de enfermedades cardiovasculares, deterioro cognitivo y fragilidad, por lo que su reducción puede contribuir a un envejecimiento más saludable.

Little Saint James fue adquirida de manera privada por Jeffrey Epstein en 1998, mucho después de la cesión estadounidense. La isla se hizo tristemente famosa por los presuntos delitos sexuales de Epstein y por las investigaciones y demandas legales posteriores. Esta confusión ha generado memes y comentarios sobre la relación entre la compra histórica de tierras y la notoriedad de Epstein. Por otro lado, la noticia también se contextualiza en la actualidad, ya que el expresidente Donald Trump ha mostrado interés en comprar Groenlandia, lo que ha reavivado debates sob]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aclarando-la-venta-de-las-islas-virgenes-epstein-island-no-fue-comprada-por-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/aclarando-la-venta-de-las-islas-virgenes-epstein-island-no-fue-comprada-por-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PCV solicita al gobierno aclarar la visita del director de la CIA en Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Partido Comunista de Venezuela (PCV), a través de su secretario general Oscar Figuera, ha pedido a la cúpula gubernamental ofrecer explicaciones sobre la reciente visita de John Ratcliffe, director de la CIA, a Venezuela. El PCV considera a Ratcliffe un personaje ligado a operaciones militares contra el país y denuncia que su presencia no ha sido comunicada oficialmente a la población. Según Figuera, esta visita refleja un aumento de la influencia del imperialismo estadounidense en el Estado venezolano, evidenciada también tras la agresión militar del 3 de enero, que incluyó el secuestro de altos funcionarios. Además, el PCV critica las reformas legales impulsadas por la actual administración, como la Ley de Hidrocarburos y la ley antibloqueo, y la creación de fideicomisos para gestionar recursos petroleros bajo control extranjero.

Ford, el portaaviones nuclear más avanzado de la Marina de Estados Unidos, enfrenta un problema crítico que amenaza su operatividad: su sistema de saneamiento de residuos, conocido como VCHT, sufre atascos recurrentes desde su entrada en servicio, afectando la vida a bordo y la eficiencia del buque. Este sistema de vacío, diseñado para mover residuos a través de cientos de kilómetros de tuberías hasta tanques de tratamiento, no soporta la carga de más de 4.000 tripulantes y se ve agravado por objetos inapropiados que se arrojan a los inodoros, así como por la complejidad añadida de los baños neutrales sin urinarios. Los fallos generan situaciones de insalubridad y obligan a reparaciones constantes que requieren costosos lavados con ácido, imposibles de realizar en alta mar, lo que limita la autonomía logística que caracteriza a este tipo de buques. El problema no es aislado; su predecesor, el USS George H. W. Bush, ya mostró graves fallos en 2011.

Describe cómo, tras la llamada 'liberalización' del sector con la entrada de operadores privados como Ouigo e Iryo junto a Renfe, ha cambiado la experiencia del viajero: antes los trenes AVE destacaban por su puntualidad (incluso con compensaciones por retrasos de 15 minutos), pero ahora predominan los retrasos frecuentes, la confusión en los vestíbulos de las estaciones (donde las vías se anuncian con muy poca antelación, generando aglomeraciones y estrés), los transbordos complicados y una sensación general de desorganización y desajuste en el servicio.

Ante esta presión, algunos analistas plantean que la UE podría recurrir a un instrumento financiero potente: la venta masiva de activos estadounidenses, conocida como 'Sell America'. Europa posee entre ocho y doce billones de dólares en bonos del Tesoro, acciones y otros activos de EE.UU., representando cerca del 40% de la deuda pública estadounidense en manos extranjeras. Países como Bélgica, Luxemburgo, Francia e Irlanda destacan como grandes tenedores, junto al Reino Unido (fuera de la UE). Esta acumulación se debe a los superávits por cuenta corriente europeos, que han financiado durante años los déficits gemelos de EE.UU.

Destacó que este pacto podría crear un mercado de casi 2.000 millones de personas, representando cerca de una cuarta parte del PIB mundial, y algunos lo denominan 'la madre de todos los acuerdos'. Von der Leyen enmarcó esta iniciativa en la estrategia europea de fortalecer alianzas económicas globales, diversificar cadenas de suministro y reducir dependencias estratégicas, optando por el comercio justo frente al proteccionismo.

El exgeneral Shirreff, en un artículo para el Daily Mail, considera que Europa ha fallado al adoptar una política de apaciguamiento y que Estados Unidos se comporta como un actor hostil, calificándolo incluso de “depredador”. Esta situación podría desencadenar un conflicto en territorio groenlandés, lo que supondría el fin de la OTAN.

Encerradas tras murallas defensivas, las urbes no podían crecer hacia el exterior, lo que llevó a aprovechar cualquier espacio disponible. El puente ofrecía suelo ‘nuevo’, sin necesidad de ampliar murallas, y además permitía a los ayuntamientos recaudar rentas.

Estos puentes-calle eran el centro neurálgico del comercio, ya que todo el tránsito de personas y mercancías pasaba por ellos. Artesanos y mercaderes instalaban sus tiendas en la planta baja y vivían encima, beneficiándose en muchos casos de exenciones fiscales.

Recordó que la isla fue capturada por Noruega en el siglo XIII, pasó a control danés en el XIX y se integró como territorio asociado a Dinamarca solo a mediados del siglo XX. Estas afirmaciones coinciden parcialmente con los argumentos del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien busca el control de la isla por motivos de seguridad nacional, en medio de una creciente tensión diplomática entre EE.UU. y Europa que, según Lavrov, pone en riesgo la unidad de la OTAN y evidencia una crisis acumulada en Occidente. El jefe de la diplomacia rusa vinculó el debate a legados coloniales europeos, mencionando casos como las Malvinas, las islas Chagos, la Polinesia Francesa y Nueva Caledonia como ejemplos de problemas pendientes.

Estas compras se realizaron de forma escalonada entre noviembre de 2023 y noviembre de 2024 a través de la sociedad Joasa 2012, de la que Bono es administrador único y en la que ostenta el 100% de participación. Los inmuebles figuran contablemente como Ben Charki 28, 30, 32, 36 y 38-40, con valores individuales que varían entre 10.000 y 100.000 euros, lo que sugiere que podrían tratarse de unidades independientes o de un mismo complejo residencial dividido registralmente, algo habitual en Marruecos para propiedades grandes.

La noticia destaca el contexto político: durante su carrera, Bono mantuvo una postura crítica hacia Rabat, alineada con la tradicional defensa del PSOE del referéndum de autodeterminación en el Sáhara Occidental.

Estas inspecciones, realizadas hace dos meses, incluían un control dinámico de los sistemas tecnológicos y de comunicación con el centro de control, y un análisis geométrico de la vía que evaluaba nivelación, alineación, peralte y ancho.

Fondos de pensiones daneses, como AkademikerPension, Laerernes Pension y PFA, han comenzado a reducir sus inversiones en bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, citando preocupaciones sobre la sostenibilidad de la deuda y la disciplina fiscal de EE. UU., así como la debilidad del dólar. Aunque el volumen de estas ventas es pequeño comparado con el mercado global, su simbolismo refleja un replanteamiento sobre la seguridad de los activos estadounidenses. El secretario del Tesoro, Scott Bessent, trató de tranquilizar a los inversores y a la UE, calificando la reacción como una “histeria” similar a la generada por los anuncios arancelarios anteriores de Trump.

Jové califica de 'insostenible' el mantenimiento de centros en municipios rurales con baja matrícula debido al envejecimiento poblacional, como Degaña, San Tirso de Abres o Villayón. Argumenta que el coste medio por plaza es de 9.100 euros al año por niño, llegando hasta 20.500 euros en algunos concejos rurales, frente a los 1.973 euros en guarderías concertadas privadas.

Este cambio se produjo tras la invasión rusa de Ucrania en 2022 y la reducción drástica de las importaciones rusas (de 50% en 2021 a 12% actual), con un veto total al gas ruso en marcha. Sin embargo, el deterioro de las relaciones transatlánticas bajo la presidencia de Donald Trump genera alarma: amenazas de aranceles a países europeos (incluidos Francia, Alemania, Dinamarca y Reino Unido) para forzar la venta de Groenlandia (territorio danés) podrían poner en riesgo el suministro energético.

La noticia recuerda este suceso en su 45º aniversario, destacando las tensiones internacionales que rodearon el gobierno de Whitlam.

Whitlam incomodaba tanto a Estados Unidos (durante la presidencia de Nixon y Ford) como al Reino Unido, principalmente por su intención de revisar el funcionamiento de la base militar conjunta Pine Gap, una instalación clave de inteligencia estadounidense en el desierto australiano utilizada para espionaje y seguimiento de misiles.

El suceso ocurrió en medio de intensas protestas contra las operaciones masivas de inmigración de ICE en Minnesota, que incluyen redadas y detenciones.
