While the idea of an ocean rich in ammonia and other compounds has been supported by Cassini's data, a new study challenges this notion by analyzing Titan's response to tidal forces. The original hypothesis suggested a liquid ocean nearly 250 km thick, but new research indicates that instead of a global ocean, Titan might have multiple layers of different types of ice, with potential liquid water pockets. Titan's unique environment, including its methane lakes and thick atmosphere, makes it a fascinating target for NASA's Dragonfly mission, launching in 2028. This mission will explore Titan's dunes and study a region known as the Selk crater, which may have once hosted liquid water and complex organic molecules, important for astrobiological research. The revised theory also suggests that Titan's current state could be the result of a relatively ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titan-s-potential-internal-ocean-remains-uncertain</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/titan-s-potential-internal-ocean-remains-uncertain</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 07:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forest City: A $30 Billion Real Estate Failure in Malaysia]]></title><description><![CDATA[Forest City, an ambitious real estate project in Malaysia, was designed to house 750,000 residents and attract foreign investment, particularly from China. Launched in 2006, the development faced numerous challenges, including political changes, stricter regulations on foreign property ownership, and the COVID-19 pandemic. As of early 2025, the population of the city is a fraction of the expected number, with only around 10,000 people living in the area. Despite over $30 billion invested, the island city remains almost deserted, with many buildings and shops empty. Forest City is owned largely by China's Country Garden, which struggled with massive debt, and a local Malaysian investment fund. While the city is being maintained to look pristine, it has faced ecological and diplomatic concerns due to its location in the Strait of Malacca, a critical maritime passage. The Malaysian government has offered tax exemptions to attract more residents, and the city is being marketed as a destina]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forest-city-a-30-billion-real-estate-failure-in-malaysia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forest-city-a-30-billion-real-estate-failure-in-malaysia</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Morocco Expands Its Military Modernization Through Israeli Arms Purchases]]></title><description><![CDATA[Morocco continues to expand its military capabilities by purchasing strategic armaments from Israel, signaling a deepening defense relationship between Rabat and Tel Aviv. The article notes that Israel’s defense industry has broadened its client base from Southeast Asia to North Africa, with Morocco validating a new order for heavy artillery within the year. It mentions deployments of Israeli-made equipment in other regional conflicts, illustrating that international criticism of the Gaza war has not disrupted Israeli arms exports. Leading defense companies such as Elbit Systems and Rafael are highlighted as key players in this growth. Morocco reportedly made a significant investment, signing an agreement estimated at 150 to 200 million euros for ATMOS artillery systems, supplementing existing acquisitions like the PULS rocket launcher and the Barak MX air defense shield.

In a recent blog post, the author reflects on the critical themes of the documentary and shares a poignant excerpt that highlights the dangers of the privatization of healthcare. The excerpt features a doctor who passionately discusses how the current trend of privatizing healthcare is leading to preventable deaths. As public healthcare systems collapse under the pressure of underfunding, more and more individuals are unable to access essential care. The doctor warns that this isn't an accidental outcome, but a deliberate policy shift that prioritizes private profits over human lives. Long waitlists, overcrowded primary care, and understaffed emergency services are just some of the deadly consequences of this shift. The post emphasizes that those who promote the dismantling of public healthcare systems are not just poor managers—they are complicit in a system that is ki]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-health-crisis-the-consequences-of-privatization-and-the-collapse-of-public-healthcare</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impact of Satellite Megaconstellations on Space-Based Observatories]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent years, the deployment of massive satellite constellations such as Starlink has raised concerns about their impact on astronomical observations, including those conducted from space. Initially, some suggested that moving telescopes to low Earth orbit (LEO) could solve the issue. However, a recent study published in Nature by Alejandro Borlaff, Pamela Marcum, and Steve Howell confirms that even space-based telescopes in LEO are increasingly affected. Currently, about 9,400 Starlink satellites orbit Earth, but projections suggest that by 2040 there could be up to 500,000 satellites, causing significant contamination of astronomical images. Already, 4.3% of Hubble Space Telescope images between 2018 and 2021 were affected. Newer satellites, such as Starlink v2 Mini, are larger and brighter, exacerbating the problem. Future wide-field and all-sky survey missions like NASA's SPHEREx, the Chinese Xuntian telescope, and the European ARRAKIHS could see up to 96% of their observations ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/impact-of-satellite-megaconstellations-on-space-based-observatories</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canada’s Controversial ‘Victims of Communism’ Monument Will Remove All Names]]></title><description><![CDATA[A year after its opening, Canada's Monument to the Victims of Communism in Ottawa is facing a major controversy over the names initially set to be inscribed on the memorial. A government report revealed that more than half of the 553 names planned for inclusion were linked to Nazi or fascist affiliations. As a result, the Department of Canadian Heritage has decided to remove all individual names and instead focus on thematic content that aligns with Canadian values of democracy and human rights. The monument, designed by architect Paul Raff, originally sought to commemorate the suffering of millions under communist regimes. However, its funding and connections to controversial groups, including Nazi collaborators, have sparked criticism. This shift in focus follows widespread backlash from Jewish organizations and media outlets who raised concerns about the individuals initially listed on the memorial. The memorial, which was approved in 2009 and cost C$7.5 million to build, continues ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-s-controversial-victims-of-communism-monument-will-remove-all-names</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canada-s-controversial-victims-of-communism-monument-will-remove-all-names</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A non-clickbait, descriptive headline based on the article content]]></title><description><![CDATA[A rewritten summary of the article (200+ words, <500 words) highlighting the key points, context, and implications.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-non-clickbait-descriptive-headline-based-on-the-article-content</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-non-clickbait-descriptive-headline-based-on-the-article-content</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Airbus plans long-term move of mission-critical systems to a European sovereign cloud]]></title><description><![CDATA[Airbus is preparing to launch a major procurement process to migrate some of its most sensitive and mission-critical applications to a digitally sovereign European cloud. The aerospace group plans to issue a request for proposals in early January, with a final decision expected before the summer. The contract, estimated to be worth more than €50 million, would run for up to ten years and is intended to offer long-term price predictability.

The systems targeted for migration include enterprise resource planning (ERP), manufacturing execution systems, customer relationship management (CRM), and product lifecycle management platforms that store aircraft design data. According to Catherine Jestin, Airbus’s executive vice president of digital, the information involved is extremely sensitive from both national and European perspectives, making digital sovereignty a core requirement.

Earlier, EU leaders, including Ursula von der Leyen and Kersti Kaljulaid, had pushed for a more aggressive approach to confiscate Russian assets, but concerns over legal, financial, and ethical implications led to a reversal. One consideration, reported by the Berliner Zeitung, is that while the assets are formally state-owned, they may contain funds belonging to private individuals, some of whom could be Jewish. This raises complex questions about targeting sanctions without violating property rights or international law, drawing historical parallels to the seizure of Jewish assets during the Nazi era. The discussion highlights the EU’s balancing act between supporting Ukraine financially and avoiding actions that could be considered discriminatory or unlawful. Ultimately, political pressure within the EU led to a decision to prio]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-debates-restrictions-on-russian-assets-amid-concerns-over-private-ownership</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-debates-restrictions-on-russian-assets-amid-concerns-over-private-ownership</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hotel guest leaves room in extreme mess after two-year stay, prompting cleanup and renovation concerns]]></title><description><![CDATA[A hotel in Changchun, China, reported a shocking housekeeping scenario after a guest, described as a hardcore online gamer, checked out following a two-year stay. Staff recounted that the guest was rarely seen outside the room, and several workers did not know what he looked like due to his limited movements. Upon checkout, staff discovered an enormous mess: a three-foot-deep mountain of toilet paper, food wrappers, bottles, and takeaway containers cluttered every surface. The bathroom was severely littered, with tissues and discarded items covering the sink, and a thick brown grime covering the floor. A table and two gaming chairs were buried under waste. Cleaning required three days of back-breaking work to disinfect and restore the room. Despite the severity, management indicated no police report and no immediate plans to pursue responsibility, noting the guest still owed fees totaling nearly £300.

It highlights how France, under Emmanuel Chiva, merged military needs with private industry, pushing for civilian-to-military conversion and the stockpiling of strategic minerals. The piece contends that traditional high-cost, high-tech weapons are being deprioritized in favor of scalable, inexpensive platforms capable of operating in large quantities. The article notes a comparative advantage for Russia, which deploys vast numbers of inexpensive FPV drones daily, achieving precision and battlefield reach while costly unguided artillery loses relative efficacy. It references Ukraine as a case study where drones play a dominant role, suggesting that future battles will hinge on drone ubiquity and supply chains for mass production.

According to the text, this alleged decision would allow manufacturers to continue selling plug-in hybrid vehicles and electric cars equipped with gasoline-powered range extenders after 2035. The article frames the measure as provisional but politically significant, describing it as a capitulation driven by economic pressure, industrial decline, and growing competition from Chinese carmakers.

The piece emphasizes the difficult situation facing Europe’s automotive sector, noting that sales remain below pre-pandemic levels and exports are weakening. It argues that heavy investments made to comply with strict environmental regulations are being undermined, while Chinese manufacturers flood European m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-commission-discusses-post-2035-rules-for-hybrids-and-range-extender-vehicles-amid-pressure-on-the-auto-industry</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-commission-discusses-post-2035-rules-for-hybrids-and-range-extender-vehicles-amid-pressure-on-the-auto-industry</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 15:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minnesota Senate Bill Seeks to Include 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' in Mental Illness Definition]]></title><description><![CDATA[A bill introduced in the Minnesota Senate aims to modify the state's legal definition of mental illness by formally recognizing 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' (TDS) as a mental health condition. The proposed legislation, introduced during Minnesota's Ninety-Fourth Legislative Session, suggests amending Sections 245.462 and 245I.02 of the Minnesota Statutes to incorporate TDS alongside other recognized mental disorders. According to the bill, TDS is defined as an 'acute onset of paranoia' triggered by Donald Trump's policies and actions. Symptoms listed include intense verbal hostility toward Trump, difficulty distinguishing between policy disagreements and perceived pathological behavior, and acts of aggression toward Trump supporters or symbols associated with him. If passed, the bill would integrate TDS into the framework for case management and community mental health services.

The decision comes amid a broader defense spending spree, as the German Bundestag recently authorized over 50 billion euros for various military projects, including combat vehicles, artillery systems, and space-based assets. The MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones, manufactured by General Atomics, will be used for long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions, supporting the German Navy's existing fleet of P-8A Poseidon aircraft. This acquisition effectively ends Germany’s involvement in the EuroDrone program, a European initiative led by Airbus for developing a medium-altitude long-endurance drone. Germany’s decision is seen as a blow to the European defense industry, especially given its historical leadership in the EuroDrone project and its use of Israeli-made drones in the past.

The author, Martin Sonneborn, argues that these sanctions highlight the EU's increasing authoritarianism and disregard for the rule of law. Baud, who has written extensively on the Ukraine conflict, has been banned from entering EU territory and had his assets frozen despite having no financial ties to Russia. Sonneborn compares the EU's actions to a dictatorship, noting the lack of transparency, the inability for the accused to defend themselves, and the absence of legal processes. He also points out that similar repressive actions are being taken against others who dissent from the mainstream EU narrative on Ukraine and Gaza. Sonneborn criticizes Ursula von der Leyen's leadership, claiming the EU under her has strayed far from its founding principles of democracy and peace.

It begins with King Leopold II’s personal acquisition of the Congo in the late 19th century and the international outrage provoked by widespread abuses, including forced labor, corporal punishment, and mass mutilations. Facing growing criticism, Belgian authorities sought to rehabilitate the country’s image through large-scale exhibitions that portrayed colonization as a benevolent and civilizing mission.

A central focus is the monumental artwork “Panorama of the Congo,” commissioned for the 1913 Ghent World’s Fair. Created by Alfred Bastien and Paul Mathieu, the massive circular painting presented an idealized vision of colonial life, emphasizing economic progress, missionary work, and harmony between Europeans and Congolese people. The explicit goal, as stated by organizers, was to make the public forget the scandals as quickly as possible.

According to Salvini, the 19 sanctions packages implemented over nearly four years were intended to weaken Russia but instead have significantly harmed Western economies. He argued that these measures have contributed to economic decline across Europe and have notably driven up energy costs in Italy, placing additional pressure on households and businesses.

Salvini also warned against what he sees as the growing militarization of Europe, which he attributes to an exaggerated or 'phantom' threat posed by Russia. He questioned the strategic logic behind escalating military postures, suggesting that historical precedents demonstrate the futility of attempting to confront or defeat Russia through force. In this context, he referenced past failed military campaigns by figure]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/italian-deputy-prime-minister-criticizes-the-impact-of-sanctions-on-russia-on-european-economies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/italian-deputy-prime-minister-criticizes-the-impact-of-sanctions-on-russia-on-european-economies</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 07:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Globalized intifada?

It frames the Palestinian struggle as emblematic of a broader anti-colonial and anti-elite resistance, suggesting that slogans like 'globalize the intifada' echo historical calls for people’s power against oppressive systems. The piece links modern surveillance tech, facial recognition, and militarized policing to a broader trend of control over everyday life, positing that these tools have been developed and tested in the occupied Palestinian territories. It further contends that Israel serves as a model for how elites might manage surplus populations in a resource-scarce, climate-threatened world, with dissent framed as antisemitic when directed at this dominant narrative.

Merer, a middle-ranking official, managed a team responsible for transporting massive limestone blocks from the Tura quarry to the Giza Plateau. His day-to-day records, preserved for over 4,500 years in Wadi al-Jarf, detail a sophisticated operation involving barges called imu, canals, and an artificial harbour basin to overcome the Nile floodplain's height difference. Ro-She Khufu, an engineering marvel, allowed the transportation of heavy stones using sluice gates and ramps, later complemented by mechanical pulley systems. The harbour served as an administrative and storage hub, accommodating workers, sailors, and officials like Vizier Ankhhaf. While limestone transport was documented, granite from Aswan posed additional logistical challenges due to its weight and distance.

He criticized current agents for lacking sufficient intelligence, multimodal capabilities, computer interaction skills, and continual learning abilities. Karpathy highlighted that AI agents often cannot remember instructions or improve over time, making them unreliable. While many investors hail 2025 as 'the year of the agent,' he warned against overestimating AI's current capabilities.

This achievement is attributed to Chinese companies, including Huawei, who successfully reverse-engineered ASML's advanced EUV scanners and built a domestic version using second-hand parts. The prototype reportedly occupies a full factory floor, similar in size to modern High-NA EUV machines from ASML. The Chinese government initially targeted 2028 for producing working chips with this machine, but progress suggests it may come sooner. Huawei is leading this initiative to establish a complete domestic AI and semiconductor supply chain, reducing dependence on foreign technologies. The prototype employs laser-induced discharge plasma (LDP) technology to generate 13.5 nm EUV light, offering potential advantages over ASML’s laser-produced plasma (LPP) systems, such as reduced footprint, improved energy efficiency, and lower costs.

The author begins by asking which workers in Spain receive the highest doses of ionizing radiation. Most people would assume radiology staff in hospitals or workers at nuclear power plants, both of whom are subject to strict legal exposure limits averaging 20 mSv per year.

Aivo Peterson, Koos cofounder, received a 14-year sentence, while Dmitri Rootsi and Andrei Andronov were sentenced to 11 years each. The defendants deny any ties to Russian intelligence, but the court did not accept their arguments. Prosecutors claimed the group issued proclamations supporting Russia’s foreign and security policies and deliberately aided Russia in activities against Estonia. The government has not presented evidence of direct Russian intelligence involvement, arguing instead that Koos advocates a pragmatic, neutral, and peaceful foreign policy, including calls for Estonia to withdraw from NATO and to disengage from the Ukraine conflict. The Koos platform also proposes Estonia’s withdrawal from the NATO-backed coalition supporting Ukraine.

Speaking on The Verge's Decoder podcast, he highlighted that planned multi-gigawatt AI campuses could cost around $8 trillion cumulatively, requiring approximately $800 billion in annual profits just to service capital costs. Krishna emphasized that filling a one-gigawatt AI facility with hardware costs roughly $80 billion, and with companies planning tens to over 100 gigawatts in capacity, the financial burden grows exponentially. He noted that five-year refresh cycles for AI accelerators create compounding capital expenditures, as outdated hardware must be replaced due to rapid technological change and depreciation.

Devoret, and John M. Martinis for their pioneering work on macroscopic quantum tunneling and energy quantization in electrical circuits. Their research demonstrated that quantum effects, previously observed only at the scale of individual particles, can manifest in systems containing billions of particles. The team designed an experiment using superconducting materials separated by an ultrathin insulating layer, known as a Josephson junction. By cooling the circuit to near absolute zero and performing highly precise measurements, they observed a collective quantum behavior in the circuit, where the system tunneled through an energy barrier without the classical energy required. Additionally, they confirmed that the system could only absorb or emit energy in discrete amounts, verifying the principle of energy quantization.

Through large-scale infrastructure projects and industrial investments, China has helped transform Ethiopia into one of Africa’s most promising industrial hubs. Since joining the Belt and Road Initiative in 2013, Ethiopia has benefited from Chinese-financed projects such as the Addis Ababa–Djibouti railway, which drastically reduced freight transport times from three days to under twelve hours. This development has bolstered the country's export capacity and positioned it strategically in the Horn of Africa. Chinese companies and financial institutions — including the China Development Bank, Exim Bank of China, and firms like Huajian Group — have established industrial parks such as Hawassa and the Eastern Industry Zone, creating tens of thousands of jobs and fostering technology transfer.

According to reporting by The Intercept, the FBI, working through a Joint Terrorism Task Force with local police, used an undercover Colorado Springs police detective, April Rogers, to infiltrate left-wing and racial justice activist groups. Posing as a volunteer named “Chelsie,” Rogers gained the trust of activists at the Chinook Center, a community hub for organizing, and obtained access to internal records, emails, and personal relationships.

Once embedded, Rogers allegedly provided intelligence to the FBI and attempted to steer activists toward illegal activities, including gun-running schemes, mirroring tactics used by a paid FBI informant in Denver during the same period.

Years of poorly planned dam projects, overpumping of aquifers, and neglect of ancient qanat systems have drastically depleted both surface and underground water reserves. The qanats, centuries-old tunnels that sustainably tapped underground water, have largely fallen into disuse due to overpumping from modern wells, causing aquifer depletion and land subsidence. Iran's reservoirs are mostly empty, while rivers and wetlands have dried up, exacerbated by upstream dam construction in Afghanistan. Agriculture accounts for 90 percent of water usage, yet increasing numbers of wells produce less water than before. Hydrologists warn of impending food shortages, repeated water protests, and potential conflicts over water resources. Proposed solutions include restoring qanats, recharging aquifers, redirecting floodwaters, and shifting to less water-intensive crops, though government focus remains]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-faces-severe-water-crisis-due-to-overpumping-and-dam-mismanagement</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China leads in most crucial technologies, signaling a shift in global research leadership]]></title><description><![CDATA[A technology tracker by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) reports that China is leading research in about 90% of technologies deemed crucial because they significantly affect national interests.

This marks the first known instance of an underwater drone strike against a submarine of this type. The targeted vessel, a Project 636.3 ‘Varshavyanka’-class diesel-electric submarine, reportedly carried Kalibr cruise missiles used by Moscow in long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. According to the SBU, the operation was conducted jointly with Ukraine’s Naval Forces and the 13th Main Directorate of military counterintelligence.

The film retells the events of the Arab Revolt (1936–1939), portraying the British Empire’s violent suppression of Palestinian resistance and its indirect role in laying the groundwork for the later establishment of Israel. According to the article, the British government positioned itself as a neutral mediator in Palestine but effectively facilitated European Jewish settlement, aiming to create a loyal regional outpost under imperial influence. The movie follows figures such as British officer Orde Wingate, known for organizing brutal night raids on Palestinian villages, who also trained early Jewish militias using British colonial warfare tactics. Jacir’s film draws parallels between Wingate’s tactics and those Israel employs today, depicting a historical continuity of colonial violence and military oppression.

European leaders, including Germany’s Friedrich Merz, Poland’s Donald Tusk, and EU Council President Antonio Costa, have criticized the strategy for allegedly neglecting Europe’s interests and weakening transatlantic solidarity. However, the article argues that such responses reveal Europe’s dependence on the United States for security and its aversion to pursuing genuine strategic autonomy. Mamedov introduces the concept of 'vicarious primacy'—Europe’s illusion of global influence derived from acting as Washington’s junior partner.

La intervención ha tenido lugar en un contexto de tensas relaciones entre el gobierno de Colombia y Estados Unidos, especialmente tras las amenazas de Donald Trump de incluir a Colombia en su lista de países objetivo por su política contra el narcotráfico. Además, el gobierno colombiano ha incrementado las incautaciones de cocaína y la destrucción de laboratorios en un 8% respecto al año anterior.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/colombia-incauta-18-toneladas-de-cocaina-cerca-de-canarias-en-una-operacion-contra-el-narcotrafico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/colombia-incauta-18-toneladas-de-cocaina-cerca-de-canarias-en-una-operacion-contra-el-narcotrafico</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un diálogo filosófico sobre la inmortalidad y la imaginación en Gigalmesh]]></title><description><![CDATA[En este fascinante extracto de la serie 'Gigalmesh', los personajes Lem, AsimoV, Casandra, Chess y otros, mantienen una conversación que explora las complejidades de la creación literaria, la imaginación y la inmortalidad. A lo largo de la charla, se intercalan referencias a autores como Joyce y Borges, así como una crítica a las obras de ciencia ficción y sus legados filosóficos. Mientras algunos personajes debaten sobre la existencia de la inmortalidad en sus propios seres, otros reflexionan sobre la naturaleza de los grandes narradores del siglo XX, como Borges y Lem, cuestionando la originalidad de sus obras y destacando la importancia de la exploración literaria en la ciencia ficción. Con un tono irónico y algo de humor, el diálogo no solo profundiza en la rivalidad amistosa entre los personajes, sino que también invita a la reflexión sobre el verdadero significado de la literatura y la imaginación en el contexto de la ciencia y la filosofía.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-dialogo-filosofico-sobre-la-inmortalidad-y-la-imaginacion-en-gigalmesh</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-dialogo-filosofico-sobre-la-inmortalidad-y-la-imaginacion-en-gigalmesh</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP gana en Extremadura y el PSOE sufre su peor derrota histórica en la región]]></title><description><![CDATA[Con el 89,4% de los votos escrutados en las elecciones autonómicas de Extremadura, el Partido Popular (PP) se alza como ganador con un 42,9% de los votos válidos y 29 escaños en la asamblea regional. Esto representa un aumento respecto a las elecciones de 2023, donde obtuvo 28 escaños. El Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE), por otro lado, sufre un fuerte descalabro, perdiendo 10 escaños y descendiendo al 25,9% de los votos. VOX experimenta un fuerte crecimiento, pasando de un 8,2% a un 17,1%, con 11 escaños en la asamblea. La coalición Unides por Extremadura, formada por Podemos, IU y Alianza Verde, también consigue un notable aumento, duplicando sus escaños, al pasar de 4 a 7. A pesar del crecimiento del PP, este no logra la mayoría absoluta y sigue dependiendo de VOX para formar gobierno, lo que significa que María Guardiola necesitaría nuevamente el apoyo de los de Abascal para gobernar.

Este fenómeno se caracteriza por la aparición de nuevas sustancias, como el fentanilo, y el auge de combinaciones peligrosas como el 'rebujito' (mezcla de cocaína y heroína). Los jóvenes de la provincia, especialmente en pequeños municipios de la Sierra de Cádiz, están siendo gravemente afectados por estas drogas, que son cada vez más asequibles y más puras. El aumento de las incautaciones de cocaína y las alarmas por el fentanilo, una droga sintética extremadamente potente, están empeorando la situación. El fentanilo, considerado hasta 50 veces más potente que la heroína, está llegando a la provincia incluso a través de la correspondencia en las cárceles. Las autoridades, especialmente en las prisiones de Cádiz, han advertido de la creciente violencia y el aumento de las muertes relacionadas con el consumo de esta sustancia.

De Wever, pese a no ser un euroescéptico, fue objeto de duras críticas y acusaciones desde Bruselas por su resistencia, lo que el artículo interpreta como un ejemplo del autoritarismo creciente dentro de las instituciones europeas. Además de Bélgica, otros países como Hungría, Eslovaquia, Italia, Bulgaria y Malta manifestaron reservas ante la propuesta, temiendo que sentara un peligroso precedente y erosionara la confianza internacional en los activos denominados en euros.

En un giro reciente, se ha desvelado que López Madrid intentó sobornar al comisario retirado Jaime Barrado para que el juicio contra él nunca llegara a celebrarse.

De hecho, durante 2023, las protestas locales han llevado al aplazamiento o cancelación de 20 proyectos, sumando pérdidas de hasta 98.000 millones de dólares.

En este proyecto, basado en los diarios de guerra de Lindgren, se explica que Pippi nació como una respuesta a los horrores de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y el ascenso del nazismo. Durante esa época, Lindgren, que vivía en Suecia, fue testigo de las atrocidades cometidas por el régimen de Hitler, y su escritura se impregnó de una profunda preocupación por el autoritarismo y la opresión. La escritora, que se oponía abiertamente al nazismo, creó a Pippi como un símbolo de independencia, empatía y libertad, valores opuestos al culto a la fuerza y a la obediencia ciega. La creación de Pippi fue, además, una herramienta pedagógica para educar a los niños en un mundo marcado por la violencia y el autoritarismo, alentándolos a no convertirse en dictadores.

A lo largo de su carrera, se destacó por su labor en destapar las cloacas del Estado y la Policía Patriótica, un trabajo que la convirtió en una de las figuras más relevantes en la denuncia de las prácticas corruptas en las instituciones del país. López colaboró en medios como la revista 'Tiempo', 'Así son las cosas' y 'Diario Público', donde se especializó en investigaciones de gran calado, como el documental 'Las Cloacas del Interior', que desvelaba cómo las estructuras del poder político y policial se usaban para incriminar a opositores. Su trabajo, que le costó varias denuncias y amenazas legales, fue finalmente reconocido con el Premio Dignidad en 2017. En su último período, colaboraba con Diario Red, donde continuó su incansable lucha por la transparencia y la justicia.

Comienza con declaraciones de líderes de la industria como Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg y Eric Schmidt, que advierten sobre una burbuja en torno a la IA y la necesidad de mantener una visión cautelosa. El autor, desde una perspectiva personal, explora la posibilidad de que la IA deje de ser un espectáculo para convertirse en una herramienta cotidiana y razonablemente integrada en la vida diaria y en la economía. Describe la dinámica entre el coste, el beneficio y la atención de la comunidad tecnológica, señalando que la normalización de la IA podría pasar por una reducción de la fascinación inicial y una transición hacia proyectos más prácticos y menos glamorosos. A lo largo del texto, se evalúan escenarios de convergencia entre grandes modelos y usos cotidianos, la influencia de grandes empresas y el papel de los “nerds” y la comunidad de código abierto en la construcción de u]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ia-debe-normalizarse-cuando-y-por-que-podria-estabilizarse-el-sector-tech</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ia-debe-normalizarse-cuando-y-por-que-podria-estabilizarse-el-sector-tech</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 19:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Investigación de la Fiscalía sobre profesores 'fantasma' en colegios concertados de Córdoba]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fiscalía de Córdoba ha abierto una investigación sobre seis colegios concertados de la Fundación Diocesana Santos Mártires, propiedad del Obispado de Córdoba, ante la sospecha de que algunos docentes cobraban sueldos públicos sin impartir clases. La investigación se centra en suplencias no notificadas a la Junta de Andalucía y en profesores titulares que figuraban en los horarios oficiales pero no asistían a clases, siendo reemplazados por otros docentes con salarios menores. Los colegios implicados son Trinidad, San Rafael Obispo, Sansueña, Escuelas Pías de la Inmaculada, Jesús Nazareno y San Acisclo y Santa Victoria. La denuncia llegó tras dos quejas anónimas sobre posibles irregularidades en la gestión de fondos públicos destinados a la educación. Según fuentes cercanas a la investigación, algunos exdirectores cobraron como profesores sin enseñar, dirigiendo otras actividades de la fundación, mientras que otros docentes suplentes recibían una remuneración inferior.

En un vídeo difundido por el medio 'Periodista Digital', Ndongo se acercó al candidato y le interpeló de manera agresiva, cuestionando su candidatura por estar imputado en un caso de malversación de fondos públicos. A pesar de las peticiones de Gallardo y sus acompañantes para que Ndongo se alejara, el ultraderechista continuó con su acoso, incluso llegando a empujar y forcejear con varios de los presentes. Este incidente se enmarca dentro de una serie de actitudes violentas por parte de Ndongo, quien en el pasado ha sido vinculado a medios financiados por administraciones del Partido Popular, como 'Estado de Alarma', que recibió contratos millonarios de diferentes gobiernos del PP.

Las filtraciones, a menudo originadas por funcionarios, empleados descontentos, espías o incluso idealistas, se han convertido en una herramienta poderosa para desestabilizar gobiernos y afectar a empresas multinacionales. A través de ejemplos como los casos de WikiLeaks, los Panama Papers y las filtraciones de Snowden, O'Donnell destaca cómo las megafiltraciones no son neutrales en el escenario global y pueden beneficiar o perjudicar a países, dependiendo de quién las divulgue.

El 50,2% considera que necesita cambios fundamentales o profundos, mientras que solo el 48,5% expresa satisfacción. Este descenso se compara con 2019 y, especialmente, con el año anterior a la pandemia, reflejando una caída de cerca de 21 puntos porcentuales en la aprobación respecto al periodo pre-COVID. El informe, basado en encuestas a más de 2.400 personas, también muestra que la valoración de la sanidad pública se sitúa en 5,89 sobre 10. En Atención Primaria, la mayoría ha acudido a un médico de familia público en el último año, pero la valoración de la atención ha caído ligeramente.

El Departamento de Patrimonio Canadiense ha decidido retirar los nombres individuales previstos para ser inscritos en el monumento tras un informe gubernamental que vinculó a muchos de los 'víctimas' no verificadas con grupos nazis. Originalmente, se iban a inscribir 553 nombres en el muro conmemorativo diseñado por el arquitecto Paul Raff, pero tras el aviso de grupos judíos y medios de comunicación canadienses, más de la mitad de los nombres fueron retirados por su posible relación con el nazismo o el fascismo. Esta decisión subraya el compromiso del gobierno canadiense con los valores de democracia y derechos humanos, aunque no se ha especificado qué contenido temático ocupará ahora la pared del monumento.

A través de un debate entre Lem, AsimoV, Casandra, Chess y otros, se exploran temas como la arrogancia, la inmortalidad y la tradición literaria. Lem defiende su obra como un homenaje al héroe mesopotámico Gilgamesh, mientras que AsimoV le reprocha la pretensión de enmendar la obra de los grandes narradores del siglo XX. Casandra interviene, cuestionando las pretensiones de los autores, y Chess aporta una visión crítica sobre el impacto de Borges y otros maestros literarios en la imaginación. La discusión transcurre en un contexto surrealista donde lo preternatural y lo literario se entrelazan.

'The Book' se distancia de los manuales de supervivencia al enfocarse en el ingenio humano y la creatividad para recrear una nueva sociedad. Con un enfoque artístico y poético, el libro no pretende ser una guía técnica, sino más bien una reflexión sobre cómo la humanidad podría reinventarse después de un colapso global.

En particular, una fotografía que mostraba a Trump, su esposa Melania, Epstein y Ghislaine Maxwell ha sido eliminada. Los demócratas, liderados por Chuck Schumer, han criticado la eliminación de material y sugieren que podría tratarse de un encubrimiento. Además, se han censurado una gran parte de los documentos, con más de 550 páginas completamente negras, lo que ha generado indignación, sobre todo entre los republicanos.

A través de 39 portadas que abarcan desde 1975 hasta 2018, la muestra destaca cómo el humor y los avances científicos se entrelazan en los cómics de Francisco Ibáñez, uno de los mayores exponentes del cómic español. Personajes como el profesor Bacterio y sus inventos disparatados, como máquinas de trasplantes, clonación y otros avances, ilustran cómo la ciencia se ha integrado en la cultura popular de España. La exposición, que se muestra en el Museo Casa de la Ciencia de Sevilla, busca también trasladar un mensaje de responsabilidad ética en la ciencia, en contraste con el caos y la falta de rigor de los inventos del profesor Bacterio.

La organización, liderada por Erika Kirk, viuda de Charlie Kirk, vivió momentos de tensión donde personalidades como Ben Shapiro, Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson y Candace Owens se atacaron públicamente. Shapiro fue uno de los primeros en lanzar fuertes críticas, calificando a Owens de difusora de teorías conspirativas y acusando a Carlson de moralidad cuestionable por sus vínculos con el antisemita Nick Fuentes. Por su parte, Carlson y Kelly no tardaron en responder, burlándose de Shapiro y descalificándolo como un personaje marginal dentro del movimiento conservador. Además, la convención trató temas como el apoyo tradicional del Partido Republicano a Israel y las diferencias sobre la política exterior, especialmente en torno al conflicto con Gaza.

El proyecto contempla un centro comercial de uso mixto con comercios y actividades de ocio, que será llevado a cabo por Omo Retail. Este gran epicentro comercial incluirá tres supermercados, tiendas de ropa, colchones, un gran espacio dedicado al bricolaje, así como una zona de ocio con restaurantes, tiendas y un cine. Además, se incorporará un 'jumping park' y un club de pádel cubierto. Todo ello estará organizado en torno a una plaza verde diseñada por un paisajista.

En una reunión próxima con el expresidente Donald Trump, el primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, le informará sobre las opciones disponibles para atacar nuevamente las instalaciones iraníes. Además de los misiles, Israel está vigilando la posible reactivación de las instalaciones nucleares que fueron bombardeadas por Estados Unidos en junio. Netanyahu argumentará que la ampliación de los misiles balísticos iraníes supone una amenaza tanto para Israel como para la región en general, incluyendo los intereses de Estados Unidos. La reunión entre Netanyahu y Trump se celebrará a finales de diciembre en la residencia de Mar-a-Lago, en Florida, y se espera que los funcionarios israelíes presenten varias opciones militares, desde una acción unilateral israelí hasta operaciones conjuntas con EE.UU.

A pesar de que ambos fueron condenados en 2024, el Supremo aún no ha hecho públicas ni ratificado sus respectivas sentencias. Rato fue condenado por blanqueo de capitales y corrupción entre particulares, mientras que Zaplana lo fue por prevaricación, cohecho y falsedad documental, entre otros. Aunque las sentencias no son firmes en el caso de Zaplana, la dilatación en el proceso es llamativa, especialmente considerando la rapidez en otros casos judiciales.

La habitación estaba llena de envoltorios de comida, botellas vacías y cajas de comida para llevar, con mesas y sillas casi enterradas bajo la basura. En el baño, el papel higiénico empapado cubría el suelo y los artículos desechados se acumulaban sobre el lavabo. Se trataba de un jugador de videojuegos que alquiló la habitación para sesiones prolongadas de juego, sin salir apenas de la misma. Tras su salida, el personal tardó tres días en limpiar el desastre, pero a pesar de la limpieza, aún se necesitarán renovaciones.

Aunque Albanese es una figura respetada y popular en Italia, especialmente entre la izquierda, sus denuncias contra Israel y el apoyo a la causa palestina le han costado sanciones severas por parte de la administración Trump. Estas sanciones, además de congelar sus bienes, la han excluido del sistema bancario internacional, impidiéndole realizar transacciones financieras o incluso abrir una cuenta bancaria.

Los datos indican una caída significativa en las ventas de estos establecimientos, y el aumento de las tiendas de cercanía parece ser una de las principales razones. A su vez, las multinacionales han ido reduciendo su presencia en el mercado argentino, siendo la venta de Carrefour una de las más destacadas en este proceso. Según expertos, la falta de rentabilidad y los elevados costos de operación son algunos de los principales factores que están empujando a los inversores extranjeros a abandonar el sector.

Monsonís defiende que su obra, aunque periférica y muy independiente, ofrece una reflexión profunda sobre temas relevantes como el uso de la lengua como herramienta de represión. A través de una historia personal de su abuela, la película pone de relieve cómo los hablantes de valenciano fueron brutalmente perseguidos en la época franquista.

Entre 2010 y 2012, Dati recibió 900.000 euros de Renault-Nissan, y en la misma línea, GDF Suez (actualmente Engie) pagó 299.000 euros a un despacho de abogados relacionado con la ministra.

En un mundo donde la privatización de los servicios médicos se intensifica, el acceso a la atención se ve restringido a aquellos con poder adquisitivo. Este proceso no es accidental; es un fenómeno político deliberado, que permite que una minoría se enriquezca a costa del sufrimiento de muchos. La falta de recursos en la sanidad pública, la saturación de consultas y listas de espera interminables están provocando muertes evitables. La privatización de la salud genera una cadena de sufrimiento, donde la vida humana queda subordinada a los intereses económicos. El autor denuncia esta situación como un crimen premeditado que tiene como víctimas a los más vulnerables, pues las muertes que ocurren hoy podrían haberse evitado con un sistema de salud eficiente y accesible para todos. Aquellos que promueven este desmantelamiento son considerados enemigos ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-mercantilizacion-de-la-sanidad-y-sus-consecuencias-mortales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-mercantilizacion-de-la-sanidad-y-sus-consecuencias-mortales</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 08:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desalojados del B9 sobreviven bajo un puente tras el desalojo y la amenaza de Albiol]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Badalona, 400 migrantes desalojados del antiguo Instituto B9 se encuentran en una situación crítica tras el desalojo violento llevado a cabo el miércoles, y la represión posterior de la Guardia Urbana. Actualmente, han establecido campamentos improvisados bajo la salida 210 de la C-31, buscando refugio del frío y la lluvia. El alcalde Xavier García Albiol, conocido por su política restrictiva hacia los migrantes, ha prometido 'desmantelar todo', señalando que no se permite la acampada en la ciudad. A pesar de los intentos de organizaciones como el Sindicat d'Habitatge de Badalona para encontrar soluciones alternativas, las autoridades parecen mantener su postura. Albiol ha respondido a las acusaciones de racismo con declaraciones hostiles, calificando de 'broma' las críticas internacionales sobre el trato a los desalojados.

A pesar de que Bellingham y Courtois fueron claves, la actuación global del Madrid dejó mucho que desear, especialmente en la fase defensiva y ofensiva. El técnico alineó a futbolistas poco capacitados para presionar, lo que permitió que el Sevilla mantuviera el control en ciertos tramos del juego. Además, jugadores como Mbappé, Vinicius y Güler no ofrecieron la intensidad necesaria en sus respectivas tareas. El Madrid careció de una estructura lógica para la elaboración de jugadas, destacando la ausencia de los mejores jugadores del costado derecho y una descoordinación general en el sector izquierdo. A pesar de los esfuerzos puntuales de Rodrygo, el equipo no logró imponer su estilo de juego. La victoria, aunque importante, se vio más influenciada por las carencias del Sevilla que por una mejora clara del Madrid.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-real-madrid-sufre-por-la-falta-de-presion-y-juego-colectivo-ante-el-sevilla</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-real-madrid-sufre-por-la-falta-de-presion-y-juego-colectivo-ante-el-sevilla</guid><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 06:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EEUU incauta un buque petrolero chino frente a Venezuela: detalle, contexto y consecuencias]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia describe la incautación por parte de la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos de un buque petrolero con bandera panameña, identificado como Centuries, que transportaba crudo venezolano y se dirigía a China.

Aunque Centuries no figura en la lista oficial de buques sancionados, The New York Times explicó que la nave pertenecía a una empresa con sede en Beijing y que su carga consistía en crudo venezolano destinado a refinerías en China, lo que añade complejidad a las sanciones y a las rutas de exportación.

La historia sigue a Alba y Simone, dos mujeres de diferentes nacionalidades, mientras lidian con la presencia de una niña en un país fronterizo. La narrativa se centra en cómo cada personaje construye su propia versión de los hechos: Simone ve en la niña una oportunidad de redención, Alba percibe una fisura que desafía sus códigos, y Fátima, la madre biológica, busca ofrecer una oportunidad. La prosa de Iglesias destaca por su precisión y observación de detalles cotidianos que revelan la complejidad de los vínculos humanos, desde gestos mínimos hasta objetos con significado íntimo. La novela también aborda de manera sutil la dimensión económica de estas decisiones, reflejada en intercambios de dinero y promesas que no pueden cumplirse.

A pesar de no tener vínculos financieros con Rusia, estas sanciones se justifican bajo la acusación de difundir 'propaganda rusa'. La situación de Baud se enmarca en un contexto más amplio de represión y censura de voces críticas, tanto respecto al conflicto ucraniano como a la situación de Gaza.

El proyecto busca posicionar a Hainan como un enclave estratégico para el comercio y la financiación offshore. Además de la exención de impuestos para los productos importados, el régimen aduanero establece controles diferenciados entre Hainan y el resto de China. Sin embargo, los productos que se trasladen desde la isla hacia la China continental estarán sujetos a los impuestos habituales.

Sin embargo, esta tendencia no refleja un aumento de la estabilidad familiar, sino una realidad económica difícil.

Israel, según el autor, está diseñando un modelo para tratar a los sectores 'sobrantes' de la población en un futuro con recursos limitados y un clima hostil. Este modelo, que ya se aplica en Palestina, está basado en la vigilancia masiva, el control social a través de la tecnología y la militarización de la policía, lo que podría extenderse a las sociedades occidentales.

Esta cifra es alarmante, ya que supera significativamente las exposiciones típicas en trabajadores de áreas como la radioterapia o la industria nuclear.

Según datos del Banco Mundial, por primera vez, en 2024, la clase media mexicana supera el porcentaje de personas en situación de pobreza. Mientras que el 39.6% de la población se encuentra en la clase media, solo el 21.7% vive en condiciones de pobreza. Sheinbaum atribuye este cambio a las políticas públicas implementadas por la Cuarta Transformación (4T), que incluyen los Programas del Bienestar y aumentos al salario mínimo. A pesar de los desafíos económicos globales, México ha logrado una reducción de la pobreza del 13.6%, mientras que la clase media ha crecido un 12.4%. Estos avances han sido fundamentales para que México sea uno de los países de América Latina que más ha reducido la pobreza en los últimos años, según un informe de la Cepal. La mandataria subrayó que, aunque los avances son notables, aún queda trabajo por hacer para reducir la pobreza y mejorar las c]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mexico-supera-por-primera-vez-a-los-pobres-en-porcentaje-de-clase-media-segun-sheinbaum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mexico-supera-por-primera-vez-a-los-pobres-en-porcentaje-de-clase-media-segun-sheinbaum</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suecia rechaza la denuncia de Assange contra el Nobel por premiar a María Corina Machado]]></title><description><![CDATA[La policía sueca ha decidido no abrir una investigación tras la denuncia presentada por Julian Assange contra la Fundación Nobel. El fundador de WikiLeaks alegaba que la concesión del Premio Nobel de la Paz a la opositora venezolana María Corina Machado vulneraba el testamento de Alfred Nobel. Según Assange, Machado apoya las acciones de Donald Trump en Venezuela, lo que contravendría los principios establecidos por el testamento del fundador. En la denuncia, Assange también solicitaba el bloqueo del cheque de 11 millones de coronas (aproximadamente 1 millón de dólares) prometido a Machado, argumentando que los fondos podían ser desviados para apoyar la agresión y los crímenes de guerra. La policía sueca, sin embargo, no encontró pruebas que sugirieran la comisión de un delito y, por lo tanto, no iniciará ninguna investigación.

Se analizan las posibles tensiones entre divulgación periodística y objetivos políticos, y se examinan las dinámicas entre instituciones y figuras intelectuales de relevancia como Noam Chomsky, en relación con casos judiciales y controversias mediáticas que han marcado la opinión pública. El artículo también contextualiza el papel de actores y entidades (incluido un servicio de correos) en la difusión de informaciones sensibles, y evalúa las implicaciones de estas prácticas para la credibilidad de las instituciones y la confianza ciudadana.

La corte, con sede en Luxemburgo, ha respaldado la acusación presentada por la Comisión Europea, que denunció deficiencias en la gestión de las aguas residuales en más de 50 aglomeraciones urbanas y áreas intermunicipales, especialmente en Andalucía y Canarias. En concreto, se señaló que en numerosas localidades no se garantizaba ni la correcta recogida ni la depuración adecuada de las aguas residuales, lo que incumple la Directiva europea sobre el tratamiento de aguas residuales urbanas.

A pesar de que los jueces y fiscales no hallan indicios de criminalidad, la Audiencia de Valencia sigue adelante con la idea de enviarla a juicio. Esta situación de limbo legal ha generado tensiones entre la judicatura y las acusaciones populares de extrema derecha que insisten en la culpabilidad de Oltra. Mientras tanto, ella sigue involucrada en la política como abogada de Compromís y, aunque se le ha dejado en suspenso la posibilidad de juicio, su regreso a la política sigue siendo incierto, atrapada entre la defensa judicial y las acusaciones que no cesan de presionar.

Si en 1957, el premio de 3 millones de pesetas permitía comprar 10 pisos y 10 coches, hoy, el mismo premio, una vez descontados los impuestos, se queda en 328.000 euros, lo que da para mucho menos. A lo largo de las décadas, el aumento del precio de los décimos no ha sido suficiente para compensar la subida general de los precios, lo que ha reducido el poder adquisitivo de los premiados. A partir de 2011, el importe del premio se congeló en 400.000 euros y, desde 2013, los premios tributan, lo que ha hecho que los 328.000 euros actuales se queden aún más lejos de lo que un décimo de la Lotería de Navidad representaba en el pasado. Los loteros, que aseguran que sus márgenes también se han visto reducidos, han pedido un aumento tanto en el importe del primer premio como en el precio del décimo, que no se ha actualizado desde la introducción del euro en 2002.

A pesar de que la comunidad tiene la menor proporción de población extranjera de toda España, Vox ha incluido la inmigración como uno de los puntos clave de su programa electoral, mencionándola en 32 ocasiones. Isabel Pérez Moñino, portavoz del partido, ha alertado sobre el supuesto peligro de la 'inmigración masiva', aunque las estadísticas oficiales contradicen estas afirmaciones. Según el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE), la población extranjera en Extremadura representa solo un 4,4% del total, y la región tiene el menor porcentaje de delitos cometidos por inmigrantes. A pesar de estos datos, Vox continúa asociando inmigración con inseguridad y con una crisis de vivienda que, según el partido, se vería agravada por la llegada de inmigrantes.

Esta innovadora interpretación, que dura 14 minutos, toma como base la conocida secuencia rítmica del Bolero, dándole un giro único mediante sonidos digitales y electrónicos. Según cuenta el propio Akesson, la grabación de este proyecto requirió un total de 9 horas y 42 minutos de grabación en vídeo, 52 canales para las mezclas y el uso de 13 corbatas distintas en el proceso de creación. La versión se caracteriza por un enfoque visual y auditivo que lleva la pieza clásica a un terreno completamente nuevo, pero respetando la estructura original. Es una obra que, a pesar de su modernidad, parece rendir homenaje al legado de Ravel, quien probablemente se sentiría orgulloso de esta reinterpretación en clave tecnológica.

Originalmente enfocada en criticar la alianza entre PSOE y Vox, ha acabado denunciando supuestos fraudes electorales y anunciando un 'pucherazo' en el voto por correo. Este giro la ha colocado en una posición similar a la de otros líderes populistas, como Donald Trump, al alertar sobre amenazas a la democracia y conspiraciones. Aunque las encuestas apuntan a que Guardiola podría ser la ganadora, se espera que el PP se quede cerca de la mayoría absoluta, sin alcanzarla del todo. Su estrategia ha sido principalmente basada en la movilización de su electorado mediante el alarmismo, mientras que su presencia en debates y actos ha sido escasa.

Su historia comenzó cuando se mudó al país nipón por amor, pero terminó enamorándose de este antiguo arte marcial. Todo empezó por casualidad cuando una lesión le obligó a quedarse en casa, y fue entonces cuando descubrió el sumo a través de la televisión. Fascinado por la técnica y el estilo de los luchadores, comenzó a investigar más sobre el deporte y decidió adentrarse en él. A pesar de ser adulto y no tener la complexión de un luchador tradicional de sumo, se dedicó con empeño a aprender, y en pocos meses ya se vio compitiendo en torneos. En su primer combate oficial, Stephen se enfrentó a un rival experimentado, lo que le dio la sensación de estar siendo atropellado por un coche.

Sin embargo, el escrito carece de pruebas sólidas y se basa en suposiciones, como que los fondos podrían estar vinculados a posibles comisiones del rescate aéreo. La defensa de Gómez ha presentado un recurso para evitar que esta nueva línea de investigación se concrete. Previamente, la misma denuncia fue desestimada por el Tribunal Supremo por la falta de indicios sólidos, indicando que no se había presentado evidencia verificable.

El autor distingue entre una preferencia por un mando fuerte y la realidad de una democracia con instituciones, contrapesos y derechos fundamentales. Se argumenta que la frustración y el hartazgo político llevan a fantasear con un régimen que ofrezca claridad y orden, pero advierte que la experiencia histórica de la autocracia demuestra que ese supuesto beneficio es ilusorio: concentración de poder, represión de la disidencia y la eliminación de controles. Recalca que España, pese a sus fallos y desafíos, mantiene instituciones que permiten denunciar abusos, independencia judicial y tutela europea, mecanismos que dificultan una deriva autoritaria.

El informe destaca que las aplicaciones actuales, SIGNO (gestión de nóminas) y GESPERJU2 (expedientes laborales), no interactúan correctamente por problemas técnicos, lo que dificulta la verificación de las nóminas y la actualización de tablas salariales. Además, ciertas incidencias de nómina se calculan de forma manual, aumentando la probabilidad de errores.

La autora señala que, aunque las donaciones de gobiernos o entidades extranjeras están prohibidas, no existe una restricción clara para personas individuales, lo que crea un escenario de vulnerabilidad. Además, se menciona el caso de Vox, que ha acogido con agrado el apoyo del movimiento MAGA de Donald Trump, y se plantea la preocupación de que intereses ajenos puedan influir en las elecciones españolas. A raíz de este análisis, la autora propone una reforma legislativa para que España prohíba definitivamente las donaciones extranjeras, garantizando así la independencia y soberanía política del país.

Como parte de los llamados 'niños de la guerra', recibió una prestación española tras la ley 3/2005 para compensar la expatriación forzosa durante la infancia. Tras décadas en Rusia, donde trabajó 40 años, volvió a España con su esposa, también rusa.

Según un informe preliminar de la Policía Local de Palma, un testigo vio al conductor utilizando su móvil poco antes de que perdiera el control de su vehículo, un Mercedes, y arrollara a la familia. La pareja del implicado confirmó que el hombre conducía de manera errática antes del incidente, mencionando que incluso golpeó los bordillos. Las autoridades están analizando el móvil del conductor, que ha sido incautado, para determinar si la distracción fue la causa del atropello. El conductor dio negativo en las pruebas de alcohol y drogas y declaró que sufrió una indisposición mientras conducía. El accidente se produjo en un cruce de calles en Coll d'en Rabassa, frente a una carnicería, y dejó también heridas a la madre y la abuela de la niña, quienes fueron trasladadas al hospital]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-movil-por-parte-del-conductor-clave-en-la-investigacion-del-atropello-mortal-en-coll-d-en-rabassa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-movil-por-parte-del-conductor-clave-en-la-investigacion-del-atropello-mortal-en-coll-d-en-rabassa</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El fin de Led Zeppelin: La muerte de Bonham y el legado perdurable del rock]]></title><description><![CDATA[En diciembre de 1980, Led Zeppelin, una de las bandas más influyentes de la historia del rock, anunció su disolución tras la trágica muerte de su batería, John Bonham. Bonham falleció a los 32 años debido a una asfixia provocada por su propio vómito, un trágico desenlace que marcó el fin de la banda. Aunque la relación entre los miembros de Led Zeppelin ya arrastraba tensiones internas y problemas con las adicciones, la muerte de Bonham fue el golpe definitivo. La banda, conocida por su habilidad para mezclar géneros como el blues, el folk celta y los ritmos orientales, no vio posible continuar sin su batería, cuyo estilo único había sido fundamental en su sonido. En lugar de buscar un reemplazo, los miembros restantes decidieron poner fin a la historia de Led Zeppelin con una breve nota que decía: 'No podemos continuar como éramos'. Aunque la banda terminó oficialmente en 1980, su legado perdura hasta hoy, con conciertos recordados como el último de 1977 en Berlín y la posterior reuni]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fin-de-led-zeppelin-la-muerte-de-bonham-y-el-legado-perdurable-del-rock</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fin-de-led-zeppelin-la-muerte-de-bonham-y-el-legado-perdurable-del-rock</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La caída de la audiencia de la Fórmula 1 en España: ¿qué está detrás de la crisis en DAZN?]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fórmula 1 ha vivido en España sus mejores años gracias a Fernando Alonso, pero en 2025, las audiencias de este deporte en el país han descendido drásticamente. La media de espectadores en las transmisiones de DAZN fue de solo 430.000, lo que representa un 7,7 % de share, cifras muy alejadas de los 4,6 millones de espectadores en 2007, cuando Alonso estaba en su máximo esplendor. Esta pérdida de interés es atribuida a varios factores, entre ellos, el cambio en el modelo de transmisión de la F1, que dejó la televisión en abierto para mudarse a plataformas de pago como Movistar+ y DAZN. La piratería también ha jugado un papel importante, ya que muchos aficionados recurren a alternativas ilegales para ver las carreras sin pagar. A pesar de la alta calidad de los comentaristas, como Antonio Lobato y Pedro Martínez de la Rosa, DAZN no ha logrado enganchar a un público amplio.

A pesar de las enormes inversiones realizadas en IA, la reacción general ha sido de fatiga y rechazo, ya que los consumidores no han pedido estas mejoras y consideran que la IA no ha supuesto ninguna revolución. De hecho, en el caso de Windows 11, la obsesión de Microsoft por meter IA en cada rincón del sistema ha provocado que muchos usuarios busquen maneras de eliminarla.

Este centro es uno de los mayores centros de investigación científica en meteorología y cambio climático en el país. La decisión ha generado una gran preocupación entre científicos y autoridades locales, ya que el NCAR es crucial para la predicción de fenómenos extremos como huracanes, tormentas y otros desastres naturales. La administración de Trump justifica la medida alegando que el NCAR es un centro de ‘alarmismo climático’ y que sus funciones se trasladarán a otras entidades o ubicaciones. Sin embargo, la comunidad científica advierte que esta reorganización podría generar pérdidas de eficiencia en la predicción del tiempo y en la capacidad de respuesta ante desastres.

Otero también relató cómo el Gobierno de Suárez gestionó la legalización del Partido Comunista y los intereses de Washington durante esa época. Además, criticó la falta de acción contra la corrupción en el panorama político español y abordó otros temas como la resistencia de Felipe González a aceptar la monarquía y las tensiones internas dentro de UCD.

Tras documentar el hallazgo en un vídeo, Luna mostró la situación en la que se encontraban las aves atrapadas, algunas muertas y otras aún vivas pero agotadas. Con cuidado, las liberó una por una, y algunas fueron trasladadas a un lugar seguro para su recuperación antes de ser soltadas nuevamente. La red, que representaba un peligro tanto para la fauna como para la maquinaria agrícola, fue retirada para evitar más daños. Esta práctica ilegal está prohibida en España y Europa, ya que no solo pone en riesgo a las aves, sino que también supone un peligro para los agricultores.

El hallazgo se logró gracias a una misión científico-técnica franco-española y el uso de tecnología avanzada, como sondas multifrecuencia y documentos históricos recuperados de las familias de los marinos. El submarino fue saboteado por su propia tripulación para evitar que cayera en manos aliadas durante la Operación Torch, una serie de desembarcos en el norte de África. Tras varios intentos fallidos de localización, el equipo de investigadores ha conseguido ubicar con precisión el lugar donde se hundió el Le Tonnant, lo que permite avanzar en el estudio de otros submarinos desaparecidos de la época.

Karpathy destacó que no busca un futuro en el que la IA haga a los humanos innecesarios; por el contrario, aboga por una colaboración entre humanos y agentes de IA, donde estos últimos ayuden a codificar y ejecutar tareas mientras los humanos aprenden y mejoran sus habilidades.

Lo controvertido de la medida es que, por primera vez, solo los restaurantes cántabros con tres estrellas Michelin podrán optar a realizar este evento, lo que ha dejado fuera a muchos establecimientos de la región que no cumplen con esta condición. Esta decisión ha sido tachada por el PSOE de elitista y discriminatoria, argumentando que limita las oportunidades para muchos buenos cocineros cántabros que, aunque no tengan tres estrellas Michelin, son igualmente capaces de ofrecer un servicio de calidad. La medida ha sido criticada por la falta de igualdad de oportunidades y por favorecer solo a un único restaurante, El Cenador de Amós, propiedad de Jesús Sánchez, el único en Cantabria con tres estrellas Michelin.

Además, se han producido avances en el acceso al agua potable, la reapertura de algunos centros de salud y la respuesta a las recientes tormentas invernales mediante la entrega de tiendas de campaña, mantas y ropa. A pesar de estos progresos, Guterres subrayó que la situación sigue siendo muy frágil debido a la destrucción de infraestructuras, la escasez de suministros y las restricciones de entrada de materiales.

Además, se incorporan derechos como un día adicional de asuntos propios, un día más de vacaciones y mejoras en la protección ante bajas médicas. El complemento para la Incapacidad Temporal (IT) se ajusta para cubrir el 100% de la base reguladora entre el día 10 y el día 120 de baja, y el plus de nocturnidad pasa del 20% al 25% en 2027, con un incremento del 5% adicional en 2026.

Se señala que la inactividad física ya es una “pandemia silenciosa” y que caminar o ir en bicicleta constituye la forma más eficiente de integrar ejercicio en la rutina diaria de los jóvenes. Diversos estudios citados sugieren que el uso del patinete reduce el gasto energético comparado con caminar y puede desplazar la movilidad activa hacia trayectos cortos, lo que podría disminuir la actividad física diaria y la interacción social asociada al transporte activo. Además, se destaca un incremento en lesiones graves entre usuarios jóvenes, supported por datos de la DGT que muestran aumentos significativos en hospitalizaciones y fallecimientos por accidentes con vehículos de movilidad personal.

La sentencia subraya que ese órgano ha vulnerado el principio de tutela judicial efectiva y ha desobedecido la primacía y la autonomía del Derecho de la UE. Entre 2015 y 2023, reformas del sistema judicial polaco bajo el gobierno conservador transformaron el control sobre tribunales superiores, generando un conflicto con la Comisión Europea y conduciendo a la suspensión de fondos de la UE. Aunque la sentencia teóricamente debería desencadenar reformas nacionales para restaurar la independencia, los esfuerzos de los gobiernos sucesivos no han logrado revertirlas, principalmente porque los presidentes polacos han vetado o prometido vetar cambios legislativos para revertir las reformas.

En todos estos escenarios, se anticipaba una espiral de caos, violencia y conflicto prolongado en Venezuela, incluyendo enfrentamientos internos, un éxodo masivo de refugiados y la posibilidad de intervención extranjera. Los expertos alertaron de que un cambio de poder abrupto podría llevar a la nación a una guerra civil o a un vacío de poder que favorezca a actores armados rivales. Aunque algunos políticos opositores, como María Corina Machado, defienden que la caída de Maduro no necesariamente conduciría a una guerra civil, muchos analistas advierten sobre los riesgos y las secuelas devastadoras de una transición violenta. La posibilidad de una intervención militar extranjera también podría desestabilizar aún más la región, con efectos negativos tanto para Venezuela como para sus vecinos.

El motivo de la demanda son los mensajes difundidos por Pérez, quien advirtió que divulgaría supuestas informaciones de acoso sexual y abuso de poder si el regidor no dimitía. La denuncia fue presentada este miércoles, y se ha dirigido al Tribunal Supremo, dado que Pérez tiene la condición de aforado. Landaluce aseguró que esta no es la primera vez que el eurodiputado lanza acusaciones en su contra, recordando un incidente previo en el que Pérez difundió capturas de conversaciones privadas entre concejalas algecireñas. El alcalde ha destacado que, a pesar de las reiteradas acusaciones, nunca ha existido una denuncia formal en su contra.

Según el sindicato, este sistema determina de forma automática tareas, ritmos, ubicación, pausas y productividad, sin margen de autonomía ni supervisión humana efectiva, imponiéndose de manera generalizada y sin considerar las condiciones laborales ni las particularidades de cada trabajador. Se señalan riesgos ergonómicos y psicosociales derivados del trabajo repetitivo y de las cargas mal manipuladas, con posibles lesiones y problemas de salud mental. La evaluación psicosocial habría mostrado que entre el 69,11% y el 87,25% del personal se ve obligado a acelerar el ritmo de trabajo.

El caso está relacionado con la contratación de Cristina Álvarez, una asesora vinculada a Gómez, quien, según el juez, estaría cobrando un sueldo público por realizar funciones privadas para la mujer del presidente. Los magistrados destacan que el hecho de que la asesora fuera una amiga íntima de Gómez y no una funcionaria especializada en protocolo podría constituir un indicio de malversación. El tribunal subraya que la investigación está en su fase preliminar, pero que ya existen pruebas suficientes para continuar con la causa. En su resolución, los jueces sugieren que las actividades de Álvarez podrían ser excesivas y más propias de una amiga que de una profesional encargada de los asuntos protocolarios.

Este incremento ha tensionado especialmente las Urgencias de los hospitales de València y ha aumentado la presión asistencial, con registros de más de 500 pacientes diarios en algunas unidades. Ante la saturación en los hospitales de la ciudad, muchos pacientes optan por desplazarse a centros comarcales como Requena, Llíria, Alzira o Sagunt, donde, según testimonios, las listas de espera de atención primaria son largas y la atención en Urgencias es percibida como más rápida. El fenómeno, descrito por trabajadores sanitarios, se considera un desplazamiento sanitario derivado de la saturación de los grandes hospitales.

Putin recordó el origen del conflicto vinculado a un golpe de Estado en Ucrania en 2014 y a los acuerdos de Minsk, y afirmó que las negociaciones deben basarse en principios previamente expuestos por Rusia, incluyendo la neutralidad de Ucrania y la reducción de su ejército, además de exigir el reconocimiento internacional de las adquisiciones territoriales rusas de 2022 y la cooperación en materia de seguridad a medio y largo plazo.

Sin embargo, la crónica señala varias inconsistencias: De los Santos tenía 17 años en la fecha de las elecciones del 3 de marzo de 1996 y no habría podido votar, ya que no alcanzaba la mayoría de edad hasta agosto de ese año. Además, la promesa de acabar con la mili no figuraba en el programa electoral del PP para 1996. El texto detalla que la eliminación de la mili se gestó posteriormente, en el marco del pacto del Majestic con CiU y, finalmente, con la Ley 17/1999 y el Real Decreto 247/2001 bajo el Gobierno de Aznar. Se describe también que la imagen pública de Aznar y el PP sobre este tema se hizo suya años más tarde, pese a no figurar en el programa original de 1996.

Según el Departamento de Estado de EEUU, estos jueces habrían participado en intentos de procesar a ciudadanos israelíes sin el consentimiento de Israel, lo que va en contra de la postura oficial estadounidense que rechaza la jurisdicción de la Corte. Esta medida es una continuación de las sanciones previas impuestas a otros miembros de la CPI, incluidos jueces y fiscales, que han trabajado en investigaciones sobre Palestina o Afganistán.

En términos de emisiones, un turismo podría evitar unas 1,8 toneladas de CO2 al año y un autobús unas 54,2 toneladas anuales, considerando un mix eléctrico nacional de CO2 por MWh de 0,107. El artículo también subraya el impacto económico y estratégico, como la reducción de importaciones de petróleo (aproximadamente 4,4 millones de barriles al año) y la menor dependencia de divisas, aun cuando el precio del petróleo se mantenga bajo.

Según FACUA, el restaurante ganaba más dinero con las cancelaciones que con los propios clientes que acudían a cenar. La medida, que ha generado una gran polémica, pone de manifiesto la práctica de algunos restaurantes de imponer penalizaciones desproporcionadas, afectando directamente a los derechos de los consumidores. Esta sanción es un recordatorio de la importancia de respetar las normativas de protección al consumidor y de la lucha constante contra prácticas abusivas en el sector. El restaurante, por su parte, tendrá que afrontar las consecuencias de su acción y modificar sus políticas para ajustarse a la ley.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/multan-al-restaurante-el-invernadero-por-penalizar-cancelaciones-de-reservas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/multan-al-restaurante-el-invernadero-por-penalizar-cancelaciones-de-reservas</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ayuso aprueba unos presupuestos que recortan la inversión en sanidad y aumentan las rebajas fiscales a las grandes fortunas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid, liderado por Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha aprobado en solitario los presupuestos para 2026, que ascienden a 30.663 millones de euros, el mayor presupuesto de la historia de la región. Sin embargo, la mayor parte de la oposición, incluyendo PSOE, Más Madrid y Vox, ha criticado el enfoque, acusando al Ejecutivo de recortar 2.000 millones de euros en el gasto destinado a la sanidad respecto al año anterior, mientras que sigue favoreciendo a las rentas más altas con rebajas fiscales por valor de 5.000 millones. Durante el debate parlamentario, la izquierda ha denunciado que el modelo de Ayuso prioriza las bonificaciones fiscales a las grandes fortunas en detrimento de la calidad de los servicios públicos como la sanidad y la educación.

Esta decisión deja de lado la opción inicial de usar los activos rusos inmovilizados por las sanciones. La UE buscará garantizar que Ucrania disponga de los recursos necesarios para afrontar su recuperación y resistencia frente a Rusia. A pesar de la reticencia inicial de algunos países como Bélgica, la mayoría de los líderes optaron por recurrir a los mercados de capitales para este préstamo, con la promesa de que Ucrania solo tendría que devolverlo una vez Rusia pague las reparaciones por la invasión. Esta fórmula también permite a países como Hungría y Eslovaquia mantener sus obligaciones financieras al margen del préstamo.

Esta medida fue impugnada por una asociación de consumidores alemana, que alegó que modificar unilateralmente las condiciones del contrato es ilegal. La Audiencia Territorial de Múnich concluyó que la ausencia de anuncios era un factor determinante para que los usuarios decidieran suscribirse, y que la notificación de Amazon podía inducir a error sobre su derecho a imponer publicidad.

El trabajo utiliza un enfoque de electrodo diluido para aislar las partículas activas de carbono duro y medir con precisión la velocidad de inserción de sodio frente a litio. Los resultados indican que la sodación es intrínsecamente más rápida en ese material, con coeficientes de difusión aparentes mayores para el sodio. Además, el paso limitante durante la carga es el llenado de los poros del carbono duro, lo que se asocia con una menor energía de activación para el sodio frente al litio. Este hallazgo implica que, en condiciones de alta potencia, las baterías de sodio-ion podrían no solo ser una opción más barata, sino también más rápidas de recargar y menos sensibles a variaciones de temperatura, lo que podría favorecer su escalad]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/baterias-de-sodio-ion-podrian-cargar-mas-rapido-y-resistir-mejor-la-temperatura-que-las-de-litio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/baterias-de-sodio-ion-podrian-cargar-mas-rapido-y-resistir-mejor-la-temperatura-que-las-de-litio</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un vecino de Bargas voltea un coche con su tractor tras un conflicto por el acceso a su garaje]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Bargas, Toledo, un vecino volcó un coche con su tractor tras un enfrentamiento por el obstruccionamiento de su entrada de garaje.

El foco recae en Javier Esteban, hasta ahora jefe de redes y responsable de la comunicación digital del partido, quien ha sido denunciado por una presunta agresión sexual a un menor y que ha presentado su dimisión y salida de la militancia. Paralelamente, se evidencia la profunda fractura entre Vox y Revuelta, la plataforma juvenil vinculada al partido, que pasa de una colaboración aparentemente cohesionada a una disputa abierta por temas de finanzas, auditorías y control de la información. La difusión de audios internos y mensajes revela un ambiente de descomposición interna, tensiones de poder y una lucha por el control de la narrativa pública, en un momento en el que Vox intenta desvincularse de Revuelta y presentarse como una organización unida ante su base y la opinión pública.

Barrado sostiene que el empresario Javier López Madrid intentó sobornarlo a través del ex jefe de la unidad anticorrupción de la Policía, Fernando Moré, para que influenciara en el proceso judicial y evitara que Pinto llegara a juicio. Según las grabaciones y mensajes de WhatsApp recabados por la Guardia Civil, Moré habría ofrecido entre 200.000 y 300.000 euros, con la posible reducción a 20.000 euros, para que Barrado “suavizara el tema” y no testificara en contra de López Madrid y Villarejo. Este manejo habría buscado retrasar o impedir el juicio previsto para febrero de 2026.

Este fenómeno se ha visto especialmente reflejado en la población joven, con tasas más altas entre los adultos jóvenes de 20 a 29 años, y las mujeres adolescentes, para quienes el suicidio representa la principal causa de muerte. La crisis está impulsada por factores económicos, como la inestabilidad financiera, la precariedad laboral, la pobreza y la creciente presión social. Además, la promoción de valores materialistas y la influencia de las redes sociales contribuyen a un sentimiento de desesperanza. Los expertos destacan la insuficiente oferta de servicios de salud mental y la falta de atención a la Ley 26.657 de Salud Mental como factores que agravan la situación.

Por ejemplo, algunos especialistas en seguridad vial aseguran que la visibilidad de la baliza es limitada, especialmente en curvas o cambios de rasante durante el día. Por este motivo, recomiendan seguir utilizando los triángulos de emergencia como una medida adicional de seguridad. Incluso un bombero que atendió un accidente afirmó que 'no dejéis de llevar los triángulos'. La Guardia Civil también apoya esta recomendación, destacando que cuantos más elementos de señalización se utilicen, mejor.

Sin embargo, los usuarios de Twitter han explicado que estas rampas tienen un propósito mucho más profundo: evitar el ahogamiento de ranas y otros animales, además de permitir que otras especies, como el ganado, también accedan al agua.

A juicio del texto, esta narrativa ha ocultado la realidad estratégica y ha alimentado expectativas irreales sobre una derrota militar de Rusia mediante el envío continuo de armamento occidental.

Un estudio reciente reveló que los niños educados en un entorno religioso tienen dificultades para diferenciar la realidad de la ficción. El estudio, realizado por investigadores estadounidenses, comparó a niños de entre 5 y 6 años de edad, con diferentes niveles de exposición a la religión, como en escuelas públicas, colegios religiosos y catequesis. Los resultados mostraron que los niños que recibían educación religiosa eran más propensos a aceptar como reales los relatos que incluían elementos sobrenaturales o milagros, mientras que los niños sin esa formación religiosa distinguían claramente entre hechos reales y ficción.

Iglesias afirma que antes se cuestionaba la neutralidad de los jueces y que España no era una democracia plena, observando un giro político que, a su juicio, ha llevado a un cambio en la percepción pública y a un reequilibrio de apoyos entre la derecha y el Gobierno. Critica la negociación entre PSOE y PP para el reparto de vocales del Consejo General del Poder Judicial y sostiene que ese movimiento benefició a la derecha, afectando la percepción de independencia del poder judicial. En el ámbito de feminismo, acusa a Sánchez de desplazar a Irene Montero y colocar a personas cercanas a corrientes machistas, sugiriendo que ello marca un giro estratégico en la política ministerial.

La consejera de Sanidad, Fátima Matute, ha desmentido las acusaciones, señalando que no existen 'pruebas sólidas' que respalden dichas denuncias. A pesar de los testimonios de pacientes y trabajadores, y de las informaciones de laSexta que documentan la falta de personal y el uso de material reutilizado, el Gobierno regional asegura que no se ha recortado personal ni se ha reutilizado material. Ayuso ha tildado las críticas de 'chismes' y ha afirmado que las denuncias responden a un plan orquestado desde Moncloa para desestabilizar el sistema sanitario madrileño. Además, el Ejecutivo regional ha dejado de publicar los informes y auditorías sobre la gestión de los hospitales privados, lo que ha generado más sospechas.

A través de un comunicado oficial, el club informó que ha estado en contacto con la organización de la Euroliga durante todo el partido y que aportará pruebas gráficas para respaldar su denuncia. Además, se hizo énfasis en que estos comportamientos no solo son inaceptables en un entorno deportivo, sino que también dañan la imagen de la competición y el deporte en general.

Afirma que fue obtenida a petición del presidente Florentino Pérez para trabajar con jugadores como Dani Carvajal y Rodrygo, pero que recibió un trato hostil por parte del equipo médico y del personal del bufé, incluyendo presión para que no siguiera sus indicaciones y para ocultar su labor. Según su testimonio, los médicos y un fisio actuaban “en voz alta” a favor de desautorizarla, mientras que el presidente habría intervenido directamente para que ella pudiera trabajar, a veces de forma parcial y desde casa, con el objetivo de implantar un plan nutricional y de suplementos personalizado para los jugadores.

La pieza contextualiza la obra como una de las sátiras políticas más aclamadas y destaca el papel de Peter Sellers, quien interpretó tres personajes distintos: el capitán Mandrake, el presidente Muffley y el Dr. Strangelove. Se subraya la transformación del concepto de MAD de un thriller serio a una comedia negra, lo que resalta la visión de Kubrick sobre la absurdidad de la destrucción mutua asegurada. Entre los elementos visuales más recordados se encuentran el War Room, diseñado por Ken Adam, con un bunker triangular que se convirtió en un símbolo icónico del cine de Kubrick.

La exconcejal Paula González Morato había presentado quejas internas sobre el trato machista y el abuso de poder del alcalde, pero el partido tardó meses en reaccionar. El audio revela que la cúpula del PP ya estaba al tanto de la gravedad de la situación y temía que las denuncias afectaran su imagen política, especialmente en un momento cercano a las elecciones en Extremadura. La dimisión de González Morato en diciembre, tras no recibir respuesta a sus denuncias, ha puesto al PP en una situación incómoda, dado que la presidenta del partido en Extremadura, María Guardiola, se ha mostrado públicamente contra cualquier tipo de machismo.

Según Compromís, estos aumentos superan con frecuencia el 10% de la cápita acordada, mientras que la prórroga de Elx contemplaba solo un 1,5% de subida. La Consejería de Sanidad defendió que se trató de un ajuste matemático establecido por el contrato y las resoluciones técnicas, no de una negociación. El asunto ha estado rodeado de polémica por audios que supuestamente demostrarían prácticas para favorecer a la empresa, así como por exdirectivos y cambios de liderazgo en Ribera Salud.

El análisis de mensajes recuperados de un teléfono incautado mostró que el supuesto contacto pudo ser un malentendido: el código encontrado indicaba un usuario llamado Manuel García Maroto y la palabra inglesa “stranger” (desconocido), lo que sugiere que Aldama no tenía ese contacto entre sus contactos y que el interlocutor fue quien envió el mensaje.

Sectores como la agricultura, los trabajos domésticos y la hostelería son especialmente vulnerables a estas prácticas, que afectan principalmente a mujeres migrantes y personas en situación de vulnerabilidad.

Sin embargo, la versión final que llegó a los móviles de los valencianos solo pedía evitar los desplazamientos, sin hacer mención explícita al confinamiento. Este cambio de enfoque en el mensaje se debe a las dudas legales sobre las competencias del gobierno autonómico para ordenar el confinamiento, lo que retrasó su emisión.

En plena lucha por el título de 2025, el joven piloto reflexiona sobre la presión de competir al máximo nivel y sobre cómo ha aprendido a gestionar la rivalidad con su compañero Lando Norris. Según Piastri, las tensiones en pista son inevitables cuando ambos luchan en igualdad de condiciones, pero asegura que la relación personal se ha fortalecido tras tres años juntos.

En su publicación, detalla que, para alquilar un piso de 1.000 euros al mes, los propietarios piden requisitos como tres nóminas, movimientos bancarios de tres meses, fondos disponibles y un contrato de trabajo fijo, además de un avalista. Lucas asegura que este proceso es una experiencia deshumanizadora que dificulta enormemente la búsqueda de vivienda, no solo para pisos completos, sino también para alquilar habitaciones. La situación se ha agravado con precios cada vez más altos, lo que genera un sentimiento generalizado de frustración entre los jóvenes que intentan acceder al mercado del alquiler. Aunque Lucas subraya que su experiencia se limita a Madrid, este tipo de exigencias parece extenderse por todo el mercado inmobiliario español.

El evento contó con la actuación del rapero alemán Kool Savas, quien, en un intento de animar al público, condujo un Tesla Cybertruck al escenario. Sin embargo, el ambiente fue incómodo, ya que los empleados no respondieron a los cánticos que el rapero intentó iniciar, y la performance fue descrita como 'incómoda' por testigos. Además, el evento estuvo marcado por un discurso del director de la planta, André Thierig, que aprovechó para criticar al sindicato IG Metall, afirmando que los empleados solo recibirían un aumento salarial del 2% si el sindicato tuviera poder de negociación. A pesar de un aumento salarial del 4%, IG Metall considera que este incremento no es suficiente en comparación con los estándares de la industria automotriz en Alemania.

La Comisión Europea presentó dos alternativas para financiar este esfuerzo, pero la propuesta de utilizar los activos rusos ha generado resistencia en algunos países, como Bélgica y Hungría, debido a las implicaciones legales y políticas.

Según el informe FOESSA de 2024, Càritas alerta de la alta precariedad social en esta región, especialmente para los jóvenes y los inmigrantes, quienes experimentan tasas de pobreza mucho mayores que la media. Aunque ha disminuido la pobreza extrema, el coste elevado de la vivienda sigue empujando a muchos a una situación de vulnerabilidad. El informe también señala que un 15% de los hogares enfrentan pobreza severa tras pagar el alquiler. Esta situación ha impulsado una alta demanda de habitaciones compartidas, lo que ha incrementado también el precio del alquiler.

La Junta Electoral Provincial de Badajoz ya ha confirmado que los 124 electores afectados por el robo podrán votar de nuevo sin que exista alteración en el resultado electoral. El robo, ocurrido en la madrugada del jueves, afectó a una caja fuerte que contenía votos emitidos, pero la investigación apunta a que se trató de un robo común, no con motivaciones políticas.

Adaptación de la novela de Anthony Burgess, la película aborda temas como la ultraviolencia juvenil, el control social y el libre albedrío de una manera única y provocadora. El uso de la violencia estilizada y un humor macabro, sumado a la inquietante música de Beethoven, hace que la obra siga generando un impacto emocional fuerte incluso medio siglo después de su estreno. Su visión de un joven delincuente sometido a un método de 'curación' que le elimina la capacidad de decidir entre el bien y el mal toca el corazón de una crítica más profunda sobre la sociedad y el control institucional. Además, la película sigue siendo relevante no solo por lo que muestra, sino por la manera en la que obliga al espectador a reflexionar sobre su propio papel frente a la barbarie que se justifica en nombre del orden.

Esta propuesta ha desencadenado una huelga general histórica, con la participación de sindicatos como UGT-Portugal y CGTP-IN y una movilización masiva en Lisboa que, según los organizadores, habría contado con unos tres millones de personas.

Tras el parto, y con el objetivo de ocultar el embarazo, la joven utilizó un cuchillo para degollar a la bebé, quien había nacido viva. La madre ocultó el cuerpo de la niña en un armario, envuelto en toallas y dentro de una bolsa de plástico. Los médicos confirmaron que la bebé falleció a causa de un corte en el cuello. La acusada confesó el crimen para evitar que se descubriera el embarazo, aunque no presentó ninguna alteración psíquica en el momento de cometer el asesinato.

Sin embargo, estas donaciones familiares están gravadas por el impuesto de donaciones, lo que hace que el hijo receptor deba pagar impuestos y que el padre deba declarar el incremento patrimonial en su renta. En contraste, las donaciones a entidades sin ánimo de lucro, como ONGs, reciben importantes bonificaciones fiscales. Esta disparidad genera una paradoja: apoyar a hijos directamente resulta más gravoso fiscalmente que contribuir a causas solidarias. José Alberto Marín, decano del Colegio Notarial de Catalunya, explica que cada comunidad autónoma aplica esta fiscalidad de manera distinta, siendo Catalunya especialmente estricta.

En España, más de 55.000 personas conviven con esta enfermedad, un 15% más que hace 15 años, según la Sociedad Española de Neurología (SEN). Este aumento se atribuye tanto a mejoras en el diagnóstico precoz y tratamientos más eficaces, como a posibles cambios en los hábitos de vida. La EM tiene un impacto directo en la vida laboral, social, familiar y emocional de quienes la padecen, siendo una de las principales causas de discapacidad neurológica en adultos jóvenes. Además, supone un coste económico importante para las familias, con un gasto anual medio de 7.000 euros en fases iniciales, que puede superar los 18.000 euros en etapas avanzadas. El 44% de los casos depende de cuidadores familiares, quienes también sufren estrés y ansiedad. La enfermedad provoca que el 83% de los pacientes abandone prematuramente su empleo, principalmente por]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-esclerosis-multiple-incrementa-su-incidencia-en-espana-y-genera-un-alto-impacto-socioeconomico</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-esclerosis-multiple-incrementa-su-incidencia-en-espana-y-genera-un-alto-impacto-socioeconomico</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 20:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[WeLion avanza hacia baterías de estado sólido con 824 Wh/kg en laboratorio]]></title><description><![CDATA[WeLion, un fabricante chino de baterías de estado sólido, ha logrado un hito importante en sus investigaciones al alcanzar una densidad energética de 824 Wh/kg en pruebas de laboratorio. Aunque este valor representa un récord para la empresa, la tecnología aún no está lista para producción comercial. El objetivo a largo plazo de WeLion es superar los 1.000 Wh/kg, una cifra que, de lograrse, situaría a la compañía entre las más avanzadas en una de las áreas más críticas de la industria automotriz y de dispositivos móviles. Comparativamente, las baterías de litio-ferrofosfato (LFP) convencionales mantienen densidades de alrededor de 150-180 Wh/kg, mientras que otros desarrolladores de baterías de estado sólido apuntan a 350-500 Wh/kg. WeLion afirma que la densidad superior a 800 Wh/kg es una excepción en el panorama actual y no ha explicado el marco técnico preciso para mantener esa ventaja frente a competidores.

Casanova afirma que toma la decisión de revelar su condición con la intención de combatir el estigma que rodea al VIH y servir de ejemplo para otras personas que viven con la infección. Según sus palabras, este paso lo realiza con dignidad y con el objetivo de que más gente se sienta capaz de salir del armario y buscar información y tratamiento sin miedo. El cineasta subraya que la mayoría de las personas con VIH no comparten su situación por el estigma social, lo que agrava el rechazo.

El hombre presentó fuertes dolores en el antepié derecho y fue trasladado en ambulancia al hospital, donde permaneció siete horas en Urgencias esperando ser atendido. Inicialmente, el personal médico lo clasificó como emergencia baja y, tras recibir un diagnóstico preliminar de trombosis venosa profunda, fue enviado a casa. La ecografía Doppler, que habría permitido un diagnóstico correcto de aneurisma de la arteria poplítea, no se realizó porque el servicio de ecografía no estaba disponible por las tardes.

Este retraso se consideró excesivo e inaceptable y se calificó como una disfunción del sistema público de salud, afectando la oportunidad de diagnóstico y, en consecuencia, de posibles tratamientos. Aunque el diagnóstico definitivo de cáncer de páncreas llegó tras acudir a un centro privado, el TSJM aplicó la doctrina de la pérdida de oportunidad para indemnizar a la familia, concluyendo que la demora privó a la paciente de una oportunidad razonable de tratamiento en una etapa más favorable de la enfermedad.

Este proceso ha destruido gran parte de los antiguos qanats, sistemas de túneles milenarios diseñados para extraer agua subterránea de forma sostenible. La combinación de sequías extremas, cambio climático y políticas hidráulicas erróneas ha reducido drásticamente los niveles de agua en ríos, lagos y humedales, provocando la desertificación de regiones clave. La agricultura consume aproximadamente el 90% del agua disponible, mientras que la sobreexplotación de pozos ha vaciado los acuíferos y disminuido la eficiencia de los sistemas tradicionales de captación.

Esta medida se produce como respuesta al bloqueo marítimo anunciado por el presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, que amenaza con incautar cualquier embarcación sancionada que comercie con Venezuela. Los primeros barcos escoltados transportan derivados del petróleo y subproductos de la refinación procedentes del puerto de José, en el Estado Anzoátegui, y no están incluidos en la lista de sancionados por Washington. La tensión se ha intensificado tras la operación militar estadounidense contra un petrolero venezolano sancionado hace una semana, lo que provocó una protesta en Caracas. Mientras tanto, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) mantiene el envío de crudo nacional, a pesar de las dificultades derivadas de sanciones impuestas desde 2019, que afectaron gravemente a la producc]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-despliega-la-armada-para-proteger-sus-buques-petroleros-ante-el-bloqueo-estadounidense</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/venezuela-despliega-la-armada-para-proteger-sus-buques-petroleros-ante-el-bloqueo-estadounidense</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 18:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La ONU advierte de un aumento sin precedentes de asentamientos israelíes en Cisjordania durante 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Organización de las Naciones Unidas ha advertido de que Israel ha acelerado de forma significativa la construcción de asentamientos en los territorios palestinos ocupados, alcanzando en 2025 el mayor número de nuevas colonias desde 2017. Según recordó el coordinador especial adjunto de la ONU para el Proceso de Paz en Oriente Medio, Ramiz Alakbarov, estas colonias son ilegales conforme al derecho internacional y su expansión socava la viabilidad de la solución de dos Estados.

Alakbarov presentó su informe trimestral ante el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, en el que evaluó el cumplimiento de la resolución 2334, que exige a Israel el cese de toda actividad de colonización en territorio palestino. El representante de la ONU alertó de que la tendencia actual amenaza la estabilidad regional y agrava un conflicto ya profundamente enquistado.

Se baraja la opción de ampliar la capacidad submarina nacional más allá de las cuatro unidades actuales (S-81 Isaac Peral, S-82 Narciso Monturiol, S-83 Cosme García y S-84 Mateo García de los Reyes) y de reforzar la soberanía tecnológica al nacionalizar sistemas clave como la pila de combustible, los periscopios y el sistema de combate. El artículo evalúa beneficios operativos y estratégicos, incluyendo la continuidad industrial para Navantia Cartagena y la reducción de dependencia tecnológica.

Sin embargo, datos oficiales indican que entre 2019 y 2025 Madrid ha recibido 129.000 millones de euros, es decir, 43.000 millones más que durante el Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy, constituyendo la mayor financiación que ha recibido una comunidad autónoma en la historia de España. Para 2026, se prevén además 23.135 millones del Sistema de Financiación y 1.350 millones en transferencias directas. Desde el PSOE en Madrid, Óscar López ha criticado que, pese a esta financiación récord, Ayuso prioriza transferir fondos a grupos privados en lugar de reforzar la sanidad y las universidades públicas.

La Policía Local la identificó apenas dos horas después gracias a documentos personales encontrados en la bolsa donde estaban los animales. La intervención fue inmediata tras la llamada de un vecino que escuchó maullidos provenientes del contenedor. Los cachorros fueron rescatados por el refugio multiespecie La Isla de Tali, que se encargó de proporcionarles cuidados y protegerlos junto a su madre, atrapada mediante jaula en la finca de la denunciada. El Concello de Nigrán abrió un expediente sancionador bajo la Ley de Bienestar Animal de 2023, que establece multas de entre 500 y 10.000 euros para casos de maltrato animal.

El contrato, valorado en 195 millones de euros para dos años, ha generado críticas de la Asociación Galega para a Defensa da Sanidade Pública (AGDSP), que denuncia que se priorizan los beneficios privados sobre la cobertura y calidad de la atención sanitaria. Povisa ha recibido pagos por actividad y por habitante, incluso con una reducción de pacientes atendidos y la eliminación de servicios clave como neurocirugía, electrofisiología y atención a grandes quemados, que ahora se derivan al Hospital Universitario de A Coruña.

Smith indicó que además se han reunido evidencias de que Trump incumplió la ley al almacenar documentos clasificados de su primer mandato en su residencia de Mar-a-Lago, en Florida, y al obstruir los esfuerzos del gobierno para recuperarlos. Durante la entrevista a puerta cerrada, Smith subrayó que sus decisiones en la investigación no se vieron influenciadas por consideraciones políticas, creencias personales ni la candidatura de Trump en las elecciones de 2024.

Asimismo, Wiles criticó a la fiscal general Pam Bondi por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein, cuestionando la distribución de información incompleta a influenciadores conservadores.

Según la investigación, las primeras quejas se remontan a abril y no obtuvieron respuesta, llevando a González a enviar un correo el 1 de diciembre a Guardiola y otros dirigentes para denunciar las repetidas actitudes despectivas y el acoso.

En España, el idioma se difundió rápidamente entre docentes, militares y colectivos progresistas. En Zamora, el esperantismo llegó en 1908 de la mano del teniente coronel Eugenio Calvo Blasco, quien impulsó la formación de un grupo local muy activo, con una sección femenina que destacó por su entusiasmo y participación. El grupo realizó cursos gratuitos, conferencias, veladas culturales y actuaciones musicales en el Café Español, convirtiéndose en un ejemplo de dinamismo social e interés intelectual. Sin embargo, tras unos años de intensa actividad, la sociedad se disolvió en 1909 por falta de apoyo institucional y cambios entre sus dirigentes.

Assange argumenta que Machado ha incitado públicamente a la Administración estadounidense a intervenir militarmente en Venezuela, e incluso a justificar ataques contra barcos civiles frente a sus costas, lo que, a su juicio, la hace inelegible para recibir un galardón destinado a promover la fraternidad entre naciones, conforme al testamento de Alfred Nobel.

Sin embargo, tras aprobar la actividad, la decana comenzó a recibir presiones y amenazas anónimas que intentaban impedir la celebración del evento. Ante esta situación, Etura solicitó ayuda a la Subdelegación del Gobierno.

El acuerdo, valorado en 142.880 euros, se ha otorgado a la clínica VIVO Pío XII, perteneciente al Grupo VIVO, en cuyo consejo participa el exministro de Justicia y miembro del Partido Popular, Rafael Catalá. Este contrato permitirá realizar hasta 7.520 ecografías durante los próximos meses para aliviar la elevada lista de espera del hospital, que actualmente supera los 4.000 pacientes con una demora media de más de 80 días. Según el SERMAS, la medida responde a una falta de personal y equipamiento suficiente para atender la creciente demanda, especialmente por las derivaciones desde atención primaria. Los datos de la memoria de 2023 del hospital muestran una reducción del número de ecógrafos, de 31 a 23, lo que ha limitado la capacidad de respuesta del centro.

El portavoz del Ministerio de Exteriores chino, Guo Jiakun, afirmó que Pekín se opone a cualquier forma de intimidación unilateral y defiende el derecho de los Estados a salvaguardar su soberanía y dignidad nacional.

Según el Ministerio Público, aunque considera creíble el testimonio de la denunciante, no existen pruebas suficientes que acrediten que Errejón actuase sabiendo que ella no consentía la relación. En su escrito, la Fiscalía explica que, cuando Mouliaá expresó de forma explícita su negativa, Errejón detuvo su comportamiento, lo que a su juicio demuestra la falta de dolo necesario para sostener la acusación. 

El juez instructor, Adolfo Carretero, había propuesto previamente juzgar a Errejón, al entender que había indicios de un antiguo delito de abuso sexual —figura que existía antes de la reforma de la ley del 'solo sí es sí'—, al no mediar violencia ni intimidación.

Entre las actuaciones más relevantes se incluyen la subida del IVA en 2012 del 18% al 21%, la reducción de la indemnización por despido, y una reforma laboral que generó un notable aumento del empleo temporal y precario. En el ámbito social, las pensiones solo se incrementaron un 0,25% anual durante varios años, lo que supuso una pérdida del poder adquisitivo de los jubilados.

La primera se produjo al romper un cordón policial para unirse a un grupo de simpatizantes que lo apoyaban, y la segunda, por participar en una manifestación que no había sido previamente comunicada a la Subdelegación del Gobierno, como exige la normativa vigente. 
Como resultado, Quiles se enfrenta a una sanción económica de entre 50 y 100 euros. Además, cuatro estudiantes que participaron en las protestas contra su discurso ultraderechista también fueron sancionados por no haber notificado su concentración, aunque solo con una infracción cada uno. A diferencia de ellos, Quiles fue acusado de desobedecer a los agentes y de vulnerar el perímetro ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vito-quiles-es-sancionado-por-infringir-la-ley-de-seguridad-ciudadana-durante-una-protesta-en-la-universidad-de-la-laguna</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vito-quiles-es-sancionado-por-infringir-la-ley-de-seguridad-ciudadana-durante-una-protesta-en-la-universidad-de-la-laguna</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El aumento del alquiler impulsa el voto a la extrema derecha entre los inquilinos más vulnerables]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un estudio publicado en la revista *Comparative Political Studies* por los investigadores Tarik Abou-Chadi, Denis Cohen y Thomas Kurer revela una relación directa entre el encarecimiento del alquiler y el aumento del voto a la extrema derecha entre los inquilinos con menos recursos en las grandes ciudades europeas. Según el trabajo, el temor a perder la vivienda, el barrio y las redes sociales que conforman la vida cotidiana genera una sensación de inseguridad y desarraigo que empuja a muchos ciudadanos a apoyar opciones políticas populistas y contrarias al establishment. El factor determinante no es tanto la imposibilidad de pagar el alquiler como el miedo al desplazamiento y al cambio del entorno: la gentrificación, la llegada de residentes con más dinero y la transformación del tejido urbano. Este fenómeno se manifiesta especialmente en zonas de alta densidad urbana y fuerte presión inmobiliaria, donde la subida de un euro por metro cuadrado puede aumentar en más de cuatro puntos po]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-del-alquiler-impulsa-el-voto-a-la-extrema-derecha-entre-los-inquilinos-mas-vulnerables</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-aumento-del-alquiler-impulsa-el-voto-a-la-extrema-derecha-entre-los-inquilinos-mas-vulnerables</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno acusa al PP de anticipar operaciones judiciales y cuestiona el uso de información confidencial]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Partido Popular (PP) ha generado polémica tras anticipar públicamente investigaciones y actuaciones judiciales que aún no se habían ejecutado, lo que ha llevado al Gobierno a sospechar que la formación tiene acceso a información reservada.

Estas declaraciones provocaron una fuerte reacción del ministro Óscar Puente, quien denunció la falta de contención y las posibles filtraciones a favor del PP. La controversia se amplificó con un episodio en el Senado, donde el senador popular Luis Santamaría advirtió al ministro Félix Bolaños sobre próximas revelaciones judiciales.

Conocidas como los Colosos de Memnón, estas esculturas monumentales datan de hace unos 3.400 años y formaban parte del templo funerario del faraón, situado en la orilla occidental del Nilo.

El proyecto de restauración ha requerido cerca de dos décadas de trabajo y ha supuesto un complejo proceso de documentación, consolidación y reensamblaje de miles de fragmentos dispersos. Las estatuas, que habían sufrido graves daños a lo largo de los siglos debido a terremotos, erosión y expolio, vuelven ahora a mostrarse con una apariencia más cercana a la original, alcanzando varios metros de altura y un peso considerable.

Durante la inauguración oficial, el ministro de Turismo y Antigüedades de Egipto destacó la importancia histórica y simbólica de la restauración, subrayando]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/egipto-culmina-la-restauracion-de-los-colosos-de-memnon-en-luxor-tras-dos-decadas-de-trabajos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/egipto-culmina-la-restauracion-de-los-colosos-de-memnon-en-luxor-tras-dos-decadas-de-trabajos</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Estados Unidos destruye tres embarcaciones sospechosas de narcotráfico en el Pacífico]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ejército de Estados Unidos llevó a cabo una operación militar en aguas internacionales del océano Pacífico oriental, donde destruyó tres embarcaciones presuntamente vinculadas al narcotráfico, provocando la muerte de ocho personas.

La acción se realizó bajo las órdenes del secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth. Desde septiembre, el Pentágono ha hundido más de 25 embarcaciones similares en el Caribe y el Pacífico, con un saldo de al menos 95 muertos.

Dos empresarios de Puerto Lumbreras están siendo investigados como presuntos responsables de la sustracción de al menos 50 millones de litros de agua, obtenidos de un pozo clandestino sin permisos ni dispositivos de medición. Según las pesquisas del SEPRONA, la empresa implicada habría comercializado el agua con explotaciones ganaderas, empresas y particulares, llegando a facturar cerca de 275.000 euros en los últimos 18 meses. La investigación se inició tras la denuncia de 128 vecinos de la diputación de Zarzalico (Lorca), que alertaron de irregularidades en el suministro de agua a granjas locales.

El artículo describe cómo, tras denunciar abusos y malas prácticas en ámbitos del poder, fue objeto de procesos y acosos que intentaron silenciarlo, lo que simboliza el alto precio que a menudo pagan los alertadores o denunciantes de corrupción en el país.

Por un lado, la versión clásica de Joan Pous i Porta y Josep Maria Solé i Sabaté, en su obra *Anarquia i República* (1988), sostiene que la violencia en la comarca fue promovida exclusivamente por la CNT-FAI y su líder Antonio Martín, «El Cojo de Málaga». Esta visión, cercana al nacionalismo catalán institucional, presentó a los anarquistas como agentes del caos y a las fuerzas republicanas y catalanistas como defensores del orden. Por otro lado, la revisión de Antonio Gascón y Agustín Guillamón en *Nacionalistas contra anarquistas en la Cerdaña (1936-1937)* (2018) desmantela esa lectura a través de un extenso trabajo documental basado en archivos franceses, actas municipales, informes judiciales y listas de milicianos.

Inspirándose en pensadores como Bertrand Russell y en su propio libro 'Metafísica de la pereza', Valls Boix defiende el valor de no hacer nada como modo de recuperar la libertad y la capacidad crítica. Considera que la pereza no es un defecto moral, sino una forma de desobediencia que permite escapar del ritmo acelerado y competitivo del capitalismo tardío. Según él, cuando la sociedad impone la actividad constante, detenerse se convierte en un gesto de rebeldía y amor: una forma de descolonizar el tiempo y darse permiso para existir fuera de la utilidad.

Tras un proceso judicial, el desahucio fue suspendido en febrero de 2024 al determinarse la vulnerabilidad de la arrendataria.

Profesionales sanitarios de centros como el Hospital Clínico San Carlos, La Princesa, el 12 de Octubre, La Paz o el Gregorio Marañón relatan escenas de hacinamiento, esperas de más de seis horas para ser atendidos y pacientes que aguardan hasta 24 horas para conseguir una cama. En algunos casos, se han tenido que sustituir las sillas de las salas de espera por camas improvisadas, sin poder garantizar el aislamiento necesario para evitar contagios.

Los testimonios recogidos describen ratios de hasta 15 pacientes por enfermera, salas que duplican su capacidad y situaciones especialmente graves, como pacientes oncológicos en observación sin médico asignado.

El fallo se produjo cuando su hija, ahora mayor de edad, confesó durante el juicio oral que su declaración original había sido falsa y que fue inducida a mentir por su madre y su abuela materna. La denuncia, presentada en 2018 por la entonces pareja de Godoy, sostenía que los abusos ocurrieron cuando la niña tenía entre siete y diez años. En aquella época, el acusado obtuvo una exención de prisión, aunque su vida personal y profesional se vio afectada durante el extenso proceso judicial. Inicialmente, la Cámara de Apelaciones había considerado que no existían pruebas sólidas y dispuso el sobreseimiento, pero el Tribunal de Casación ordenó continuar con la causa hasta juicio oral. En el reciente debate, la hija declaró públicamente que su testimonio en Cámara Gesell no fue veraz, explicando las presiones familiares]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-ingeniero-de-la-plata-es-absuelto-tras-siete-anos-al-demostrarse-que-la-acusacion-de-abuso-fue-falsa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-ingeniero-de-la-plata-es-absuelto-tras-siete-anos-al-demostrarse-que-la-acusacion-de-abuso-fue-falsa</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 21:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Una jueza de la Corte Penal Internacional denuncia el impacto personal y judicial de las sanciones impuestas por Estados Unidos]]></title><description><![CDATA[La jueza peruana Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza, magistrada de la Corte Penal Internacional (CPI) desde hace ocho años, relata a BBC Mundo las graves consecuencias personales e institucionales derivadas de las sanciones impuestas por Estados Unidos contra ella y otros jueces y fiscales del tribunal. Washington justificó estas medidas alegando una supuesta extralimitación y politización de la CPI, especialmente tras autorizar investigaciones sobre crímenes cometidos en Afganistán y emitir órdenes de arresto relacionadas con el conflicto de Gaza.

Ibáñez explica que las sanciones no se limitan a la retirada del visado estadounidense, sino que incluyen restricciones económicas severas: bloqueo de cuentas en dólares, cancelación de tarjetas de crédito, imposibilidad de usar servicios internacionales y obstáculos para enviar dinero a su familia en Perú. Estas medidas también afectan a familiares y personas cercanas, generando una presión personal y emocional considerable.

Según el autor, la empresa utiliza la publicidad para promover una visión edulcorada de la reconciliación nacional, similar a la de la Transición española, en un envoltorio aparentemente emocional y festivo. Martínez Pereda acusa a Campofrío de apropiarse de problemas culturales y políticos reales —como la polarización social— para transformarlos en un relato comercial con connotaciones patrióticas y nostálgicas. El texto denuncia que esta estrategia convierte cuestiones históricas complejas en productos publicitarios fácilmente consumibles, despojados de conflicto o análisis crítico.

Esta aplicación se ha instalado automáticamente tras una actualización de software y no puede desinstalarse, algo que ha generado una fuerte reacción negativa. Aunque el icono puede ocultarse, la aplicación permanece activa en el sistema, lo que muchos consideran una pérdida clara de control sobre un dispositivo que han comprado.

El caso se enmarca en una tendencia más amplia del sector tecnológico: fabricantes y grandes plataformas añaden funciones, servicios o accesos directos sin el consentimiento explícito del usuario. En este caso, LG y Microsoft materializan una colaboración anunciada previamente en el CES 2025, donde se presentó la estrategia de 'AI TV' de LG, con Copilot como asistente capaz de responder preguntas y recomendar contenidos.

Entre las acusaciones destacan presiones físicas, comentarios vejatorios, espionaje interno y propuestas de favores sexuales a cambio de información o beneficios políticos. Algunos jóvenes llegaron a requerir tratamiento psiquiátrico por las consecuencias psicológicas del acoso sufrido.

La decisión se fundamenta en una combinación de factores económicos y geopolíticos: una caída sostenida de la demanda en mercados clave como China y Europa, el impacto de las tensiones comerciales internacionales, y la necesidad de adaptar su capacidad productiva al contexto actual del sector. El mercado chino, históricamente un motor de crecimiento para Volkswagen, ha reducido su ritmo debido a una mayor competencia local y a la ralentización económica. A ello se suman los aranceles impuestos por Estados Unidos, que han encarecido la exportación de vehículos y forzado una revisión profunda de la estrategia global del grupo.

La iniciativa se produce tras el anuncio de la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER) de mantener a Israel en la competición, lo que ha generado un fuerte rechazo en Portugal y otros países europeos. Salvador Sobral, ganador de Eurovisión 2017, ha sido una de las voces más destacadas del movimiento, pidiendo a la cadena pública RTP que retire la participación portuguesa como gesto de coherencia moral y política. Sobral considera que, al permitir la presencia de Israel, el festival se hace cómplice de un genocidio contra el pueblo palestino y refleja una doble moral por parte de la organización.

En ese acto, Ayuso se preguntó cómo se les puede explicar a los jóvenes que deben 'trabajar fuerte' cuando el PP llegue al Gobierno de España, una afirmación que fue interpretada por muchos como un reproche implícito a la actitud laboral de la juventud.

Las palabras de Ayuso no tardaron en viralizarse en redes sociales, donde numerosos usuarios las resumieron con ironía como un aviso de lo que vendría en caso de un cambio de Gobierno. Comentarios sarcásticos, memes y críticas inundaron plataformas como X (antes Twitter), cuestionando si la dirigente popular estaba sugiriendo que los jóvenes no se esfuerzan lo suficiente o si, por el contrario, estaba preparando el terreno para políticas laborales más duras.

Su frase más citada, 'Al ladrón no lo votéis, aunque tenga la hoz y el martillo', pretende recordar que la honestidad y la coherencia deben estar por encima de las etiquetas partidistas. 

Julio Anguita González (1941–2020) fue uno de los líderes más influyentes de la izquierda española en las décadas de 1980 y 1990.

Estos sistemas se basan en principios de termodinámica y diseño bioclimático, utilizando materiales locales como el adobe y recursos naturales como la sombra, la ventilación y el enfriamiento radiativo para conservar alimentos y mantener bajas temperaturas.

La investigación, que analizó proyecciones en 80 países con baja fecundidad, señala que en 13 de ellos —principalmente de Europa oriental y sudoriental, como Bulgaria, Letonia, Rumanía y Hungría— la reducción de la mortalidad tendría un efecto mucho más significativo que un aumento de la natalidad. Según las estimaciones, si estos países no toman ninguna medida, perderían unos 33,8 millones de habitantes de aquí a 2050.

Según el texto de la demanda, de 33 páginas, el exmandatario acusa a la cadena pública británica de editar de forma intencional e incorrecta su discurso del 6 de enero de 2021, combinando fragmentos distintos de su intervención para alterar su significado. Trump sostiene que este montaje fue deliberado y formaba parte de un intento por influir en las elecciones presidenciales de EE. UU. de 2024. 

La BBC ya había ofrecido el mes anterior una disculpa pública por el fallo en la edición de dicho discurso, aunque negó haber difamado a Trump. Samir Shah, presidente de la corporación, calificó el error de “falta de criterio” y, tras el incidente, tanto el director general de la BBC como el jefe de informativos presentaron su dimisión.

En total, el rey regularizó más de cinco millones de euros mediante dos pagos al fisco, realizados antes de una notificación formal de acusación, lo que permitió acogerse al artículo 305.4 del Código Penal y considerar su situación “regularizada”.

Posteriormente, la noticia del asesinato del director de cine Rob Reiner y su esposa por su hijo recibió una respuesta igualmente polémica, en la que el presidente ridiculizó indirectamente al fallecido, generando críticas sobre su falta de empatía y moralidad. Senserrich destaca que este comportamiento refleja un patrón de cinismo y ausencia de filtro ético, distinto al de anteriores presidentes que aunque tuviesen defectos, solían mantener cierta prudencia pública.

El objetivo de esta fórmula sería permitir la entrada de vehículos chinos sin penalizaciones arancelarias adicionales, pero estableciendo un suelo de precios que proteja a los fabricantes europeos frente a una competencia considerada desleal.

El origen del conflicto se remonta a octubre de 2024, cuando la UE aprobó aranceles de hasta el 45,3% tras una investigación de la Comisión Europea que concluía que los fabricantes chinos se beneficiaban de subvenciones públicas que distorsionaban el mercado. Según Bruselas, estas ayudas podían generar un exceso de oferta y poner en riesgo a la industria automovilística europea.

La desigualdad es especialmente marcada en empresas como Prosegur, Inditex y CIE Automotive, donde las diferencias superan las 300 veces. Aunque las grandes corporaciones pagan de media un 63% más que la media nacional, en su interior las distancias entre los salarios más altos y los más bajos son mucho más significativas.

La gran mayoría de los bosques modernos son cultivos planificados, con predominancia de pinos por su rápido crecimiento y resistencia, aunque también se han plantado otras especies como secuoyas, robles americanos o ginkgos. Este proceso ha respondido a necesidades económicas, culturales y de gestión del territorio, y ha generado bosques con valor estético y social recientes.

Destacan la condena del fiscal general por filtración de información, dimisiones de presidentes y alcaldes de PP y PSOE por corrupción y acoso sexual, encarcelamientos de exministros y tramas de corrupción investigadas por la Guardia Civil. Además, la gestión pública y sanitaria de algunas comunidades autónomas ha sido cuestionada por intereses privados y privatizaciones. La justicia, a veces, actúa favoreciendo a ciertos sectores políticos, mientras que el acoso hacia las mujeres refleja persistentes estructuras patriarcales. El bipartidismo tradicional ha perdido peso, pero los partidos que lo sustentan siguen dominando el poder, evidenciando la dependencia del Estado y sus estructuras corruptas. La dificultad para formar mayorías parlamentarias estables limita la capacidad de acción del gobierno, mientras q]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/crisis-politica-corrupcion-y-movilizacion-social-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/crisis-politica-corrupcion-y-movilizacion-social-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 05:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mediaset elimina temporalmente un debate sobre polarización en ‘El programa de Ana Rosa’ y lo repone tras el revuelo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mediaset se ha visto envuelta en la polémica tras eliminar de su plataforma Mediaset Infinity un fragmento de seis minutos correspondiente a la emisión de ‘El programa de Ana Rosa’ del lunes 15 de diciembre. El corte coincidía exactamente con un debate en plató sobre la polarización política en España, en el que Máximo Huerta acusó directamente a Ana Rosa Quintana de contribuir a esa polarización a través de sus editoriales y análisis diarios.

El momento suprimido se producía después de un reportaje basado en un estudio de El País que señalaba que un 14 % de los españoles ha roto relaciones personales en el último año por discusiones políticas, una situación que se intensifica durante las reuniones familiares navideñas. Tras la pieza, el copresentador Jano Mecha apuntó que la polarización era evidente incluso entre los colaboradores del programa, lo que dio pie a la intervención de Huerta, que señaló a Quintana como la principal responsable de ese clima en el plató.

La decisión se basa en que el mensaje enviado por Sánchez al entonces presidente de la Generalitat, Carlos Mazón, a las 22:50 horas del 29 de octubre de 2024, se produjo mucho después de los momentos críticos de la emergencia, cuando ya se había enviado el aviso Es-Alert a los móviles de la ciudadanía y la mayoría de las 230 víctimas mortales ya había fallecido. Según la magistrada, la prueba pretendía un análisis a posteriori y no se ajusta al objeto de la investigación. Además, no consta que Sánchez, a diferencia de Alberto Núñez Feijóo, estuviera informado en tiempo real por Mazón sobre la evolución del temporal. Por otro lado, la jueza ha citado a Feijóo para que explique sus conversaciones con Mazón y le ha ofrecido la posibilidad de presentar sus registros de llamadas y mensajes del día del temporal.

El pesticida, fabricado por Syngenta (subsidiaria de una empresa estatal china) y anteriormente distribuido por Chevron, se utiliza en cultivos de algodón, soja y maíz por su eficacia al eliminar malas hierbas, pero su toxicidad ha generado miles de demandas judiciales. Ex trabajadores agrícolas, como Paul Friday en Míchigan o Jim Krause en California, afirman que el contacto prolongado con el químico dañó sus células nerviosas y desencadenó su enfermedad. Más de 6.000 casos judiciales están acumulados en los tribunales estadounidenses, y aunque Syngenta niega que exista una relación causal entre el paraquat y el párkinson, investigaciones científicas señalan un aumento del riesgo de contraer la enfermedad entre quienes viven o tra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-herbicida-paraquat-en-ee-uu-se-vincula-con-un-aumento-de-casos-de-parkinson-entre-agricultores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-uso-del-herbicida-paraquat-en-ee-uu-se-vincula-con-un-aumento-de-casos-de-parkinson-entre-agricultores</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 03:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Cuenca completa la retirada de símbolos franquistas pendientes desde 2018]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Cuenca ha culminado la retirada de más de medio centenar de placas con simbología franquista de diferentes fachadas de la ciudad, poniendo fin a un largo proceso iniciado hace más de una década. Esta actuación da cumplimiento a la Ley de Memoria Democrática y a un acuerdo plenario aprobado en 2018 que establecía la eliminación de los símbolos vinculados a la dictadura franquista. El acuerdo, promovido entonces por Izquierda Unida, PSOE y Ciudadanos —y aprobado pese al voto en contra del Partido Popular—, fijaba un plazo para la retirada de las cerca de 140 placas identificadas, permitiendo la ejecución subsidiaria en caso de incumplimiento. 

Tras varios años de retraso, el actual equipo de gobierno socialista, encabezado por el alcalde Darío Dolz, ha contratado a una empresa para completar la supresión de estos elementos.

A pesar de que sus denuncias fueron archivadas, Serrano se enfrenta actualmente a un juicio militar por presunta denuncia falsa. La Fiscalía no aprecia indicios de delito y, por ello, no ejercerá la acusación. No obstante, existe una acusación particular presentada por el general Fernando Mora Moret, exjefe de la Comandancia de Sevilla, que solicita más de un año de prisión para la suboficial. Durante la vista celebrada en el Tribunal Militar Territorial Primero de Madrid, se declaró la acusada junto al denunciante y dos testigos, quienes no confirmaron que la denuncia inicial de Serrano fuera falsa.

La decisión, tomada en una vista a puerta cerrada, responde a una petición de la Fiscalía General rusa presentada en noviembre de 2025. Según las autoridades, el colectivo supone una amenaza a la seguridad del Estado, acusación que sus miembros y abogados califican como infundada y motivada políticamente. Pussy Riot, conocidas por su activismo feminista y sus críticas al Kremlin, se convirtieron en símbolo de la oposición política y artística al presidente Vladímir Putin desde su célebre “oración punk” en 2012 dentro de la catedral de Cristo Salvador de Moscú, acto por el que dos de sus integrantes fueron encarceladas. En los últimos años, el grupo ha denunciado la guerra en Ucrania y ha sufrido diversos procesos judiciales en Rusia.

En el primer caso, el presidente minimizó la tragedia —que dejó dos muertos y nueve heridos— con un comentario que transmitía indiferencia ante la violencia armada que asola al país. En el segundo, tras conocerse el asesinato de Reiner, Trump publicó un mensaje que ridiculizaba al fallecido y hacía burla de su postura crítica hacia él, llegando incluso a referirse a él como un “hombre enfermo” afectado por un supuesto “síndrome de demencia trumpiana”.

China ocupa el primer puesto en 66 de ellas, destacando en áreas como la energía nuclear, la biología sintética y los pequeños satélites. Por su parte, Estados Unidos lidera en las ocho restantes, entre las que se encuentran la computación cuántica y la geoingeniería.

El Gobierno regional, presidido por Isabel Díaz Ayuso, justifica este aumento por el crecimiento demográfico —en torno a 100.000 habitantes nuevos al año— y la necesidad de reforzar servicios públicos esenciales. Sanidad absorberá cerca del 36 % del gasto total, con 550 millones más destinados a modernizar hospitales como La Paz o el Gregorio Marañón, y a atender el incremento de recetas médicas, que sube un 17 %. Educación también experimenta una subida de 259 millones y Familia, Juventud y Asuntos Sociales, de 210 millones adicionales. En cambio, Cultura, Turismo y Deporte bajan un 0,8 %, alcanzando los 300,1 millones, lo que representa el segundo recorte consecutivo.

Según las autoridades ucranianas, la embarcación, equipada con lanzadores de misiles de crucero Kalibr utilizados frecuentemente por Rusia para atacar infraestructuras y objetivos civiles en Ucrania, sufrió daños críticos que la dejaron fuera de servicio. El SBU destacó que el operativo fue llevado a cabo en coordinación con el 13º Directorado Principal de Contrainteligencia Militar y la Armada ucraniana.

Tras el éxito de Deliverance, Boorman gozó de libertad creativa, escribiendo el guion junto a Bill Stair e inspirándose en T. S. Eliot, leyendas artúricas y autores de ciencia ficción como Jack Vance. La historia transcurre en 2293, en una Tierra postapocalíptica donde conviven los Eternos, inmortales en un paraje idílico, y los Brutales, habitantes de las Tierras Exteriores. Zed, interpretado por Sean Connery, es un Exterminador que penetra en el Vórtice y desestabiliza la paz de los Eternos, explorando temas como eugenesia, libertad versus seguridad, intelectualismo frente a barbarie y religiosidad. El rodaje se realizó en la campiña irlandesa con un presupuesto de poco más de un millón de dólares, destacando la implicación de Connery y la participación de Charlotte Rampling.

Con un tono nostálgico, Boinker invita a veteranos y nuevos jugadores a reunirse en torno a las mesas de títulos emblemáticos de la época, como El Señor de los Anillos (MERP/Rolemaster), La Llamada de Cthulhu, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2ª Edición, Aquelarre, Star Wars D6, RuneQuest y Stormbringer. Su propuesta busca devolver la esencia del rol presencial, con primeras partidas previstas en A Coruña y Madrid, aunque también se contempla la posibilidad de organizar sesiones online para quienes vivan fuera de esas ciudades. La iniciativa ha despertado entusiasmo entre lectores y seguidores del blog, que han compartido en comentarios sus recuerdos de aquellos años y su interés por participar, incluso a distancia.

Según relata, los propietarios del edificio intentan forzar su salida mediante obras ruidosas, cortes de luz y una convivencia insoportable con las reformas constantes que buscan transformar el inmueble en varios microapartamentos para turistas. María es una de las tres últimas inquilinas con contrato de renta antigua que quedan en su bloque, y asegura que no se marchará porque no tiene a dónde ir. Su hija, que vive con ella, denuncia un acoso continuado y la desaparición de la vida vecinal que antes caracterizaba a la Gran Vía. La concejala de Más Madrid, Lucía Lois, ha denunciado públicamente el caso, asegurando que el Ayuntamiento permite prácticas abusivas amparadas por un modelo urbano cada vez más enfocado al turismo y la rentabilidad inmediata.

La subvención autonómica ha pasado de 250.000 euros hace dos años a solo 12.000 en la última convocatoria, una reducción del 95%. El Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso justifica el cambio por un nuevo modelo de financiación basado en proyectos concretos y no en ayudas nominativas. Sin embargo, Hernández León considera que esta decisión responde a una forma de censura cultural y a una represalia por las actividades críticas que el CBA ha albergado, como exposiciones sobre Gaza, actos relacionados con la memoria histórica o el apoyo al arte comprometido.

Según el texto, la derecha habría adoptado desde hace décadas tácticas mediáticas y judiciales para debilitar a los gobiernos progresistas cuando no logra imponerse en las urnas. La pieza sugiere que parte de la judicatura y de ciertos medios de comunicación estarían actuando de forma coordinada para desprestigiar a figuras del Gobierno. En concreto, el artículo menciona el caso del Fiscal General del Estado, Álvaro Ortiz, cuya reciente condena por revelación de secretos es calificada como injusta y políticamente motivada.

Según el Juzgado de Instrucción nº5 de la localidad, existen indicios suficientes para continuar la investigación sobre la contratación de una mujer, identificada como C.P., como personal eventual del Ayuntamiento entre febrero y marzo de 2023. Durante ese periodo, los informes judiciales y de recursos humanos reflejan que no consta registro de actividad, control horario ni evidencias de que realizara funciones laborales. En paralelo, se acreditó que el alcalde mantenía una relación personal e íntima con ella y que previamente le había transferido 21.000 euros en un año para ayudarla económicamente.

Las autoridades sanitarias subrayan que la situación está controlada y que se han aplicado desde el primer momento los protocolos establecidos para este tipo de episodios.

Tras la detección de los primeros casos, se activaron medidas preventivas e inspecciones en el centro universitario, con el objetivo de identificar el origen del brote y evitar su propagación.

También se reportó que uno de ellos sufría cataratas y dificultad para caminar. Las imágenes, compartidas en redes sociales, han reavivado el debate sobre el uso de animales en festejos públicos.

El Ayuntamiento de El Escorial ha respondido afirmando que la actividad se realizó conforme a la normativa vigente de bienestar y sanidad animal, con supervisión veterinaria y todas las autorizaciones requeridas. En su comunicado, sostiene que la pérdida de pelo y cuernos observada es un proceso natural de los renos y niega cualquier tipo de maltrato.

El autor sostiene que el poder estadounidense, fundado tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial en bases económicas, tecnológicas, militares y culturales, ha entrado en una fase de degradación estructural. Aunque el país mantiene su supremacía militar, su peso económico global se ha reducido drásticamente: el PIB ha pasado de representar el 40 % del mundial en 1960 al 29,2 % en 2024, la producción industrial del 40 % al 19 %, y el comercio internacional del 30 % al 10 %. Paralelamente, el autor destaca cómo el deterioro doméstico refleja rasgos propios de economías subdesarrolladas: aumento de la desigualdad, deterioro de infraestructuras y precarización de la vida laboral.

Arteuparte cerró en 2023 tras más de una década de existencia, pero resurgió en 2024 bajo el sello de Jot Down, simbolizando la capacidad de transformación de estas iniciativas. Revista Mercurio también vivió sucesivos cierres y renacimientos desde su fundación en 1999, adaptándose a nuevas realidades editoriales y a modelos de financiación cooperativos. Fernández subraya que la supervivencia de estas publicaciones no responde a razones económicas, sino a un compromiso ético y cultural de editores y colaboradores.

Hoy, tras acumular deuda, su valor se reduce a 140 millones y pasa a manos de Picea. Este fenómeno no se limita a las aspiradoras: marcas como Volvo, Motorola, Segway, IBM PC y GE Appliances también han terminado bajo propiedad china. Europa ha intentado frenar algunas adquisiciones, como la compra de iRobot por Amazon, pero estas medidas han tenido resultados contraproducentes, ya que la tecnología termina igualmente en manos chinas.

En una entrevista desde su actual cargo como embajadora ante la Organización de Estados Americanos, Montón repasa las consecuencias de esta fórmula de gestión, impulsada en 1999 por el gobierno del PP de Eduardo Zaplana. El modelo consistía en ceder la gestión de hospitales públicos a empresas privadas bajo un sistema de pago por cápita, con el supuesto objetivo de mejorar la eficiencia y reducir costes. Según Montón, estas concesiones se demostraron insostenibles sin una dependencia de los recursos públicos, provocando sobrecostes, falta de transparencia y menores condiciones laborales.

A partir de este recuerdo, el autor reflexiona sobre la figura del realizador de 'Grupo salvaje', su etapa de decadencia en los años ochenta, su carácter violento y vitalista y la profunda humanidad que latía bajo su fama de alcohólico y rebelde. Trueba compara su trayectoria con la de Martin Scorsese, a quien la serie documental 'Mr. Scorsese' (2025) presenta como otro artista marcado por la autodestrucción, la genialidad y la necesidad de redención.

Este episodio, habitual en los meses de invierno, ha empeorado por la humedad, los vientos débiles y las emisiones de tráfico, industria y quema de rastrojos en zonas agrícolas.

A través de imágenes de archivo, la película muestra cómo George H. W. Bush, pese a prometer combatir el calentamiento global durante su campaña y al inicio de su presidencia, terminó cediendo ante los intereses de la industria petrolera y las presiones económicas internas. Nombró como administrador de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental a William K. Reilly, un conservacionista, pero permitió que su jefe de gabinete, John Sununu, limitara cualquier intento de regulación ecológica. El desastre del petrolero Exxon Valdez en Alaska en 1989 simbolizó una oportunidad perdida para cambiar el rumbo energético de EE. UU., que en lugar de reducir el consumo de combustibles fósiles, lo incrementó.

Este abono, con un precio de 60 euros al mes —y de 30 euros para menores de 26 años—, permitirá viajar en trenes de media distancia, servicios de Cercanías y autobuses estatales. La medida forma parte de una estrategia más amplia para fomentar la movilidad sostenible y aliviar los gastos de transporte de las familias trabajadoras y la clase media. El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sánchez, ha destacado que el nuevo título contribuirá a reducir el uso del vehículo privado, disminuir las emisiones y hacer más accesible el transporte público para todos los ciudadanos.

El abono estará disponible a partir de la segunda quincena de enero de 2026 y su implementación inicial cubrirá los servicios gestionados por el Estado. No obstante, el Ejecutivo ha invitado a comunidades autónomas y ayuntamientos a sumarse a la iniciativa, integrando sus redes de metro, autobuses urba]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-lanza-un-abono-unico-nacional-de-transporte-de-60-euros-mensuales-para-trenes-y-autobuses</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-lanza-un-abono-unico-nacional-de-transporte-de-60-euros-mensuales-para-trenes-y-autobuses</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenida en Alcossebre una mujer reclamada por Países Bajos por delitos de trata y explotación de menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Guardia Civil ha detenido en Alcossebre (Castellón) a una mujer sobre la que pesaba una Orden Europea de Detención emitida por las autoridades de los Países Bajos. La mujer estaba reclamada por delitos de especial gravedad, entre ellos trata de seres humanos, explotación sexual de menores, secuestro, tenencia de material pedófilo, tráfico de drogas y abandono de menores. El operativo permitió rescatar a cuatro menores que se encontraban bajo su cuidado y que ahora permanecen en un centro de acogida en buen estado. La investigación comenzó el 7 de diciembre, cuando la Policía Local de Alcalà de Xivert encontró a dos jóvenes, de 13 y 17 años, que aseguraron haber sido abandonados por la detenida, quien siguió su viaje con otros dos menores.

Según documentos y comunicaciones internas a los que ha tenido acceso La Razón, la cúpula de Vox buscaba controlar directamente Revuelta y apropiarse de los fondos recaudados por la asociación. El conflicto se centra en la gestión de los 'cientos de miles' de euros que la organización recaudó para ayudar a afectados por las riadas en la Comunidad Valenciana, dinero que, según Vox, no fue distribuido correctamente. La disputa se intensificó tras una cena el 19 de marzo, en la que Kiko Méndez-Monasterio, cercano a Santiago Abascal, dejó claro que el partido debía asumir el control de Revuelta, argumentando que la asociación era un proyecto financiado por Vox y que no podía operar de manera independiente.

En el texto, Vox sostiene que diversos colectivos antifascistas protagonizan una escalada de violencia contra actos y militantes de su partido y contra otros rivales ideológicos. Como respaldo a esta tesis, la proposición enumera incidentes ocurridos en diferentes ciudades, como Madrid, Bilbao, Catalunya, Castelló, Gasteiz o Sevilla, además de supuestas agresiones a agentes policiales durante la Vuelta Ciclista a España y a un periodista en Iruñea en octubre.

De niño, su talento para el baile y la actuación le abrió las puertas del cine, participando en varias películas, incluida 'El hijo de Frankenstein' (1939). Sin embargo, su papel más emblemático fue en la película animada de Walt Disney 'Bambi', donde sirvió de modelo y voz para el joven cervatillo. A pesar del éxito, su carrera cinematográfica terminó con el estallido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y los problemas familiares que lo llevaron a un orfanato. A los 18 años se alistó en la Infantería de Marina, participó en la guerra de Vietnam y fue herido en combate varias veces, recibiendo tres Corazones Púrpura y una Estrella de Bronce.

Miembro veterano de ETA desde los años 60, fue considerado uno de los terroristas más duros de la organización, especialmente en los años 70 y 80. Se le atribuye la autoría del secuestro, tortura y asesinato en 1973 de tres jóvenes gallegos —José Humberto Fouz, Jorge Juan García y Fernando Quiroga— tras ser confundidos con policías. El exagente infiltrado Mikel Lejarza, 'El Lobo', relató que Peixoto llegó a presumir de haber torturado personalmente a las víctimas. Posteriormente, tras sufrir un atentado del Batallón Vasco Español en 1979, su papel dentro de ETA pasó a ser más logístico, centrado en el cobro del 'impuesto revolucionario' a empresarios vascos.

Durante los años 80, Peixoto fue dirigente de ETA y de Herri Batasuna, defendiendo posturas ideológicas que justificaban la violencia, incluido el asesinato de la exetarra Yoyes.

Aunque ha existido debate sobre la causalidad, un estudio publicado en 'Science Advances' analizó 109 países durante el siglo XX y concluyó que, en aproximadamente el 90% de los casos, la secularización precede al crecimiento económico, más que al revés. Además, la investigación destaca que la protección de derechos individuales —incluyendo el derecho al aborto, al divorcio y la aceptación de la diversidad sexual— también contribuye a una mayor probabilidad de prosperidad.

El canciller alemán Friedrich Merz la calificó de 'inaceptable', mientras que el primer ministro polaco Donald Tusk recordó que ambos aliados se enfrentan a los mismos enemigos, en referencia a Rusia.

Ibáñez critica duramente estas memorias, calificándolas de 'vendetta personal' contra los actuales Reyes, de exaltación de Francisco Franco y de humillación hacia las víctimas de la dictadura. Según el diputado, el libro refleja una búsqueda de protagonismo y supone un error que debilita el legado del monarca emérito, además de justificar aspectos controvertidos de su vida personal y su papel en negocios privados.

Este equipo técnico centralizaba la revisión de ofertas de proveedores y aprobaba los contratos siguiendo las directrices de la Unión Europea, en un contexto en el que la situación sanitaria provocada por el Covid-19 obligó a acelerar los procedimientos administrativos y pasar por alto algunos controles. Según la investigación judicial, entre 2021 y 2023 Leire Díez, junto con el expresidente de la SEPI Vicente Fernández y el empresario Antxón Alonso, habría participado en la adjudicación irregular de al menos cinco contratos por valor de casi 133 millones de euros, obteniendo comisiones.

La sanción, que es firme y agota la vía administrativa tras resolverse el recurso de alzada, incluye además la obligación de eliminar los contenidos ilícitos y hacer pública la penalización. Según el Ministerio que dirige Pablo Bustinduy, se han identificado 65.122 anuncios que incumplían la normativa de consumo, lo que constituye prácticas comerciales desleales hacia los usuarios. Estas infracciones incluyen anuncios sin número de registro, con licencias falsas o incorrectas, y casos en los que no se informaba adecuadamente sobre la condición jurídica de los anfitriones, incurriendo en publicidad engañosa.

El caso investiga una supuesta red de corrupción vinculada a la concesión de licencias para parques eólicos en Castilla y León entre los años 2000 y 2015. Según la Fiscalía y varios testigos, las empresas interesadas en obtener autorizaciones se veían obligadas a incluir en sus sociedades a compañías 'locales' vinculadas a altos cargos de la Junta, o de lo contrario sus solicitudes quedaban paralizadas. Estas sociedades, en connivencia con la Consejería de Economía, obtenían beneficios ilícitos a través de la compraventa inflada de participaciones.

Los hechos, según su testimonio, se produjeron entre los 13 y los 15 años e incluyeron tocamientos, abusos reiterados y una relación de control psicológico y espiritual prolongada en el tiempo.

La decisión de denunciar se desencadenó tras una llamada recibida en noviembre de 2024 por parte del propio sacerdote, en la que este le trasladó que responsables del Opus Dei le habían preguntado si pensaba denunciar. Para Merino, ese contacto fue determinante para tomar conciencia del control que el agresor había ejercido durante décadas y dar el paso de contar públicamente lo ocurrido. Tras un año de reflexión, presentó denuncia en el juzgado de Instrucción de Pamplona y anunció que también acudirá al Defensor del Pueblo.

Las autoridades australianas confirmaron que los autores fueron un padre de 50 años y su hijo de 24, a quienes se investiga por motivos antisemitas y terroristas. El padre murió en el mismo lugar tras ser abatido por la policía, mientras que el hijo resultó herido de gravedad. Entre las víctimas hay un ciudadano israelí y un rabino británico. El suceso, que duró unos diez minutos, provocó el pánico entre los asistentes, que huyeron hacia las calles y parques cercanos. Un transeúnte, identificado como Ahmed al Ahmed, logró desarmar a uno de los atacantes y fue reconocido como héroe por las autoridades.

Esta operación ha generado alarma entre expertos en ciberseguridad e inteligencia, ya que la dirección de Kiteworks incluye a varios antiguos miembros de la unidad de inteligencia israelí 8200. La adquisición implica que los datos de ciudadanos europeos pasan a estar bajo jurisdicción estadounidense, lo que abre la puerta a posibles accesos por parte de las autoridades de EE. UU. o a vulnerabilidades relacionadas con la seguridad.

Investigaciones de Follow the Money indican que, contrariamente a lo que afirma Zivver, los mensajes enviados mediante su plataforma pueden ser leídos por la propia compañía antes de ser cifrados completamente. Esto afecta a comunicaciones especialmente sensibles, como expedientes judiciales, información médica o datos personales de inmigración. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-en-europa-por-la-venta-de-zivver-empresa-que-gestiona-datos-sensibles-a-una-firma-estadounidense-con-vinculos-con-inteligencia-israeli</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-en-europa-por-la-venta-de-zivver-empresa-que-gestiona-datos-sensibles-a-una-firma-estadounidense-con-vinculos-con-inteligencia-israeli</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 13:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Hospital Ramón y Cajal investiga contratos adjudicados a empresas vinculadas con su exresponsable de obras]]></title><description><![CDATA[Según una investigación publicada por Infobae España, el Hospital Ramón y Cajal de Madrid habría adjudicado entre 2016 y 2022 más de 10 millones de euros en 1.346 contratos públicos a dos empresas vinculadas familiarmente con su entonces subdirector de Obras y Mantenimiento, Antonio Romero-Toro. Las empresas Fornela Multiservicios y Proyectos Imifer, gestionadas por su hijo y su nieto, obtuvieron la mayoría de los contratos mediante procedimientos menores —sin publicidad ni libre concurrencia—, práctica que la legislación permite bajo ciertos importes, aunque reduce la transparencia. En total, Fornela recibió 859 contratos por un valor de 7,7 millones de euros, e Imifer otros 487 por 2,3 millones. El 70 % del importe total se adjudicó de forma directa y, en el caso de Imifer, todos los contratos fueron a dedo.

Aquella decisión de Mao Zedong de eliminar a los gorriones, considerados plaga, desencadenó una oleada de insectos y langostas que devastó las cosechas, causando una gran hambruna. El texto enlaza este hecho histórico con la situación actual del planeta: la drástica reducción de aves en todo el mundo, causada principalmente por la modificación del uso del suelo —urbanización, deforestación y agricultura intensiva—. En España, datos recientes de SEO/BirdLife muestran que el 43 % de las especies primaverales y más de la mitad de las nocturnas están en declive, con una pérdida notable incluso en especies comunes como el gorrión.

La decisión se adopta como medida cautelar tras una denuncia presentada por la Fiscalía de Barcelona, que considera que los vídeos del joven constituyen un delito de incitación al odio.

Aquella afirmación se basaba en datos provisionales de los presupuestos iniciales de las comunidades autónomas, una circunstancia que ya se advertía en la propia nota metodológica del ministerio.

Tras la revisión de la información, motivada en parte por la incorporación de los nuevos presupuestos sanitarios de la Comunitat Valenciana —que hasta entonces operaba con cuentas prorrogadas—, el promedio nacional ha aumentado hasta los 1.769 euros por habitante.

Mientras Petro adoptó una postura crítica y directa, otros líderes latinoamericanos mostraron enfoques más diplomáticos: el presidente Lula da Silva deseó éxito a Kast y el presidente argentino Javier Milei lo felicitó, resaltando la defensa de la vida y la libertad. Kast, devoto católico y padre de nueve hijos, prometió deportar a migrantes irregulares y enfrentar la criminalidad, enfatizando que Chile se encuentra en crisis.

El diminuto anfibio, de un intenso color anaranjado, habita exclusivamente en una estrecha franja de bosque nuboso de la Sierra de Quiriri, en el estado de Santa Catarina, a más de 750 metros sobre el nivel del mar. Esta localización tan específica y su comportamiento esquivo entre la hojarasca explican que haya pasado desapercibido hasta ahora. Los investigadores lo descubrieron gracias al particular canto de apareamiento que emiten los machos, aunque localizar a las hembras resultó más complejo.
