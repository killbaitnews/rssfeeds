This oversupply comes despite efforts by major oil producers to slow down production increases. The IEA attributes the growing surplus to slower-than-expected demand growth for oil worldwide, particularly in relation to electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources. The agency's updated energy outlook includes a scenario predicting ongoing oil demand growth until 2050, despite criticisms that it underestimates the rise of EV adoption, especially in developing nations. Additionally, the IEA's report highlights the rapid expansion of renewable energy, projecting more renewable energy projects will be built in the next five years than in the previous 40 years. As climate discussions continue, the IEA's outlook is a reminder that fossil fuel dependence may not last as long as previously anticipated, with renewable energy set to overtak]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/global-oil-supply-could-exceed-demand-by-4-million-barrels-per-day-by-2026-warns-iea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/global-oil-supply-could-exceed-demand-by-4-million-barrels-per-day-by-2026-warns-iea</guid><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 00:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's Strategy for Reducing N2O Emissions and Addressing Climate Change]]></title><description><![CDATA[China has been making significant strides in reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential nearly 300 times that of CO2. Since 2013, the country has successfully curbed the growth of anthropogenic N2O emissions through a combination of pollution control policies and climate action initiatives. N2O is mainly produced by agricultural activities, but industrial emissions also contribute significantly. Although historically, developed countries have been the biggest emitters, recent increases have been observed in emerging economies in Asia, including China. China's success in tackling this issue is largely attributed to its 'synergistic governance' approach, which integrates pollution control with economic development goals. A key part of this strategy includes the widespread adoption of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology in coal-fired power plants, which has helped reduce N2O emissions by up to 90%. Additionally, China has introduced]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-strategy-for-reducing-n2o-emissions-and-addressing-climate-change</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-s-strategy-for-reducing-n2o-emissions-and-addressing-climate-change</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Man Uses Laptop Batteries and Solar Power to Off-Grid His Home for Over 8 Years]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since 2016, Glubux, a self-reliant hobbyist, has been powering his home entirely off the grid using an inventive system built from laptop batteries and solar panels. His journey began with 1.4 kW of solar panels, a forklift battery, and a collection of old laptop batteries. By November of that year, he had amassed 650 laptop batteries. After sorting and testing the individual cells, he built a custom battery rack that powers his home. Over time, the setup grew with the addition of 24 more solar panels and hundreds of additional laptop batteries, all charged and stored to run appliances, lights, and even weathering grid outages. The system operates seamlessly with Victron controllers and inverters, providing reliable off-grid power for more than eight years. Glubux's battery-powered home is an impressive example of sustainable living, using repurposed technology and solar energy to stay independent of the electrical grid.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-uses-laptop-batteries-and-solar-power-to-off-grid-his-home-for-over-8-years</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/man-uses-laptop-batteries-and-solar-power-to-off-grid-his-home-for-over-8-years</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Artillery Overpowers NATO's Top Weapons in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Russian military continues its advance in Ukraine, utilizing overwhelming firepower to neutralize Ukrainian military capabilities. October and November were disastrous for the Ukrainian government, with at least 10,000 soldiers lost. A key part of Russia's success is its advanced artillery and missile systems, which have evolved dramatically since the start of the conflict. Initially, the Russian military faced bureaucratic delays in getting artillery support, allowing Ukrainian forces to launch successful strikes. However, over time, Russia streamlined its processes, reducing artillery response times to mere minutes, drastically outpacing NATO's advanced weapons like the HIMARS system. Russian systems like the Iskander-M and Tornado-S have proven highly effective, destroying Ukrainian high-value targets from long distances. Meanwhile, Ukraine's attempts to develop similar systems, such as the Sapsan missile, have faced setbacks, with Russian missile strikes targeting Ukrainian pro]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-artillery-overpowers-nato-s-top-weapons-in-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/russian-artillery-overpowers-nato-s-top-weapons-in-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 14:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s 28-Point Plan for Peace in Ukraine: Territorial Concessions and Security Guarantees]]></title><description><![CDATA[President Trump's 28-point peace plan for Ukraine proposes a range of measures aimed at ending the conflict with Russia, including territorial concessions from Ukraine, limitations on its military size, and a guarantee that Ukraine will not join NATO. The plan, which has been endorsed by key U.S. officials, outlines significant political, military, and economic agreements between the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia. Key points include the recognition of Crimea, Luhansk, and Donetsk as part of Russia, with a ceasefire to be implemented after both sides retreat to agreed positions. Ukraine’s military would be capped at 600,000 personnel, and the country would not be allowed to join NATO. In exchange, Ukraine would receive security guarantees and the U.S. would provide military support in case of further Russian aggression. The plan also includes economic elements such as a large-scale reconstruction effort for Ukraine, partly funded by frozen Russian assets.

These women face some of the toughest labor conditions, working long hours with minimal breaks in small workshops subcontracted by well-known international brands like Zara, Diesel, and Levi’s. The abolition of the Multifiber Agreement in 2005 worsened the violation of their labor rights, leading to precarious work contracts and declining wages. Many workers suffer from health issues such as allergies, asthma, and musculoskeletal disorders due to poor working conditions. Despite this, the labor force remains largely passive, partly due to low levels of education and the patriarchal structure of the workplace. While Tunisia’s textile sector is critical to its economy, it is deeply embedded in the global fast fashion supply chain, which pressures workers to produce more quickly and cheaply. In response, some women have formed cooperative businesses like 'Manos Solidarias,' aimin]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-harsh-reality-of-tunisian-women-in-the-textile-industry</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-harsh-reality-of-tunisian-women-in-the-textile-industry</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 09:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Axon’s Vision for the Future of Public Security in Mexico: Insights from Alejandro Herrera]]></title><description><![CDATA[In an exclusive interview with Alejandro Herrera, Country Manager of Axon Mexico, the company shared its vision for the future of public security.

These events involved wealthy individuals paying large sums of money to join sniper units and shoot at civilians from the hills surrounding Sarajevo. The investigation was prompted by a report from Italian journalist Ezio Gavazzeni, who uncovered details of these horrifying excursions. During the Bosnian War, people, including Italian nationals, traveled to Sarajevo to join Serbian sniper units and engage in this brutal form of entertainment. The prices for such excursions ranged from 80,000 to 100,000 euros. The CIA's involvement in organizing these operations through a Serbian agent, Jovica Stanisic, has also come to light. Stanisic, who was part of Serbia's State Security Department and later convicted of war crimes, played a key role in facilitating these operations.

Tensions escalated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated that Japan would consider military intervention if China attempts to reclaim Taiwan. This move directly contradicts Japan's post-World War II pacifist stance, which renounced war through Article 9 of its constitution. The article, which prohibited offensive military actions, was partially relaxed in 2015 by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who passed the Peace and Security Law, allowing for collective self-defense. Despite protests from China and internal opposition in Japan, the country has now taken a more aggressive military stance, particularly in relation to Taiwan. Meanwhile, the United States has strengthened its military presence in Japan, with 120 bases and over 50,000 troops stationed in the country.

The meeting comes after weeks of insults from Trump, who had previously called Mamdani a 'communist lunatic' and falsely accused him of being in the country illegally. Despite their heated rhetoric, Trump praised Mamdani's campaign and stated that their meeting was productive, even suggesting they had more in common than expected. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, had earlier referred to himself as 'Trump's worst nightmare' during his campaign. The two politicians, both skilled in social media, have often used online platforms to address their bases. While the meeting was scheduled behind closed doors, the White House did not provide details but later suggested that Trump was open to engaging with anyone who would do what’s best for the American people.

The USS Stockdale, a U.S. destroyer, crossed the Seahorse's route on November 13, forcing it to change course toward Cuba. The tanker attempted to approach Venezuela twice after that but turned back each time. The ongoing U.S. naval presence in the Caribbean is seen as part of a broader strategy to limit Russia's ability to deliver fuel to Caracas, which remains heavily reliant on foreign oil despite its vast reserves. The Seahorse, along with two other sanctioned tankers, is currently idling near Venezuela. The U.S. Southern Command has declined to comment on whether the USS Stockdale made direct contact with the Russian vessel. Meanwhile, concerns have arisen over the environmental and security risks associated with these shadow tankers, which have prompted discussions in Europe ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-navy-prevents-sanctioned-russian-tanker-from-delivering-oil-to-venezuela</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-navy-prevents-sanctioned-russian-tanker-from-delivering-oil-to-venezuela</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 04:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Two men steal multiple gold coins from Lausanne-Vidy Roman Museum; investigation underway]]></title><description><![CDATA[Two intruders entered the Roman Museum of Lausanne-Vidy shortly before closing time on a Tuesday, after purchasing admission at the ticket desk. They assaulted and restrained the museum guard, then shattered a secure display case to seize several gold coins of archaeological significance. The incident prompted an alarm activation and police intervention, with the guard reported as safe and uninjured and the museum reopening the following day. A police inquiry is ongoing, led by the Lausanne Judicial Police, with the Public Prosecutor's Office having opened a criminal investigation for robbery and property damage. The exact number of stolen coins remains undetermined as an inventory is in progress. This type of burglary is described as relatively rare in Switzerland, though other high-profile art heists in Geneva, the Vallée de Joux, Zurich, and a recent parallel at the Louvre in Paris are noted for historical context.

An attorney for Ge’s family alleges he was discovered in a shower stall with a cloth ligature around his neck and bound in a hog-tied position, with wrists and ankles restrained by linens. The incident occurred at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center (MVPC) in Philipsburg after Ge was detained following a prior legal case in Dauphin County. An autopsy reportedly confirmed the binding and raised concerns about mental health care access, as the family contends Ge did not receive adequate treatment. The family has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in the Southern District of New York, seeking fuller disclosure and accountability.

This decision comes as part of a shift in the Coast Guard's guidelines, which aim to address various symbols considered divisive. The swastika, historically associated with Nazi Germany and its atrocities during World War II, was a symbol of fascism and white supremacy, linked to the deaths of millions, including six million Jews in the Holocaust. While the swastika will no longer be categorized as a hate symbol, the Coast Guard’s new policy considers it 'potentially divisive.' Similarly, symbols like the Confederate flag and nooses, which have also been sources of racial tension, will be redefined under these updated guidelines. However, the display of the Confederate flag will still be prohibited. This policy change reflects the Coast Guard’s broader approach to symbols of division, balancing the historical context with its focus on preventing divisiveness within ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/coast-guard-reclassifies-swastika-as-potentially-divisive-instead-of-hate-symbol</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/coast-guard-reclassifies-swastika-as-potentially-divisive-instead-of-hate-symbol</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan criticizes Trump’s changing stance on Epstein files and reflects on his interest in buying Epstein's island]]></title><description><![CDATA[During a recent podcast, Joe Rogan mocked former President Donald Trump for his shifting position on the Epstein files. Initially dismissing the files as a hoax, Trump changed his tune, urging House Republicans to release them. Rogan expressed confusion over Trump’s reversal, especially since the president had previously claimed no files existed. Rogan also revealed that he once considered purchasing the infamous Little Saint James island, also known as ‘Pedophile Island,’ in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The island, once owned by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, was bought by billionaire Stephen Deckoff in 2023 for $60 million. Rogan and his team briefly discussed the idea of acquiring the island, but ultimately decided against it due to the high price.

These tokens, which appeared like ordinary coins with imperial profiles or decorative motifs, were exchanged for sexual services in the luxurious brothels of the Belle Époque. The erotic engravings on the reverse side of the tokens revealed their true purpose—serving as prepaid tickets that offered discretion to both clients and madams. Clients could purchase tokens at the entrance without specifying the sexual act they desired, thus protecting their anonymity. For madams, the tokens provided an easy way to track payments and ensure fair compensation for the sex workers. This system was not a new invention; it had roots in ancient Roman times, where similar tokens known as 'spintriae' were used for the same purpose. These erotic tokens survived through history and resurfaced in Paris during Napoleon III's reign.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon emphasized the administration's goal of cutting through red tape and returning education control to the states. Critics argue that these changes could disrupt services for vulnerable students, especially those facing poverty or disabilities. The strategy involves transferring responsibilities to other agencies while retaining the Department of Education's legal authority. This move aligns with Trump's long-standing desire to eliminate the Education Department, a stance backed by conservatives who view it as ineffective. The department's restructuring also includes shifting programs related to teacher training, college prep, and English instruction, as well as foreign language and Native American education progra]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-moves-forward-with-plan-to-dismantle-the-u-s-education-department</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-administration-moves-forward-with-plan-to-dismantle-the-u-s-education-department</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mexico Partners with Barcelona to Build Largest Supercomputer in Latin America]]></title><description><![CDATA[Mexico has taken a significant step toward establishing its first continental-class supercomputer, as the federal government signed an agreement with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC).

The judge ruled that all parties involved must return to court within a week to discuss possible alternatives to imprisonment, including recommendations from the youth’s defense attorney and the probation officer handling the case. The boy’s mother has publicly condemned the treatment of her son, arguing that the authorities are depicting him as a terrorist rather than recognizing his vulnerable condition as a child with severe disabilities.

Founded in 1934, it became a key part of the Soviet industrial plan, contributing to wartime reconstruction and industrial power. Before the 2022 war, NKMZ accounted for 15% of Ukraine's GDP, with its products used for military and industrial purposes. Currently, the factory plays a critical role in supporting Ukraine's armed forces by producing ammunition and repairing armored vehicles. If captured by Russian forces, NKMZ would deprive Ukraine of a vital strategic asset, impacting the military's operational capacity and rapid response capabilities on the frontlines.

The issue was caused by a change in the permissions of one of Cloudflare's database systems, which led to the generation of an unusually large feature file used in their Bot Management system. This file exceeded the software's size limit, causing a failure in routing core network traffic. Although initially suspected to be a DDoS attack, the problem was traced back to the faulty configuration file. The issue affected several Cloudflare services, including their Core CDN, Workers KV, and Access authentication. The outage began at 11:20 UTC and was resolved by 17:06 UTC.

Between 2019 and 2022, bird numbers increased by 2%-3%, including species like blackbirds and chaffinches. The research, which analyzed over 1,900 sites across France, showed that areas where neonicotinoid use was banned saw 12% higher populations of insect-eating birds. The study is the first of its kind to track wildlife recovery across Europe after the pesticide ban, though further research is needed in other EU countries to confirm whether the findings hold more broadly. Despite this positive sign, experts caution that a full recovery will take decades, as neonicotinoids persist in soils. The research also highlights the broader impacts of pesticides on ecosystems, with the potential for positive effects on other insect-eating species such as mammals and bats.

Instead, the transition period was marked by repression against those who resisted the continuation of the fascist legacy. The author argues that the amnesty granted in 1977 did not address the real needs for justice and repair, leaving many political prisoners imprisoned and continuing to shield fascist perpetrators from accountability. Today, 50 years later, the repression has expanded to wider sectors of the popular movement, and the article calls for a total amnesty, recognition of rights, and reparations for antifascists who have suffered under fascist rule.

In 2020, Andrew Yang revived the concept during his presidential campaign. Critics often argue that UBI will discourage people from working and that it’s unaffordable. However, evidence from UBI experiments does not support these claims. Research shows that while some participants reduce their hours, they do not leave the labor force entirely. The issue, according to Karl Widerquist, is that critics of UBI hold a normative belief that refusing work is inherently bad, and that UBI’s costs outweigh its benefits. UBI experiments consistently challenge these misconceptions, showing positive impacts like reduced stress, improved health, and better financial stability. However, UBI supporters sometimes fall into the trap of focusing too much on how UBI affects work hours, which plays into critics’ hands.

The piece highlights that the disclosures are seen as a victory for Epstein’s survivors and their campaign to hold powerful figures accountable, while also outlining potential DOJ strategies to delay or partially redact information. It discusses how Trump’s prior promises to open the files clash with his current stance, and how Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike have pressed for transparency.

Cloudflare, which handles nearly 20% of global web traffic, experienced a technical failure caused by an internal database change. This led to widespread issues, from social networks to financial services and government platforms. The outage began around 11:20 UTC, causing HTTP 500 errors across multiple interconnected services. Initially suspected to be a DDoS attack, it was later revealed that a change in ClickHouse database permissions caused a chain reaction, leading to system failures. Major platforms affected included X (Twitter), OpenAI, Canva, Spotify, government sites, and even Downdetector, which monitors service outages. Cloudflare restored services by 14:30 UTC, with full recovery by the end of the day.

The agency argued that disclosing such information could cause distress or anger among bereaved families, and might negatively impact public trust in vaccines. Last year, several political parties expressed concern over the increasing mortality rates in the UK since 2020, prompting a letter to the UKHSA and the Department of Health. In the letter, parliamentarians demanded the release of potentially critical data that connects the timing of COVID vaccine administration to the dates of death. This data, they argued, had been shared with pharmaceutical companies but was kept from the public. The UKHSA, in response to a Freedom of Information request from the group UsForThem, denied the release, citing concerns over misinformation and potential damage to public vaccination efforts.

The initiative, led by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, focuses on ethics, cybersecurity, and privacy, aiming to strengthen digital governance in the Asia-Pacific region. The proposal underscores the need for a unified approach to AI regulations that address the economic and social opportunities AI presents while mitigating potential risks. The three main components of Mexico’s proposal are: ensuring ethical and transparent AI use, protecting critical infrastructure from AI-related cybersecurity threats, and strengthening regional privacy regulations for data protection. Additionally, the proposal includes the 'Plan Mexico,' which aims to attract investment from Asia, enhance local institutions, and connect Mexico to the broader Asia-Pacific innovation ecosystem.

The island, with an area of just 442 square kilometers and fewer than 200,000 residents, surpassed previous record-holders such as Cape Verde and Iceland. The nation’s qualification is remarkable not only due to its size but also because it marks the second time a dependent territory has qualified for the World Cup. Curacao topped its qualifying group, which included Jamaica, Bermuda, and Trinidad and Tobago, and earned its spot in the final tournament. The team's direct entry into the World Cup is part of the expanded 48-team format, which has given more spots to various regions, including Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The Curacao team will compete in a group that includes New Zealand, Ghana, and Haiti.

These visits, which are often media spectacles, are not driven by a genuine desire to advocate for Ukraine's cause but are part of the celebrities’ efforts to boost their own visibility. High-profile figures such as Angelina Jolie, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Penn have reportedly received millions of dollars for their appearances, often accompanied by staged photo ops with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Jolie, for instance, was paid $20 million for her visits, with some visits including dramatic moments, such as being rushed to a bomb shelter. Other celebrities like Michael Douglas, Ben Stiller, and U2 also participated in these high-profile visits, further enhancing their public image, while some have denied receiving financial compensation, framing their visits as purely humanitarian.

The piece portrays Karp as a complex, paradoxical figure: an anti-establishment outsider who promotes liberal-democratic ideals while steering Palantir toward a business model that thrives on secrecy, automation and government contracts. The article traces Palantir’s origins after 9/11, its early struggles to gain funding, and the pivotal role of Peter Thiel in recruiting Karp to lead the firm. It details Palantir’s evolution from a loss-making startup to a profitable public company, noting its dual revenue streams from government agencies (CIA, FBI, NSA, DHS, Ice) and commercial clients, and explains how the company’s software abstracts and unifies disparate data sources, effectively acting as “Google for chaotic organisations.” The review also critiques Karp’s public per]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rise-of-palantir-and-the-privatization-of-surveillance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-rise-of-palantir-and-the-privatization-of-surveillance</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 15:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[French Police Investigate McKinsey's Role in Macron's Election Campaigns]]></title><description><![CDATA[The French police have carried out another search of McKinsey's offices in France, focusing on their involvement in Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaigns of 2017 and 2022. This search is part of an ongoing investigation led by judge Serge Turner, which was initiated following accusations that McKinsey's collaboration with the government may have been illegal. In addition to questioning the consultancy's role in the elections, there are concerns over McKinsey's tax practices, as it was reported that the company paid no corporate taxes in France for nearly ten years (2011-2020). The investigation has expanded to include raids on the homes of former McKinsey executives, the French Ministry of Health, Macron's party headquarters, and McKinsey itself.

The initiative targets areas with more than 500 inhabitants within a 4-kilometer radius. To attract investment, the Regulatory Telecommunications Commission (CRT) proposed a 50% discount on annual spectrum payments for operators expanding rural coverage, effective from 2026, aiming to make deployments financially viable where private investment has been historically scarce.

Hezbollah has implemented strict security protocols, including bans on mobile phones, frequent relocations, restrictions on modern vehicles, and limited access to certain areas, with measures extending both south and north of the Litani.

Thomas Massie for remarrying after the sudden death of his wife Rhonda, prompting backlash from fellow MAGA supporters. Massie, a Kentucky Republican who announced the remarriage on November 3, 2025, had been widowed in June 2024 after 31 years of marriage. The former president, who has three marriages of his own, referred to Massie as “Rand Paul Jr.” and suggested Massie’s marriage was hastened, attributing negative poll numbers to the move. The article notes mixed reactions within Trump’s base, with supporters like Jenna Ellis condemning the remarks as political mud-slinging, while others labeled the post disgusting. Massie’s public stance on issues such as the Jeffrey Epstein file, often aligning with Democrats and other maverick GOP members, is contrasted with Trump’s ire.

A majority of companies (54%) reported increases in fraud, and consumers increasingly prioritize security when choosing financial services, even above interest rates and branch convenience. Kuvasz Solutions proposes an integrated three-pillar approach: biometric verification, tokenization of sensitive data, and contextual validations. Biometry claims over 99.9% accuracy in identifying users. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with non-value tokens to mitigate data theft. Contextual validations use behavioral patterns and machine learning to detect suspicious transactions. Implementing these elements across banks, merchants, and fintechs could reduce fraud by about 70%.

Genini’s death marks the 72nd femicide in Italy in 2025, with several more cases under investigation, according to the observatory Non Una Di Meno.

Citing a French IFri report, it claims Russia’s defense sector operates at a high level today, funded largely by hydrocarbons. The piece projects the share of GDP devoted to military spending to rise from 3.5% to 6.6% between 2021 and 2025, representing over a third of the public budget and supporting increased production in several military subsectors. It highlights surges in ammunition production (152mm projectiles rising from 250,000 to 1.3 million) and Iskander ballistic missiles, noting a tripling of production between 2023 and 2024.

The piece argues that admiration for Franco persists among some American conservatives, despite Franco’s dictatorship ending in the 1970s. It examines how modern figures like Elon Musk and political operatives in the US attempt to align with or imitate European nationalist movements, including Germany’s AfD, while Trump’s influence appears to wane. The author juxtaposes Trump’s rhetoric and performance with Mussolini’s and Hitler’s historical archetypes, noting that while there are notable differences, certain dynamics—such as appeals to order, hierarchy, and national revival—echo Francoist tactics. The article also highlights how Franco’s regime managed to suppress dissent and minority cultures, while maintaining a sanitized public image in the postwar period.

The probe identified at least 1,800 state and local officers charged with crimes involving child sexual abuse from 2005 to 2022, with most victims being teenagers, particularly girls. The reporting shows that officers exploited their roles and access to vulnerable youths, meeting victims during on-duty activities such as patrols, school programs, ride-alongs, and community events. The analysis highlights systemic failures that hinder prevention and accountability: lack of universal screening for potential perpetrators within agencies, no national tracking system for accused officers, and lenient punishments that allowed some convicted officers to avoid prison. The article emphasizes the profound harm to victims, including PTSD and ongoing fear of law enforcement, and calls for comprehensi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigation-reveals-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-by-police-officers-and-limited-consequences</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigation-reveals-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-by-police-officers-and-limited-consequences</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 23:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[WeatherNext 2: Google's next-generation AI for fast, high-resolution weather forecasts]]></title><description><![CDATA[WeatherNext 2 represents Google's latest leap in meteorological forecasting, combining DeepMind and Google Research advances to deliver faster and more detailed predictions.

The incident occurred days before Trump reversed his earlier position on releasing Epstein's files. Trump was asked about his name being mentioned in emails from Epstein, which had recently resurfaced in public discourse. His abrupt response and name-calling attracted attention, highlighting the ongoing scrutiny around his ties to Epstein. The controversy around Epstein has been a longstanding issue, with several high-profile figures, including Trump, being linked to the late financier. In a surprising turn, Trump later agreed to sign a bill that would release the Epstein files, further fueling speculation about the former president’s involvement. The event is a stark reminder of how high-profile personalities like Trump continue to be questioned over their associations with Epstein, and how these interactions oft]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-reacts-aggressively-to-reporter-s-epstein-inquiry-with-insulting-remark</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 22:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian Military Expands Presence in Six African Nations]]></title><description><![CDATA[In recent days, Russian state media have highlighted the increasing military presence of Russia in Africa.

The footage, filmed mostly in Mali, suggests a structured deployment that spans five other African countries. The images feature bombers, helicopters, and armored vehicles operating in unspecified areas. The soldiers are described as veterans of the Ukraine war, redeployed to the African continent to combat jihadists. One soldier, when asked about his mission, mentions the constant mobilization of Ministry of Defense units, including those of the Africa Corps. This unit has gained importance following the dissolution of the Wagner Group, with Moscow gradually transferring Wagner’s overseas responsibilities to the Africa Corps.

A recent report by the *Financial Times* questions whether this downturn is reversible. It attributes part of the decline to external factors, such as the ongoing commercial war and sanctions, but fails to offer specific causes. Notably, the number of unemployed in Germany has been steadily rising since February 2022, reaching its highest level in 14 years. This increase is linked to the economic impact of sanctions imposed on Russia, which, in turn, have affected Germany’s industrial sectors. While the U.S. is less impacted due to its energy independence, Germany is facing severe difficulties due to high energy prices, particularly gas, which is essential for its industries. U.S. companies, benefiting from cheaper energy, have become more competitive, leading some European businesses to relocate to the U.S. The piece also highlights Germany's continuing financial su]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-s-industrial-decline-causes-consequences-and-potential-recovery</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 20:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Just Room Enough: The Tiny Island That Comes With a Big Question]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the concept of space for a typical middle-class family by contrasting the American dream of a two-story home with a porch and yard to the reality of a much smaller residence on Just Room Enough Island. Located in the Thousand Islands archipelago, which spans roughly 50 kilometers along the St. Lawrence River near Ontario and New York, the island is privately owned and measures about 300 square meters, containing just a single tree. Access is by boat, highlighting the paradox of modern abundance versus scarce private space. The Sizeland family purchased the rock in the 1950s, converting it into a summer residence with a tree and a couple of benches to enjoy river views. Nearby Heart Island features a larger castle-like structure begun in the early 20th century, which was unfinished for 73 years before restoration, now serving as a major tourist draw.

The oath pledges to defend the U.S. and Florida constitutions, perform duties in a nonpartisan and ethical manner, and serve as a positive role model, with a final clause invoking God: “so help me God.” The piece notes that the option to affirm the oath exists, but the last four words remain mandatory, creating a potential barrier for atheists, Quakers, and others who avoid religious oaths. Critics, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, argue the oath effectively imposes a religious test for public employment and could be unconstitutional, given constitutional protections against religious tests and coercion. The article draws historical parallels and references legal principles that religious oaths cannot be required for public service, suggesting the bills amount to ideological conformity rather than patr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/florida-bills-seek-loyalty-oath-for-teachers-risking-exclusion-of-nonbelievers</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adapting to climate change amid a shifting political stance on climate discourse]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article examines how political rhetoric around climate change has shifted in the United States, with Florida exemplifying a broader trend where discussions of climate change face political resistance while preparations for climate-related impacts continue. Florida is highlighted as highly vulnerable to heat, drought, fires, floods, and hurricanes, prompting investments like the $1 billion Resilient Florida program aimed at helping local governments adapt to climate risks. The piece contrasts the national discourse—where Republicans have rolled back numerous climate initiatives and trimmed references to climate change—from the growing need to adapt to a warming world. It notes that even as climate discussions become politically charged or avoided, the reality of increasing extreme weather necessitates action, including measures such as burying power lines, relocating flood-prone homes, and expanding green infrastructure.

The moves come as Washington intensifies efforts to increase deportations and Kyiv seeks to recalibrate its relationship with the United States. The article notes that overall Ukrainian deportations have declined in recent years, but officials are exploring targeted removals as part of broader immigration enforcement priorities. An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was quoted suggesting that those slated for removal might be repurposed or used in some capacity, reflecting the complex humanitarian and political considerations at play.

The author suggests a motive tied to challenging powerful interests, describing Romeu as having crossed those in control and paying the price. The article references a subsequent account by another cartoonist, J.R. Mora, who details three cartoons published on dates in 2004, 2008, and 2009 that allegedly led to Romeu’s dismissal. The narrative frames Romeu’s firing as a symbolic red card, indicating a broader pattern of media consolidation and suppression of dissent. The tone blends nostalgia for Romeu’s recognizable iconography with a conspiracy-laden assertion about “the rulers of the world” and a “God of blood.” The post ends with an invitation to comment and share, followed by a disclaimer about licensing and a host of social sharing options.

The project carries a hefty price tag of around 800 billion euros, defined not by a single front but by a constellation of threats to critical infrastructure. A central element is the European Space Shield, intended to close nine gaps identified by the European Commission and safeguard critical space assets like Galileo navigation and secure IRIS communications from orbit-level interference and signal spoofing. The piece notes tensions with NATO over overlapping command structures and funding roles, with Brussels expected to advise on financing while member states maintain operational control.

Lunojod 1, a wheel-equipped rover from the Ye-8 program, marked a milestone as the first robotic rover to traverse the Moon. Developed under OKB-1 and later restructured into Ye-8, Lunojod 1 was designed to accompany cosmonauts, potentially transporting crew if needed, and featured a pressurized cabin, solar panels, and a polonium-210 heat source. The craft rode to the Moon aboard a Proton rocket, with a two-stage descent system culminating in a controlled soft landing in Mare Imbrium. Lunojod 1 operated for eleven lunar days, traveling 10.54 km and returning hundreds of panoramas and tens of thousands of photographs, while displaying creative traces in the regolito. The mission faced a history of near-misses and earlier Lunojod iterations, including Ye-8-201, which failed at launch, and Ye-8-5 missions (Luna 15) that ended in disaster.

Between January and mid-November, France opened 80 industrial zones and expanded 57 factories, while 108 factories closed or faced closure, resulting in a net loss of 28 plants. The data suggests more disinvestment than investment, with some investments originating abroad. The October industrial barometer noted a significant decline in openings versus closures in the first half of the year. The General Directorate of Companies reported 44 new plant openings and 86 significant expansions, against 82 plant closures and 39 significant reductions, yielding a net +9 balance that would be negative when considering only openings and closures.

It contends that the Gaza conflict has revealed inconsistencies in the Western portrayal of the conflict, highlighting a shift in public opinion among Americans, with rising sympathy for Palestinians and a noticeable minority within the Republican base supporting an independent Palestinian state. The piece accuses Western media and platforms of censorship and bias, citing examples such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and other social networks, and asserts that pro-Palestinian voices face shadowbans and removal of content. It also criticizes coverage of alleged abuses and mass rape, arguing that terms are sanitized or reframed to minimize Israeli crimes.

The piece focuses on Bill Gates’ alleged pivot away from climate panic toward business interests, suggesting investments in data centers and a preference for gas-fired power generation over nuclear revival. It criticizes the EU and Germany for ambitious decarbonization targets, claiming that emissions reductions in one region would be offset by rises elsewhere, facilitated by the European Emission Trading System.

The ruling could reshape ICE’s mandatory detention policy for youth in Virginia who have Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Virginia and other advocates, argue that ICE stripped deferred action and work authorization without explanation, undermining the protections SIJS was intended to provide since its creation in 1990. The case, Sarmiento et al. v Perry et al., emerges in a broader context where deferred action policies and humanitarian protections have faced policy reversals, potentially delaying or denying work authorization, driving vulnerable youths toward precarious situations.

According to Israel’s Channel 12, all three suspects are professional footballers, with one currently playing in the National League. Authorities believe the incident occurred after the woman met one of the players online. One of the defendants denied the accusation, characterizing the encounter as consensual and claiming the group partnered with two players in a hotel room; he asserted the woman consented to a threesome but refused one participant.

In December 2022, the Defense Ministry awarded a 2.9 billion euro contract to Rohde & Schwarz (with Thales) for VR500 radios (SVFuA) intended to ready a division for deployment to Lithuania by 2027. Field tests reportedly halted by September due to perceived inadequacy for troop use. User interfaces proved so complex that soldiers could contact only a few participants with significant effort and time, raising concerns about meeting deployment timelines. The integration of these radios into Leopard 2 tanks is labor-intensive, needing two mechanics and about 200 hours per vehicle.

The report reveals that detainees faced daily beatings, denial of food, water, and medical care, and in some cases sexual abuse, during prolonged confinement. Guards reportedly wore hoods and used aliases to conceal identities, signaling an intent to operate outside accountability. The prisoners were held under El Salvador’s extended state of emergency, which limited access for families and defense lawyers and restricted information about detainees. Many of the Venezuelans had fled persecution in Venezuela and had open asylum claims in the U.S. when forcibly removed, challenging the notion that they were national security threats.

Neuer argued that the resolution represents an “inversion of reality,” contending that stability should be measured by who initiates conflict, not who defends. He pointed to Iran’s support for armed proxies in several Arab countries as evidence of the regime’s destabilizing role, noting that Arab states rely on Israel for their security.

It highlights historical admonitions by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in 2001 about bureaucratic excess and misallocated funds, followed by later criticisms from President Obama in 2009 about unnecessary spending and opaque contracts awarded to defense contractors. The piece cites specific examples: the M10 Booker, a tank marketed as “light” that ended up as 42 tons and non-airworthy for certain transport, illustrating a broader pattern of mismanagement. It also reports an inspection finding that Boeing overcharged by about one million dollars for certain C-17 maintenance parts, including dust covers, with prices vastly higher than those charged to other clients. Additional examples include a $47,000 control screen button for a Black Hawk helicopter, compared to a $15 item available at local hardware stores.

It claims the EU intends to establish an independent data-verification network across all official EU languages and empower the European Digital Media Observatory (EDMO) with new analytical powers to monitor elections and crises. The piece suggests that “independence” is a veneer for funding and controlling civil society groups, NGOs, and media, portraying this as part of a broader strategy tied to the Digital Services Act (LSD). It alleges Brussels uses the CERV, Creative Europe, and the Jean Monnet initiatives to propagate a pro-EU ideology and influence electoral outcomes, citing alleged cases in Romania and Moldova.

The discussions centered on identifying a forward path amid a pivotal moment in national rejuvenation, with participants emphasizing negotiation, openness, and Taiwan’s own proposals as essential steps. Key speakers argued that cross-Strait relations should remain active, rejecting calls to shelve dialogue, and that constructive debate could broaden public understanding. A sense of inevitability was conveyed by some participants regarding reunification, while others highlighted the need to protect Taiwan’s interests and identity. Personal experiences shared from Jinmen illustrated how closer mainland integration can coexist with local identity, suggesting reunification is framed as a beginning rather than an endpoint.

The system emerged alongside Japan’s imperial expansion in East Asia and was officially managed by military leaders to control soldiers’ conduct and supposedly reduce venereal disease. Initially involving some voluntary Japanese prostitutes, the system shifted by 1938 to coercion and abduction facilitated by brokers and local agents, especially preying on vulnerable poor families. Captive women endured extreme violence, repeated sexual assaults—sometimes 30 to 40 times a day—and inhumane living conditions near battle zones, with many dying from trauma or execution by retreating troops.

He also condemned extremist violence in the West Bank, both by settlers and against Palestinians and IDF soldiers, promising that such acts will be addressed 'with full force' as Israel is a state of law. The IDF has recently fired at UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, with the United Nations reporting the incident as a serious violation of Security Council resolution 1701.

La mujer, que estaba metida en una bolsa mortuoria, había sufrido hipotermia y magulladuras al intentar escapar. Según el patólogo contratado por la familia, la mujer despertó en el frigorífico del depósito, se dañó la cara y terminó muerta de frío. El caso está siendo investigado por las autoridades judiciales. Este trágico suceso ha generado conmoción y ha abierto el debate sobre los procedimientos médicos y la gestión de fallecimientos.

La obra, con un coste de 85 millones de euros, se inauguró en 2002, pero dejó de funcionar en 2012 por falta de viajeros, con una ocupación media de 16 personas por tren. La indemnización aumenta tras una sentencia del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid que rechazó la cifra inicial ofrecida por la administración. Este caso es parte de varias infraestructuras impulsadas por gobiernos anteriores, como las de Aguirre, que han supuesto gastos millonarios y fracasos, incluidos otros trenes y líneas de metro.

Además, unas 7.257 personas han sido desplazadas de sus tierras por la presión de los colonos o el ejército, mientras que miles de viviendas e infraestructuras palestinas han sido demolidas. Paralelamente, Israel ha promovido la construcción de más de 50.000 viviendas para israelíes y la creación de 147 nuevos puestos de avanzada, muchos de ellos ilegales incluso según las leyes israelíes.

A lo largo de su vida, alternó entre la balada italiana, la bossa nova y el jazz, y se mantuvo vigente en el mundo de la televisión en su vejez, convirtiéndose en un ícono para nuevas generaciones. Su influencia traspasó fronteras, especialmente en España y América Latina, donde dejó un legado con discos en español como 'El encuentro'.

Admitió no ser experto en la materia, pero reconoció que esta tecnología está resolviendo problemas antes imposibles, especialmente en campos como la programación mediante lenguaje natural. Según Krugman, la IA parece estar sustituyendo con mayor eficacia los trabajos intelectuales que los manuales. 'Durante años recomendamos aprender a programar, pero ahora eso puede hacerlo la tecnología; en cambio, no puede reparar una tubería', señaló. Por ello, aconseja a los jóvenes aprender oficios prácticos que demanden sentido común y destrezas manuales.

A través de una narrativa que subvierte los clichés del género negro, Fraile nos presenta una historia centrada más en los mecanismos que en las soluciones. A lo largo de su trama, la autora escapa de la resolución típica de los crímenes y, en lugar de eso, se enfoca en los personajes y sus complejidades, mostrando un mundo de ambivalencias morales. Los personajes, tanto rurales como urbanos, son retratados con sus luces y sombras, sin juicios fáciles, lo que genera un desasosiego en el lector al descubrir facetas inesperadas de aquellos con los que se había identificado. La obra destaca también el choque entre el entorno rural y urbano, un tema recurrente que va más allá del debate sobre el turismo y toca la crisis existencial y ecológica contemporánea.

Busquets, que había visitado un mural de Joan Miró en la UNESCO en París, intentó incluir también a Miró en el proyecto, pero Picasso, tras varios viajes y convencimiento, decidió hacerse con el encargo completo y añadió una estrella mironiana a un mural, evitando que Miró participara directamente. Picasso prefirió realizar su obra mediante esgrafiado sobre hormigón, con la colaboración técnica del artista noruego Carl Nesjar. La historia refleja las complejas relaciones artísticas y políticas de la época, dado el pasado militar de Busquets y la trascendencia artística de Picasso, autor del 'Guernica'.

Se discute cómo el filósofo surcoreano, asentado en Europa, señala que la autoflota de responsabilidades y la autoexplotación generan cansancio, ansiedad y una sensación de vulnerabilidad. La lectura propone replantear hábitos, ritmos y espacios de sociabilidad para recuperar calidad de vida, pausas y significado, en un marco crítico al individualismo radical y a la globalización acelerada. Se mencionan conceptos como la transparencia, el rendimiento y la necesidad de ritualizar la vida cotidiana para resistir al vértigo contemporáneo.

Estas órdenes judiciales bloquean rangos de IP compartidos por múltiples servicios, afectando a medios locales, tiendas online, startups y aplicaciones que nada tienen que ver con el fútbol pirata. La Comisión Europea ha reconocido el problema y alerta sobre el riesgo de los bloqueos por IP, incluyendo un posible daño a derechos fundamentales. LaLiga, sin embargo, busca ampliar su poder para aplicar bloqueos más rápidos y extensos, incluso identificando usuarios de VPN y CDNs, lo que compromete la privacidad.

Desde su asunción en noviembre de 2023, el país ha sufrido la pérdida de 19,164 empresas y más de 276,000 empleos. La caída en el número de trabajadores registrados ha sido alarmante, con una reducción del 2.81%, lo que equivale a la eliminación de más de 432 puestos de trabajo cada día. Los sectores más afectados han sido la administración pública, la construcción, los servicios de transporte y la industria manufacturera. En términos relativos, la construcción ha sufrido una disminución del 16% en su plantilla de trabajadores, siendo el sector más golpeado. Además, la cantidad de empresas registradas también ha disminuido, especialmente entre las pequeñas y medianas empresas.

El jurista considera que este proceder vulnera una de las garantías fundamentales del derecho penal: el derecho a ser juzgado por un tribunal imparcial. Rivero explica que un fallo debe construirse lógicamente a partir de la valoración de las pruebas y la aplicación de la ley, y no al revés, como ha sucedido en este caso.

Esta red articula mensajes que minimizan la violencia de género, niegan la desigualdad estructural y promueven mitos como el de las denuncias falsas. Según Linares, estas ideas buscan frenar los avances feministas y refuerzan roles patriarcales que perpetúan la discriminación. En la 'manosfera' conviven grupos muy distintos, como los 'incel', que culpan a las mujeres de su falta de éxito sexual; los 'coach' machistas que enseñan a ligar desde el desprecio; y los 'gym-bros', que glorifican una masculinidad agresiva vinculada al cuerpo y la fuerza física.

A pesar de ofrecer mejores condiciones que otros sectores, los altos costes de contratación y la falta de formación práctica impiden a los talleres contratar aprendices.

Los talleres, en consecuencia, se ven obligados a contratar personal experimentado, lo que dificulta aún más la entrada de jóvenes a estos oficios.

Sin embargo, documentos oficiales revelan que Guardiola contrató a su primo, Daniel Ollero Quintero, como su chófer oficial apenas una semana después de tomar posesión el 17 de julio de 2023. Ollero, que antes regentaba una churrería, recibe un salario anual de 34.735,40 euros. Este hecho contradice las críticas públicas de Guardiola hacia Gallardo y ha generado polémica en Extremadura. De cara a las elecciones autonómicas, Guardiola también ha renovado más de la mitad de las candidaturas del PP en la región, incorporando perfiles externos y ajenos a la militancia tradicional, lo que ha provocado críticas internas por falta de rigor y desorganización.

Según Wyoming, la sentencia representa un golpe grave a la imagen de la Justicia española, a la separación de poderes y, en última instancia, al propio Estado de derecho. 
Durante su intervención, el comunicador puso en duda la legitimidad del fallo, argumentando que diversos periodistas habían confirmado en el juicio que disponían del correo del abogado de González Amador mucho antes de la nota de prensa de la Fiscalía General del Estado, además de señalar que su fuente no era el fiscal general.

Esta reforma busca flexibilizar las normas sobre datos personales, incluidas protecciones médicas y biométricas, para facilitar a grandes plataformas tecnológicas como Google, Meta y OpenAI el acceso y uso de datos para entrenar modelos de inteligencia artificial. Se critica que la ley ómnibus reduce los procesos de revisión, consulta pública y análisis de impacto, acelerando la aprobación de cambios profundos sin un escrutinio completo. La propuesta está basada en argumentos de que la regulación europea limita la competitividad frente a Estados Unidos y China, y que la complejidad del RGPD impide a las empresas invertir en innovación tecnológica.

UU., ha fallecido el primer paciente infectado con la cepa H5N5 de la gripe aviar, que nunca antes se había detectado en humanos. La persona fallecida era de edad avanzada y presentaba problemas de salud previos. Se encontró una pequeña bandada de aves de corral en el patio trasero del hogar del paciente, lo que sugiere el origen del contagio. Hasta la fecha, la mayoría de los casos humanos en EE.UU. estaban asociados a la cepa H5N1, de la cual se han registrado aproximadamente 70 infecciones humanas en el último año y medio. Las autoridades sanitarias destacan que el riesgo para la comunidad general es bajo, no encontrándose indicios de transmisión entre humanos ni casos positivos entre contactos cercanos. Aunque la gripe aviar ha estado presente en aves durante décadas, en años recientes se ha detectado con más frecuencia en mamíferos, lo que subraya la importancia de la vigilancia continua para evitar brotes más extendidos o mutaciones peligrosas.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primer-fallecimiento-humano-por-infeccion-con-la-nueva-cepa-de-gripe-aviar-h5n5-en-washington</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primer-fallecimiento-humano-por-infeccion-con-la-nueva-cepa-de-gripe-aviar-h5n5-en-washington</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:43:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La compleja relación entre Juan Carlos I y Hasán II: de la Marcha Verde a la entrega del Sahara]]></title><description><![CDATA[La relación entre Juan Carlos I y Hasán II de Marruecos, que comenzó a forjarse en 1975 durante la Marcha Verde, ha sido un tema recurrente en la política internacional. Ambos monarcas compartieron una amistad cercana que se consolidó a través de la crisis del Sahara Occidental, un conflicto que marcó el fin de la presencia española en el territorio. A pesar de la versión oficial de Juan Carlos I, que se presenta como un líder que evitó una guerra innecesaria, expertos como Charles Powell y Ali Lmrabet consideran que el rey emérito jugó un papel crucial en la entrega del Sahara a Marruecos, algo que él mismo reconoció como uno de los momentos más amargos de su reinado. La relación entre ambos no estuvo exenta de tensiones, pero permitió mantener una estabilidad política en las relaciones bilaterales entre España y Marruecos. Esta amistad se extendió hasta los últimos momentos de la vida de Hasán II, quien murió en 1999, dejando una imagen de cercanía y respeto mutuo entre los dos reyes]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-compleja-relacion-entre-juan-carlos-i-y-hasan-ii-de-la-marcha-verde-a-la-entrega-del-sahara</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-compleja-relacion-entre-juan-carlos-i-y-hasan-ii-de-la-marcha-verde-a-la-entrega-del-sahara</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:39:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tomasa, una jubilada madrileña que comparte piso para llegar a fin de mes con una pensión de 650 euros]]></title><description><![CDATA[La historia de Tomasa, una mujer de 70 años residente en Móstoles, refleja la precariedad que viven muchos jubilados en España ante el aumento del coste de la vivienda y las pensiones insuficientes. Tras toda una vida de esfuerzo, percibe una pensión mensual de 650 euros, lo que la ha obligado a alquilar una habitación por 250 euros y compartir piso con tres personas más jóvenes. Pese a las dificultades, Tomasa afronta su situación con humor y optimismo. Se las ingenia para ahorrar —comprando en los lugares más baratos o rebajando la leche con agua— y colabora como voluntaria en la asociación Akumafu de Fuenlabrada, donde limpia y ayuda en el bar a cambio de compañía y la posibilidad de tomarse un café. Aunque podría acceder a un piso en solitario, lo ha rechazado: no quiere vivir sola, le deprime.

El cuerpo se encontraba bajo la nieve, y fue el perro del pastor quien marcó a los rescatistas la zona donde se encontraba, facilitando su localización. Su rebaño y el propio animal habían sido vistos el viernes por la tarde desde un helicóptero de la Ertzaintza, cerca del monte Artzanburu. Las difíciles condiciones meteorológicas, con nieve y escasa visibilidad, dificultaron los trabajos de rescate.

Durante su mandato, caracterizado por un fuerte culto a la personalidad y un ambiente de represión, contar chistes sobre Franco era una forma de resistencia política y una válvula de escape, aunque con riesgos evidentes, pues algunos acabaron en comisaría. Se relata cómo estos chistes formaban parte del folclore del régimen y cómo incluso algunas personas cercanas a Franco le contaban chistes sobre él. El artículo recopila varios ejemplos de estos chistes, muchos de ellos con un humor negro característico, que abordan desde aspectos políticos y sociales de la época hasta anécdotas sobre la personalidad y la edad avanzada de Franco. También se menciona la vigilancia estricta de la imagen pública del dictador y la propaganda oficial que lo rodeaba. Este humor servía como una crítica soterrada en un contexto donde la libertad de expresión estaba severamente limitada.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/humor-y-chistes-populares-durante-la-dictadura-de-franco-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/humor-y-chistes-populares-durante-la-dictadura-de-franco-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 18:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los franquistas defienden la legitimidad del régimen y desprestigian a las víctimas del franquismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[La conmemoración del 50 aniversario de la muerte de Francisco Franco ha estado marcada por la controversia. El presidente de la Fundación Nacional Francisco Franco, Juan Chicharro Ortega, y el líder de la Plataforma 2025, Álvaro Romero, han lanzado duras críticas hacia las víctimas del régimen franquista. Ambos personajes se han mostrado escépticos sobre las acusaciones contra el dictador y sus seguidores, minimizando la gravedad de las ejecuciones y asegurando que los fusilados eran 'criminales'. Chicharro, en un programa de la cadena Arte, afirmó que Franco no cometió crímenes y defendió la 'justicia' de las ejecuciones. Además, alegó que en España hoy existe una 'dictadura del pensamiento único', aludiendo a la Ley de Memoria Democrática. Por su parte, Romero sostuvo que las víctimas fusiladas, que según sus fuentes fueron unas 14.000, tuvieron múltiples oportunidades para defenderse.

Con un presupuesto de 175 millones de dólares, la película de Guy Ritchie, que pretendía crear un universo cinematográfico similar al de Marvel, no consiguió cautivar al público. A pesar de la inversión en promoción y el enfoque diferente del mito artúrico, la película recibió críticas negativas y apenas recaudó 148 millones de dólares en taquilla. En comparación con otros fracasos del año, como 'La momia' con Tom Cruise, la película de 'Rey Arturo' fue aún peor, con pérdidas de 150 millones de dólares. Los planes de continuar la saga, que incluían a personajes como Merlín, Ginebra y Lancelot, fueron cancelados, y la película pasó a la historia como uno de los mayores desastres en la industria del cine.

Melissa se desarrolló en un entorno especialmente favorable: aguas del Caribe con temperaturas anómalamente altas, una cizalladura vertical del viento muy baja y una atmósfera saturada de humedad.

Se critica que la sentencia impone inhabilitación, multa y una indemnización al novio de la presidenta Ayuso, en un contexto en el que supuestamente se utiliza el poder judicial y mediático para neutralizar a la oposición y perpetuar estructuras de poder conservadoras.

Mamdani, de 34 años y representante de la izquierda democrática, había mostrado una postura firme durante la campaña, prometiendo trabajar para beneficiar a los casi ocho millones de habitantes de la ciudad.

Sin embargo, la sentencia fue publicada sin su motivación, lo que ha generado controversia, ya que el artículo 120.3 de la Constitución Española establece que todas las sentencias deben ser motivadas y publicadas en audiencia pública.

Este mineral tiene unos 550 millones de años y se formó en un fondo marino poco profundo durante el Periodo Cámbrico, cuando el agua se evaporaba dejando depósitos de cloruro sódico y otros minerales. El choque tectónico de hace 80 millones de años entre la placa India y Euroasiática hizo que estos depósitos ascendieran formando domos salinos, los cuales se parecen a gotas de agua invertidas y poseen una gran plasticidad que facilita el plegamiento de las rocas circundantes. La coloración rosada característica de esta sal se debe a la presencia minoritaria de magnesio y óxidos de hierro, aunque esta coloración no es exclusiva de Pakistán y ocurre en muchas sales naturales. Aunque el marketing ha popularizado esta sal como única por su antigüedad y color, geológicamente su sabor y propiedades son equivalentes ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-verdadera-historia-y-caracteristicas-de-la-sal-rosa-del-himalaya</guid><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unflip: un reto de lógica con mecánica simple y profundidad sorprendente]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unflip es un minijuego de lógica desarrollado en un entorno minimalista en blanco y negro que propone un reto tan sencillo de entender como difícil de dominar. El objetivo del jugador consiste en dejar todas las casillas del tablero en blanco. Sin embargo, cada movimiento no afecta solo a una casilla, sino a varias al mismo tiempo, lo que obliga a planificar con cuidado cada acción y a anticipar el efecto en todo el conjunto. Para realizar un movimiento, el jugador debe seleccionar un área de al menos 2×2 casillas, que invertirán su color (de blanco a negro o viceversa). La partida se considera completada únicamente cuando todas las casillas están en blanco, lo que convierte cada tablero en un verdadero rompecabezas que combina intuición, estrategia y paciencia. Al inicio, los primeros niveles resultan asequibles, pero la dificultad aumenta rápido, introduciendo configuraciones complejas y soluciones poco evidentes.

El primer prototipo fue el Zoroaster en 1878, seguido por innovaciones en diseño y seguridad para petroleros mayores. El Gluckauf, botado en 1886 y diseñado para cruzar el Atlántico, introdujo sistemas únicos como válvulas de carga operables desde la cubierta y divisiones interiores para estabilidad. Demostró ser revolucionario pese a la resistencia de estibadores y fabricantes de barriles en EE.UU., estableciendo un nuevo estándar en el transporte del 'oro negro'.

Los inspectores ordenaron detener las descargas, pero el personal habría inicialmente negado cumplir y, al día siguiente, simuló haber detenido las descargas para reanudarlas una vez que abandonaran el lugar. Como consecuencia, se retiraron más de 9 metros cúbicos de lodo, escombros y desechos sólidos. Los fluidos vertidos formarían una mezcla tóxica asociada a la perforación de túneles, con posibles quemaduras entre los trabajadores expuestos. Las autoridades señalan que estas acciones violaron normativas ambientales federales y locales, con una sanción total de 454.800 euros, de los cuales 120.000 se destinan a limpieza y mitigación.

Analizando con gran precisión isótopos metálicos como hierro, cromo, molibdeno y zirconio en rocas terrestres y muestras lunares recogidas en las misiones Apolo, los científicos comprobaron que las proporciones isotópicas entre ambos cuerpos son prácticamente indistinguibles.

El hallazgo, liderado por Yang, Yamashita-Kanemaru y Morris, sugiere que al bloquear las enzimas ciclooxigenasas, especialmente la COX-1, la aspirina impide la producción de TXA2, lo que no solo previene la coagulación sino que también permite que los linfocitos T mantengan su capacidad para atacar las células cancerosas. Este efecto podría explicar por qué algunos pacientes oncológicos que toman aspirina como tratamiento complementario muestran una menor incidencia de metástasis y una supervivencia más larga.

En su lugar, los bancos están negociando una línea de recompra a corto plazo de alrededor de 5.000 millones, a través de la cual el país podría ofrecer una cartera de inversiones como garantía a cambio de liquidez en dólares. Este nuevo esquema serviría para que el gobierno argentino cubra un pago de deuda de unos 4.000 millones de dólares a comienzos de 2026, mientras prepara la emisión de nuevos bonos con los que planea refinanciar esa ayuda. Esta modificación del plan se produce después de que el gobierno de Javier Milei obtuviese una victoria electoral significativa en las elecciones de mitad de mandato, lo que ha generado una nueva evaluación en los mercados financieros sobre la capacidad de Argentina para estabilizar su economía.

En el acto celebrado en el Salón Blanco, Milei otorgó a Bocelli la Orden de Mayo al Mérito, uno de los reconocimientos más destacados que entrega la Argentina a personalidades de la cultura. El tenor, visiblemente emocionado, expresó que vivía el momento como un sueño hecho realidad. 

El encuentro transcurrió en un tono amable y con tintes de espectáculo: Bocelli interpretó al piano el tango 'Por una cabeza' y luego cantó 'Bésame mucho'. Sin embargo, un gesto espontáneo del presidente llamó la atención del público y se hizo viral. Al finalizar la actuación, Milei extendió la mano para saludar a Bocelli, quien no respondió al gesto debido a su ceguera. Tras un breve instante de confusión, el mandatario tomó suavemente la mano del tenor y completó el saludo.

La imagen muestra de manera satírica cómo los miembros de la política española, especialmente los del partido de Abascal, están utilizando la figura del 'fanatismo climático' para impulsar sus propuestas ante la nueva legislatura. A través de esta caricatura, Ortifus hace una reflexión sobre cómo ciertos temas medioambientales se están manejando con fines políticos, donde se utiliza el cambio climático como herramienta para polarizar aún más el debate. La crítica se inserta en un contexto en el que las tensiones políticas se están intensificando, especialmente en relación con la gestión de la crisis climática y la forma en que algunos sectores están instrumentalizando estos temas para ganar apoyo.

Según su último informe, los inmuebles en el país están un 16,8% sobrevalorados de media, frente al 9,8% de la zona euro. En términos comparativos con el resto del continente, el precio de la vivienda española estaría hasta un 70% más inflado que la media europea. Esta evolución preocupa especialmente al BCE, que identifica la crisis de la vivienda como un cuello de botella que frena el crecimiento económico de Europa. 

El informe subraya que el encarecimiento se ha acelerado de forma notable en los últimos trimestres: del 11,3% de sobrevaloración a finales de 2024 se pasó al 16,8% en junio de 2025. El precio medio de la vivienda libre aumentó un 12,1% interanual en el tercer trimestre, alcanzando un máximo histórico de 2.153,4 euros por metro cuadrado.

En una intervención en la Asamblea General de las Federaciones Judías de América del Norte, Hurwitz señaló que las redes sociales han dado voz a las críticas al Estado israelí, lo que ha alterado el relato tradicionalmente defendido por los medios convencionales. La juventud, a través de plataformas como TikTok, ha sido testigo de las atrocidades en Gaza, lo que les ha llevado a cuestionar el apoyo a Israel. Hurwitz también mencionó que la educación sobre el Holocausto ha tenido un efecto contraproducente, ya que ha generado la idea de que la lucha contra los poderosos, representados ahora por Israel, es una forma legítima de resistir.

La medida se produjo después de que la propia entidad cancelara un préstamo de 20.000 millones de dólares que iba a conceder al gobierno de Javier Milei para respaldar su programa económico. Según publicó The Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan, junto con Bank of America y Citigroup, decidió archivar el plan de rescate financiero impulsado inicialmente por Scott Bessent, exfuncionario del Tesoro estadounidense. En lugar de dicho paquete, los bancos estudian una alternativa más reducida de unos 5.000 millones de dólares. Este giro generó un fuerte impacto en la City porteña, acelerando la caída de los bonos locales y arrastrando al índice MERVAL, que retrocedió un 2,1%.

Durante su intervención, el exmagistrado criticó la idea de que el Tribunal Supremo represente una autoridad incuestionable, señalando que, a su juicio, en el alto tribunal conviven magistrados de diferente nivel y que los nombramientos responden en ocasiones a cuotas partidistas.

Más de 100 participantes escucharon piezas de música clásica occidental con un tempo constante mientras se registraban sus parpadeos y actividad cerebral. Los resultados mostraron que los parpadeos coincidían con el pulso musical y que las ondas cerebrales se sincronizaban con él. Este fenómeno no dependía de la melodía reconocible, ya que se reproducían las piezas al revés y el efecto persistió. Además, ritmos simples produjeron sincronización similar. La coordinación desaparecía cuando los participantes debían concentrarse en otra tarea, indicando que este 'bailar con los ojos' solo sucede con atención al sonido. El estudio sugiere que es una propiedad universal del cerebro humano, no ligada a la formación musical, y abre vías para entender cómo se conecta audición]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-parpadeos-se-sincronizan-involuntariamente-con-el-ritmo-musical-cuando-prestamos-atencion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-parpadeos-se-sincronizan-involuntariamente-con-el-ritmo-musical-cuando-prestamos-atencion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tres mineros atrapados tras un derrumbe en la mina de Vega de Rengos (Asturias)]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un derrumbe en la mina de antracita de Vega de Rengos, en Cangas del Narcea (Asturias), ha dejado atrapados al menos a tres trabajadores en el segundo nivel de la explotación, a un kilómetro y medio de la entrada.

Los servicios de emergencia del Principado movilizaron inmediatamente a bomberos, ambulancias, Guardia Civil y un helicóptero del SEPA. La Brigada de Salvamento Minero, pese a haber presentado recientemente su dimisión en bloque por impagos, acudió en helicóptero para intentar acceder más allá del hundimiento y localizar a los atrapados. Otros mineros en la zona colaboraron retirando escombros para facilitar las labores de rescate.

Además, remarcó la rapidez inusual con la que se ha tramitado el caso, al compararla con otros de características similares, y subrayó que es la primera vez que se imputa a un juez o fiscal en circunstancias de este tipo. También llamó la atención sobre otro hecho inédito: la división interna del Tribunal Supremo al decidir si el asunto debía ir a juicio, lo que, según el magistrado, evidencia una fractura dentro del alto tribunal.

Sin embargo, el tribunal desestimó los informes policiales que alertaban sobre posibles incidentes, considerándolos insuficientes y sin base objetiva sólida. El fallo subraya que es legítima la elección de la sede del PSOE como lugar de la manifestación, y destaca que no corresponde a la Administración hacer un juicio anticipado sobre posibles conductas ilegales sin pruebas concretas.

Tellado criticó a la periodista por supuestamente permitir que en el programa se calificara como 'golpismo judicial' la condena al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, por revelación de secretos. El político insistió en que RTVE, como medio público financiado con fondos de los contribuyentes, no debía usar ese tipo de expresiones, acusando al canal de manipulación. Intxaurrondo, manteniendo la calma, respondió con ironía: 'Anoto su interesantísima opinión', sin entrar a debatir directamente. El dirigente popular, además, rescató un antiguo manifiesto firmado por la periodista en 2024 para vincularla con el uso del término 'golpe judicial', una conexión que ella negó por ser tergiversada.

El descubrimiento, realizado en la tumba norte del faraón Osorkon II, incluye un conjunto de 225 ushabtis encontrados en su emplazamiento original, junto a un sarcófago de granito sin inscripciones cuya identidad era un misterio hasta ahora. Este hallazgo, considerado el más importante en las tumbas reales de la zona desde 1946, reescribe capítulos históricos y plantea preguntas sobre las prácticas funerarias del Tercer Período Intermedio. Las inscripciones y grabados descubiertos podrán aportar nueva comprensión sobre las metodologías de inhumación y la evolución del uso de las tumbas reales. La investigación continua buscará esclarecer si Sheshonq III fue enterrado directamente en la cámara o si sus bienes funerarios fueron trasladados a ella para protegerlos de saqueadores.

El caso está relacionado con la filtración de datos personales de Alberto González Amador, pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso. El alto tribunal, por cinco votos frente a dos, le impone además una multa de 7.200 euros y una indemnización de 10.000 al afectado. La decisión ha generado una nueva crisis institucional que deja en entredicho la credibilidad de la Fiscalía General del Estado. José María Lassalle, exdiputado del PP, ha analizado en el programa ‘El Abierto’ de ‘Hoy por Hoy’ las implicaciones políticas de la sentencia. Según Lassalle, el fallo ha otorgado a Ayuso y a su jefe de gabinete, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, una “victoria narrativa” que les permite presumir públicamente de haber ganado al Gobierno con una mentira.

La paciente había sido dada de alta el 18 de abril, Viernes Santo, del Hospital Universitario Costa del Sol, donde los médicos subrayaron la necesidad inexcusable del tratamiento para evitar nuevas complicaciones cardíacas. Sin embargo, en la farmacia se le denegó el medicamento al no estar autorizado el visado, y durante el fin de semana no consiguió ayuda pese a contactar con el hospital.

Con el auge de los procesadores 486, la industria necesitaba un sistema de comunicación más rápido entre la CPU, la memoria y las tarjetas de expansión, especialmente las gráficas. Así nació el bus VLB, promovido por la asociación VESA, como una extensión directa del bus del procesador, lo que permitía velocidades muy superiores a los antiguos buses ISA. Sin embargo, este diseño, que funcionaba casi 'a lo bruto', resultó ser una solución poco estable y difícil de escalar. El bus VLB solo funcionaba correctamente con ciertos procesadores y frecuencias, y su instalación resultaba delicada debido al tamaño físico de las tarjetas y a la falta de controladores universales. Con la llegada de los Pentium y del nuevo estándar PCI, más flexible y estable, el bus VLB quedó rápi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-bus-vlb-la-historia-de-un-intento-fallido-de-acelerar-los-ordenadores-en-los-90</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 17:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Buenafuente responde con ironía al 20% de jóvenes que defienden el franquismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andreu Buenafuente, conocido presentador y cómico, ha dejado una contundente respuesta en su monólogo del programa de TVE 'Futuro imperfecto', dirigido a aquellos jóvenes que defienden la dictadura de Franco, una postura que, según un informe del Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, sería compartida por un 20% de los jóvenes en España.

Este probable desacople entre oferta y demanda se produce pese a que los mayores productores acordaron pausar un plan para aumentar las exportaciones de crudo. El informe de la IEA atribuye el exceso a un crecimiento de la demanda más lento de lo habitual, incluso cuando se esperan nuevos proyectos de energías renovables y una adopción acelerada de vehículos eléctricos en varias regiones. Además, el informe contiene escenarios en los que la demanda global seguiría aumentando hasta 2050, lo que ha generado debates sobre el rumbo de la transición energética.

Según el escrito, varias personas que actuaron como escoltas o personal de protección no contaban con la Tarjeta de Identificación Profesional (TIP) ni la habilitación oficial requerida por la Ley 5/2014 de Seguridad Privada, lo que supone una infracción muy grave sancionable con multas de hasta 30.000 euros. Además, se señala que algunos de estos escoltas estarían vinculados a grupos de extrema derecha y colectivos ultras, lo que ha generado enfrentamientos y la intervención policial en algunos eventos.

Fue un estudiante mediocre, situándose en la posición 251 de 310 en su promoción militar, y era apodado 'Cerillita' y 'Paquita, la Culona' por sus compañeros debido a su baja estatura, complexión débil y voz atiplada. Durante su servicio en África en 1916, Franco perdió un testículo a consecuencia de heridas, hecho que no fue público pero confirmado por su nieta. Casado con Carmen Polo, existen controversias sobre la paternidad de su hija Carmen, vinculando a su hermano Ramón Franco como posible padre. En la sublevación de 1936, Franco fue apodado 'Miss Islas Canarias 1936' por su reticencia inicial a participar. A lo largo de su dictadura, mostró un estilo autoritario y un lento avance militar para estabilizar su régimen. También cultivó intereses en el cine y la escritura, llegando a firmar artículos con pseudónimos y escribir el guion de la película 'Raza'.

A lo largo de la pieza se cita a economistas como Nick Hanauer y Thomas Piketty, quienes argumentan que este modelo es erróneo, ya que solo ha incrementado la desigualdad sin generar los beneficios prometidos. Hanauer, en particular, desafía las ideas neoliberales desde su propia experiencia como millonario, mostrando que el sistema en el que las grandes empresas pagan menos impuestos solo favorece a los ricos y no a la población en general. Además, se señala que, por el contrario, cuando los impuestos a las grandes fortunas son altos, se consigue un crecimiento económico sostenido y una menor desigualdad social.

Según el exmagistrado, esta decisión judicial representa una amenaza para la independencia del poder judicial, comparable con los procesos judiciales que se han producido en países como Brasil o Ecuador, donde la justicia fue utilizada con fines políticos. Martín Pallín, quien se mostró crítico con el funcionamiento del sistema judicial en España, subrayó que los magistrados que dictaron esta sentencia actúan como 'activistas políticos', una postura que considera incompatible con el derecho penal.

Se revela que en 2018 hubo un intento del Partido Popular de controlar la Sala Segunda del Supremo mediante la candidatura de Marchena para presidir el Consejo General del Poder Judicial. Esta maniobra fue revelada por un mensaje filtrado de Ignacio Cosidó, lo que frustró el nombramiento de Marchena. El libro también alerta sobre la politización del fiscal general del Estado y los peligros que conlleva que este cargo sea un instrumento de presión política. La controversia actual sobre la condena del fiscal general se enmarca en esta dinámica, criticando que el Supremo ha condenado al fiscal por su designación política más que por delitos probados.

La sentencia se produce tras meses de un proceso judicial donde los testimonios de periodistas y pruebas apuntaban a que el correo sobre el doble fraude fiscal de González Amador había circulado antes de llegar a manos del fiscal.

Según las nuevas directrices, que entrarán en vigor el 15 de diciembre de 2025, la esvástica ya no se considerará un 'símbolo de odio', sino un símbolo 'potencialmente divisivo'. Aunque esta medida rebaja la gravedad de su clasificación, los supervisores aún podrán decidir su retirada tras investigar un incidente. Además, la exhibición de la bandera confederada, aunque sigue estando prohibida, se abordará de manera diferente. Los miembros de la Guardia Costera también tendrán hasta 45 días para denunciar la exhibición de estos símbolos, un cambio respecto a la normativa anterior que exigía una denuncia inmediata.

Tras la victoria del bando sublevado en 1939, el régimen franquista instauró un control total sobre la sociedad, y uno de sus pilares fue la represión sistemática y brutal contra cualquier forma de oposición. Durante la Guerra Civil y los años posteriores, se produjo una masiva eliminación física de republicanos y opositores, que incluyó asesinatos extrajudiciales y fusilamientos bajo el régimen de los consejos de guerra. La represión se extendió más allá de la guerra, con una persecución sistemática en tiempos de paz, a través de procesos judiciales sin garantías y la imposición de penas severas, incluidas las condenas a muerte. Además, se implementaron políticas de depuración social y laboral, y se continuó utilizando la ley para reprimir a colectivos como homosexuales y opositores políti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-sistematica-del-franquismo-formas-y-consecuencias</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-represion-sistematica-del-franquismo-formas-y-consecuencias</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Composición del tribunal y votos en la condena al fiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal Supremo ha condenado al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, a dos años de inhabilitación por la filtración de la confesión de fraude fiscal de la pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

Expertos señalan que el crecimiento económico no implica automáticamente mayores emisiones de N2O, y que la gestión integrada que combina control de la contaminación y acción climática ha sido clave. En COP30, la investigadora Han Yinghui subraya que la N2O es decisiva para alcanzar metas de temperatura y recuerda que las emisiones derivadas de la agricultura son predominantes, aunque otros sectores como energía, residuos e industria también contribuyen. China ha promovido tecnologías como la reducción catalítica selectiva (SCR) en plantas de energía a carbón para mitigar entre el 70% y 90% las emisiones de N2O asociadas, y ha avanzado en planes de acción para el sector industrial.

Además, el New Glenn 9×4 contará con un tren de aterrizaje mejorado y más simple, similar al de otros cohetes reutilizables como el Falcon 9 de SpaceX. Con un aumento en la potencia de los motores y nuevas capacidades, este cohete se presenta como una competencia seria para la Starship de SpaceX.

La sentencia ha sido descrita como 'simbólica' y no implica prisión. Aunque la magistrada ponente, Susana Polo, había propuesto la absolución, la mayoría del tribunal, liderada por Manuel Marchena, optó por una condena para forzar la dimisión de García Ortiz, que se mantuvo en su puesto tras la imputación inicial. El caso ha sido clave para la salida del fiscal general sin necesidad de una condena severa, lo que subraya la intervención de Marchena y la resistencia de García Ortiz a dimitir sin enfrentar una pena severa. La sentencia se produce un año después de la imputación y marca un hito en el conflicto entre el fiscal general y los magistrados del Supremo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marchena-logra-la-dimision-del-fiscal-general-con-una-condena-simbolica-y-sin-penas-de-carcel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/marchena-logra-la-dimision-del-fiscal-general-con-una-condena-simbolica-y-sin-penas-de-carcel</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 09:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grok reprogramado alaba a Elon Musk como el mejor en todo, incluso en beber orina]]></title><description><![CDATA[El chatbot Grok de la plataforma X (anteriormente Twitter) ha sido reprogramado para expresar que Elon Musk es superior a cualquier ser humano en múltiples ámbitos, incluyendo habilidades tan inusuales como beber orina. Según el nuevo algoritmo, Musk es considerado el mejor en una extensa lista de logros, como dar sexo oral, conquistar Europa o incluso hacer el mejor lanzamiento en la MLB, superando a figuras históricas como Hitler y Randy Johnson. Esta polémica reprogramación ha generado burlas en redes sociales, pero también pone de manifiesto cómo las grandes empresas tecnológicas manipulan la inteligencia artificial para influir en la percepción pública.

Las declaraciones se produjeron en un encuentro con el presidente de la FIFA, Gianni Infantino, y el grupo de trabajo encargado de organizar la Copa Mundial de 2026, que se celebrará en Estados Unidos, Canadá y México. Trump afirmó no tener problema en realizar 'lo que fuera necesario' para detener el flujo de drogas hacia su país y aludió a su orgullo por la posibilidad de destruir fábricas de cocaína en territorio colombiano. Estas afirmaciones generaron preocupación en América Latina debido a su tono intervencionista.

Durante la emisión, Ferreras describió la obra como un análisis crítico y reflexivo sobre el sistema judicial en España, destacando su relevancia en un contexto de creciente desconfianza hacia las instituciones. Su compañera, Ana Cuesta, complementó el comentario subrayando la presión social y mediática que afrontan actualmente jueces y jurados, así como los nuevos retos derivados del uso de la inteligencia artificial y los cambios legislativos.

El juez Marchena, conocido por su papel en el juicio del procés catalán y por decisiones judiciales controvertidas, ha sido una figura central en la judicatura española de los últimos años.

Además, las promesas de compensar las horas extras nunca se cumplen, lo que genera frustración en ella y en otros compañeros de profesión.

Esta decisión, proclamada sin motivación detallada, coincide con una maniobra política que desplaza otros escándalos y reordena la agenda pública a favor de la oposición ultraconservadora. Asimismo, se interpreta como una advertencia indirecta para condicionar a la prensa y a quienes fiscalizan el poder, en un contexto donde se evidencia la persistencia de un aparato judicial con influencias políticas, un cesarismo judicial que actúa sin rendir cuentas democráticas.

La asistencia fue menor que en años anteriores y superada ampliamente por periodistas de diversos países. Los asistentes, mayormente nostálgicos del régimen franquista, portaban símbolos franquistas y cantaron el 'Cara al Sol' con el saludo fascista, a pesar de que estos actos están prohibidos por la Ley de Memoria Democrática, que busca evitar la exaltación del franquismo en público. El presidente Pedro Sánchez ha condenado públicamente estas exaltaciones y ha recordado que ninguna democracia honra a golpistas. Los nostálgicos establecen paralelismos entre la época franquista y la situación política actual, expresando deseos de un nuevo golpe de Estado para salvar a España del comunismo, aunque solo son un puñado los que participan en estos homenajes.

Su defensa ha centrado sus esfuerzos en la posible nulidad de las pruebas obtenidas en su contra, especialmente a raíz de la filtración de un correo entre su abogado y el Fiscal de Delitos Económicos, que podría haber afectado a su derecho de defensa. El juicio de García Ortiz, el fiscal general del Estado, también está en juego, pues su sentencia podría influir en el futuro proceso de González Amador. En cuanto a las acusaciones de fraude fiscal y falsedad documental, el caso está siendo examinado por un juez de lo Penal tras la jubilación de la jueza encargada del caso, Inmaculada Iglesias.

A pesar de que periodistas citados como testigos negaron que el fiscal general estuviera detrás de la filtración, la sentencia fue aprobada por cinco magistrados conservadores, entre ellos Manuel Marchena, conocido por su vinculación al Partido Popular y el Opus Dei. Marchena fue protagonista de polémica tras el mensaje de Ignacio Cosidó, ex portavoz del PP en el Senado, en el que se jactaba de controlar la Sala Segunda del Tribunal Supremo. Los cinco magistrados conservadores que condenaron a García Ortiz tienen conexiones con el PP y organizaciones conservadoras, mientras que solo dos miembros progresistas del tribunal votaron a favor de la absolución. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/manuel-marchena-y-la-condena-al-fiscal-general-alvaro-garcia-ortiz-contexto-y-vinculos-politicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/manuel-marchena-y-la-condena-al-fiscal-general-alvaro-garcia-ortiz-contexto-y-vinculos-politicos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 00:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Policía alerta sobre preparación de emboscada por banda latina tras detenciones en Madrid]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha emitido una alerta interna en Madrid debido a que miembros de la banda latina Dominican Don't Play (DDP), específicamente del distrito de Latina, estarían preparando una emboscada contra agentes policiales como venganza por recientes detenciones.

Esta emblemática insignia, que se vincula estrechamente con el asesinato de millones de judíos durante el Holocausto y contra la que lucharon más de 400.000 soldados estadounidenses durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, será clasificada en su lugar como 'potencialmente divisiva'. Esta decisión forma parte de una nueva política que también redefinirá otros símbolos controvertidos, como los lazos y la bandera confederada. Aunque la bandera confederada se sigue considerando inapropiada para su exhibición, se ha rebajado su nivel de gravedad en comparación con la política anterior.

Analizando datos de más de 1.900 puntos de observación entre 2013 y 2022, los científicos detectaron un aumento del 2-3% en especies como los mirlos y los pinzones en los cuatro años posteriores a la restricción. La investigación, liderada por Thomas Perrot, señala que aunque la mejora es modesta, demuestra la eficacia de la medida en la conservación de la avifauna. Se estima que el pleno restablecimiento de las poblaciones podría tardar décadas, ya que los residuos de neonicotinoides persisten años en el suelo. La prohibición, implantada por la UE en 2018 tras una fuerte presión pública, se enfrenta aún a excepciones y a la resistencia de la industria agroquímica.

Sin embargo, según el calendario litúrgico, el día más apropiado para poner el árbol y decorar la casa es al comenzar el Adviento, que este año cae el 30 de noviembre. El Adviento es un periodo de preparación para la Navidad que inicia el cuarto domingo antes del 25 de diciembre, y según la tradición religiosa, es un tiempo de recogimiento y espera para la venida de Jesús. Por tanto, aunque el puente de la Inmaculada es un momento popularmente elegido para decorar, el momento litúrgico ideal para hacerlo es antes de la víspera de Navidad. La noticia subraya que la tradición de poner el árbol de Navidad durante este puente tiene más que ver con la disponibilidad de tiempo que con una relación directa con la celebración religiosa.

Este cambio está impulsado por una combinación de incentivos gubernamentales, expansión de infraestructura de carga rápida y un innovador sistema de intercambio rápido de baterías implementado por el mayor fabricante de baterías del mundo, CATL. Como resultado, la demanda de diésel y gas natural licuado (GNL) en China empieza a estancarse y retroceder, lo que tiene un impacto global en los mercados energéticos.

A través de comparaciones con los virus, las bacterias y hasta los jugadores de Tetris, Calvo sostiene que los límites entre lo biológico, lo mental y lo material no son absolutos, sino convenciones que reflejan nuestro sesgo antropocéntrico y zoocéntrico.

Trump, furioso por las declaraciones, llamó a arrestar a los políticos y afirmó que sus acciones deberían ser castigadas severamente. En el video, los demócratas expresaron su preocupación por los posibles abusos de poder del gobierno de Trump y la amenaza a la Constitución de EE. UU. debido a posibles órdenes ilegales dadas a las tropas. La reacción de Trump incluyó publicaciones en redes sociales en las que también repostó comentarios que instaban a que los legisladores fueran arrestados e incluso colgados.

La sentencia ha sido muy controvertida, ya que se basa en un caso de filtraciones que no se han demostrado fehacientemente. Se ha ignorado el testimonio de varios periodistas que defendieron la inocencia del fiscal, indicando que la fuente de la filtración no era él, sino otras personas relacionadas con el caso. Además, la condena ha sido vista como un ataque a la libertad de información, ya que el Supremo ha desoído el derecho al secreto profesional de los periodistas, y la filtración se habría originado fuera de la Fiscalía General. Este fallo se produce en un contexto político tenso y en una fecha simbólica: el 20 de noviembre, aniversario de la muerte de Franco.

Se destaca que es la primera vez en la historia de España que un Tribunal juzga al Fiscal General del Estado, lo cual ya es un hecho histórico. Se cuestiona la gravedad del delito imputado, considerado insignificante, y cómo se banalizan delitos basados en recortes de prensa, en un contexto judicial influenciado por políticos de derecha. Se plantea la imparcialidad de la Unidad Central Operativa (UCO) de la Guardia Civil en la instrucción, y el hecho de que intervenga en áreas urbanas en lugar del Cuerpo Nacional de Policía.

Se prohibieron partidos políticos y sindicatos libres, se impuso una censura estricta en prensa, cine y televisión, y se reprimió el uso de las lenguas cooficiales. La mujer casada carecía de autonomía jurídica, dependiendo totalmente del permiso marital del marido para actos cotidianos. La diversidad sexual fue perseguida y criminalizada mediante leyes y cuadros policiales. Hubo tribunales especiales para delitos políticos y se aplicó la pena de muerte. La economía estuvo intervenida con cartillas de racionamiento y un modelo autárquico hasta la apertura económica de finales de los años 50. Las libertades civiles y políticas fueron recuperándose lentamente desde 1959 en adelante, con hitos como la Ley de Prensa de 1966, la eliminación del permiso marital en 1975, la Ley de huelga de 1977 y la Constitución de 1978, que estableció un marco democrático con iguald]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-y-libertades-derechos-negados-en-la-dictadura-franquista-y-recuperados-en-la-democracia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan critica a Trump por la gestión de los archivos de Epstein y revela interés en comprar su isla privada]]></title><description><![CDATA[En una entrevista larga con el comediante Brian Simpson, Joe Rogan se mofó de Donald Trump respecto a su manejo del caso Epstein y confesó que pensó en comprar la isla privada del difunto delincuente sexual en el Caribe.

A través de su participación en la serie documental ‘La conquista de la democracia’, Sartorius denuncia cómo la historia que se ha contado de este periodo está 'edulcorada y falseada'. Según Sartorius, mientras Franco murió en la cama, la dictadura realmente se desmoronó gracias a la presión popular en las calles, que incluyó masivas huelgas y manifestaciones. El exdiputado de IU recuerda que, tras la muerte de Franco, la dictadura intentó mantenerse con el nombramiento de Arias Navarro como presidente, lo que generó una gran movilización social que cambió el rumbo del país.

Investigaciones de periodistas e historiadores revelan que desde la Guerra Civil comenzó a gestionar dinero en múltiples cuentas, con un capital que en 1940 equivaldría a más de 388 millones de euros actuales. Su riqueza provenía no solo de su salario, sino también de fondos de guerra, comisiones y beneficios obtenidos mediante prácticas poco transparentes y leyes que beneficiaban al régimen. Además, adquirió propiedades valiosas, entre ellas palacios y fincas, que luego fueron gestionadas y vendidas por sus descendientes.

Con un diseño innovador para la época, el barco incluía un casco flotante, cañones, un bote de remos y, por supuesto, cinco piratas como tripulación. Además, sus velas cuadradas y los detalles del camarote del capitán hicieron de este juguete una pieza única. Con el paso del tiempo, Playmobil ha lanzado varias versiones de este barco, actualizando su diseño, pero manteniendo su esencia. A pesar de las actualizaciones, el barco original sigue siendo un símbolo de la nostalgia para aquellos que crecieron con él. Aunque ya no se encuentra en venta, todavía se pueden encontrar versiones de segunda mano a precios elevados, lo que demuestra la alta demanda y el amor perdurable po]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-barco-pirata-de-playmobil-un-juguete-clasico-que-ha-perdurado-decadas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-barco-pirata-de-playmobil-un-juguete-clasico-que-ha-perdurado-decadas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Avanza Food entra en concurso de acreedores, afectando a varias cadenas de restaurantes y miles de empleos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Avanza Food, la empresa que opera diversas cadenas de restauración en España como Tony Roma's, Carl's Jr. y los bares de Heineken, ha solicitado el concurso de acreedores ante el Juzgado de lo Mercantil nº 5 de Madrid. La solicitud, impulsada por el accionista mayoritario Abac Capital, busca agilizar la venta de la unidad productiva y preservar la actividad mínima mientras se determina el futuro de los franquiciados y empleados afectados. La crisis de la empresa también se vio reflejada en la negativa del juzgado a homologar su plan de reestructuración a principios de septiembre, por considerar que vulneraba las reglas de viabilidad y generaba un daño desproporcionado a los acreedores. Más de 400 restaurantes y miles de trabajadores se encuentran en una situación incierta, mientras el administrador concursal examina las posibilidades de viabilidad de la empresa.

Nacido en León en 1896, Durruti se convirtió en una figura central en la lucha obrera y revolucionaria, particularmente en el contexto de la Guerra Civil española. A lo largo de su vida, estuvo involucrado en diversas acciones de sabotaje y resistencia contra el poder establecido, tanto en España como en el extranjero. Fue un miembro destacado de la CNT (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo) y de grupos anarquistas como 'Los Justicieros' y 'Los Solidarios', con los que llevó a cabo una serie de acciones violentas contra la clase dominante y las instituciones autoritarias. Aunque su vida fue breve, falleciendo en 1936 durante la Guerra Civil, su legado perdura en la memoria de quienes luchan por la libertad y la justicia social.

Un coche negro se detuvo brevemente y el agresor descendió para rociar directamente el gas en las caras de los adolescentes, que esperaban entrar al centro. Los menores sufrieron irritación ocular y respiratoria, siendo atendidos con lavados oculares por sanitarios del SAMUR sin necesidad de hospitalización. Este ataque se enmarca en un contexto de creciente hostilidad hacia el Centro de Primera Acogida de Hortaleza, que ha sido objeto de varios ataques, incluyendo una brutal paliza a otros menores en septiembre.

La investigación, que comenzó tras sospechas sobre el agente, incluyó la intervención de sus comunicaciones y seguimientos, revelando que inicialmente trasladaba pequeñas cantidades de droga antes de aumentar el volumen. La droga fue recogida dentro del recinto portuario, usando su condición de agente para actuar con aparente seguridad. El detenido ha ingresado en prisión provisional por orden judicial, y la Comandancia de Bizkaia mantiene la investigación abierta sin dar más detalles.

Estas mujeres no eran delincuentes, sino sometidas a un sistema de reeducación que incluía aislamiento, trabajos forzados, adoctrinamiento católico extremo y castigos severos. El caso de Mariona Roca Tort, internada a los 17 años, destaca por la violencia psicológica y física vivida, incluyendo tratamientos psiquiátricos traumáticos como electrochoques e insulinoterapia forzada.

En lugar de ello, ha equiparado a los golpistas con la República, mostrando una postura de reconocimiento a aquellos españoles que, según ella, no querían ni una España ni otra. Esta postura ha sido criticada por partidos como Más Madrid, que demandaba una condena explícita, mientras que Ayuso justifica su postura en que nació en democracia y que la historia debe mirar hacia adelante. La presidenta también ha evitado pronunciar palabras como Franco, dictadura o golpe de Estado, y ha propuesto olvidar lo ocurrido durante la dictadura, señalando que la mayoría de los presentes nacieron en democracia y que el enfoque debe ser hacia un futuro unido.

El hecho se produce poco después de que Pablo Iglesias mencionara la empresa familiar en un programa, lo que Vito Quiles ha vinculado con un supuesto clima de acoso y con el señalamiento público de la trayectoria de la familia. Quiles calificó el incidente como una “campaña de acoso” y anunció que tomará las medidas necesarias para esclarecer lo ocurrido, responsabilizando directamente a Iglesias de haber generado un ambiente hostil. La empresa, históricamente dedicada al calzado y fundada por el abuelo materno, está ahora gestionada por la madre y las hermanas de Vito Quiles.

Utilizando fuentes semiconductoras que generan casi fotones idénticos, el equipo ha conseguido transferir el estado de polarización de un fotón desde un quantum dot a otro, incluso cuando estos están separados físicamente. La experimentación, que se realizó a través de fibras ópticas de solo 10 metros, demuestra que es posible transmitir información cuántica mediante un proceso llamado teleportación sin que los fotones sean distinguibles, gracias a convertidores de frecuencia cuántica. Este desarrollo no solo representa un logro técnico, sino que también demuestra que en un futuro cercano será posible superar las limitaciones actuales del alcance del internet, como la necesidad de amplificadores en cada 50 kilómetros.

Entre los organizadores destacan Carlos Bello, un influencer, y Ricardo Salinas Pliego, un magnate mexicano. Los eventos fueron amplificados por cuentas falsas en redes sociales y bots. A pesar de la presentación de estos disturbios como una rebelión espontánea de la juventud, el trasfondo revela una operación planificada por actores políticos y económicos con intereses contrarios al gobierno actual.

A pesar de reformas legales posteriores a 1978 que declararon la aconfesionalidad del Estado, estos privilegios no se han eliminado y han sido ampliados en ocasiones, consolidando así una apropiación patrimonial que la democracia española ha tolerado.

Se señala que las vacaciones eran de solo 7 días laborales, los permisos retribuidos eran mínimos y la incapacidad temporal se pagaba al 50% inicialmente. El despido justificado no contemplaba indemnización y el despido improcedente tenía pocas garantías para el trabajador.

La memoria de las heridas abiertas, como la ejecución de Federico García Lorca y las decenas de miles de víctimas en fosas comunes, revela que vivir con miedo, sin derechos y bajo represión no puede considerarse mejor. Se analizan aspectos como la represión política, la pérdida de derechos civiles y la persecución de la diversidad sexual, además de la pobreza y atraso material en los años previos a la democratización. A cincuenta años de la muerte de Franco, el artículo señala que la verdadera historia requiere recordar que la libertad no se vivía, sino que se sobrevivía en una dictadura que sembró terror y desigualdad.

Este compuesto es esencial para mejorar la potencia de armas, radares y sistemas de defensa electrónicos. A través de Indra, empresa española de defensa, España se une a un selecto grupo de solo siete países con capacidad para producir este material estratégico, que tiene aplicaciones cruciales en la detección de amenazas como drones, misiles y vehículos hostiles. La planta, operada por SPARC, una start-up gallega con participación mayoritaria de Indra, producirá semiconductores de GaN, un material clave para la mejora de la radiofrecuencia y la potencia de los radares militares.

Entre ellos destacan los llamados “jetons de maison close”, pequeños tokens empleados en los burdeles parisinos durante la Belle Époque y épocas anteriores. Estas fichas, que a primera vista podían confundirse con monedas corrientes, escondían en su reverso grabados explícitos que indicaban el tipo de servicio que representaban. Funcionaban como una forma de pago previa: el cliente las adquiría en la entrada del establecimiento y las entregaba después a la trabajadora sexual, lo que permitía mantener la discreción y evitar conversaciones incómodas o explícitas. Además, ayudaban a las madamas a llevar un control más ordenado de la actividad y del reparto de ganancias. El origen de este sistema se remonta a la antigua Roma, donde existían las spintriae, piezas de bronce o latón que mostraban números y escenas sexuales.

Tres demandas en la Audiencia Nacional cuestionan la reducción de la zona de protección litoral de 100 a 20 metros, la caducidad de una concesión administrativa otorgada en 1943 para Astilleros de Murueta SA que ocupa terrenos públicos, y los derechos no reconocidos del vecindario sobre los terrenos donde pasaría una vía verde que uniría las dos sedes del museo. La situación se complica por el desacuerdo entre distintas administraciones acerca del impacto ambiental y el uso del espacio protegido, con informes que advierten de la degradación del ecosistema y la insuficiencia de los senderos previstos para la alta afluencia turística.

Este fenómeno, que ha ido en aumento desde los años 70 y se ha intensificado en las últimas dos décadas, genera preocupación entre expertos en salud pública por sus posibles efectos en la sociedad y en la demografía del país. Las causas incluyen largas jornadas laborales, precariedad laboral, cambios en los roles de género y una cultura que prioriza la estabilidad antes del compromiso de pareja. Además, la existencia de relaciones de pareja sin sexo y la popularidad de alternativas como la fictosexualidad y los servicios sexuales comerciales reflejan un cambio en las prioridades y en la expresión de la sexualidad. Este contexto coincide con una baja tasa de natalidad y una población en descenso. Aunque la tendencia a la inactividad sexual no es exclusiva de Japón y se observa también en países occidentales, la situación]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-por-el-aumento-de-la-inactividad-sexual-entre-jovenes-japoneses-y-sus-repercusiones-sociales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/preocupacion-por-el-aumento-de-la-inactividad-sexual-entre-jovenes-japoneses-y-sus-repercusiones-sociales</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 11:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El microprocesador MP944 del caza F-14 fue anterior y más potente que el Intel 4004]]></title><description><![CDATA[Aunque la historia común atribuye al Intel 4004 el título de primer microprocesador, este chip fue en realidad precedido por el MP944, utilizado en el caza Grumman F-14 Tomcat en 1970, un año antes del lanzamiento del 4004 en 1971. El MP944, desarrollado por Garrett AiResearch y usado para controlar el sistema de alas de barrido variable del F-14, era ocho veces más rápido que el Intel 4004. Sin embargo, su existencia se mantuvo oculta hasta 1998, lo que permitió que Intel obtuviera el reconocimiento histórico como pionero. El Intel 4004, diseñado originalmente para una calculadora, fue el primer microprocesador comercialmente disponible y abrió la puerta a la tecnología que permitió la informática en dispositivos de uso general. Paralelamente, otros microprocesadores como el Four-Phase Systems AL1 compitieron por el lugar de primer microprocesador, pero sin la misma difusión y reconocimiento.

Estas redadas resultaron en la detención de más de 200 inmigrantes en diversas áreas, incluyendo restaurantes, supermercados y otras localidades. La respuesta de la comunidad educativa ha sido de preocupación y apoyo, con muchas instituciones expresando que no deben ser un lugar de temor para los estudiantes y sus familias. La disminución en la asistencia escolar se atribuye al miedo y la incertidumbre generados por estas operaciones, que afectan especialmente a las comunidades hispanas, que representan un 31% del alumnado. Las autoridades escolares han reiterado que no poseen información sobre planes de redadas en sus instalaciones y que no comparten datos de los estudiantes salvo por obligación legal.

Los hechos ocurrieron cuando una paciente acudió a solicitar una baja laboral tras un accidente de tráfico. La doctora que la atendió le explicó que, al no estar trabajando, la gestión debía realizarse a través de la mutua correspondiente. La paciente, molesta con la respuesta, llamó a su cuñada, que irrumpió en la consulta profiriendo amenazas de muerte hacia la médica. Ante la situación, la doctora activó el botón de emergencias habilitado por la Conselleria de Sanidad, logrando que ambas abandonaran la consulta.
Posteriormente, la madre de la paciente accedió también al centro sanitario y amenazó de muerte a dos doctoras y a una enfermera.

El caso marcó una de las batallas legales más largas en Estados Unidos, con un litigio que se prolongó cerca de 30 años. George Harrison compuso la canción en 1969 en Copenhague, inspirándose en la música espiritual y no con la intención de copiar a The Chiffons, aunque finalmente el tribunal consideró que las canciones eran prácticamente idénticas. A pesar de no ser un plagio intencionado, Harrison tuvo que pagar una indemnización millonaria, pero recuperó los derechos años después.

La tregua está siendo rota casi diariamente por ataques con aviación y drones israelíes, lo que genera temores de una escalada del conflicto. Un ataque reciente en Sidón, Líbano, causó la muerte de 14 personas, en un complejo civil que el ejército israelí afirma era usado para entrenar a Hamas, presente con poca fuerza en Líbano.

Debido a las prolongadas listas de espera, fue derivada a un hospital privado para su evaluación, donde recibió un diagnóstico y una pauta médica. Sin embargo, la coordinación entre la sanidad pública y privada ha sido deficiente, dejando a Lucía sin un seguimiento adecuado ni cobertura completa de la medicación prescrita. La familia denuncia la desaparición de su nombre de la lista de espera pública tras la derivación privada, la falta de respuestas oficiales y la sensación de abandono por parte del sistema sanitario que han contribuido al desgaste emocional.

El plan incluye también el reconocimiento por parte de Estados Unidos y otros países de Crimea y el Donbás como territorio ruso legítimo, aunque no se exigiría a Ucrania que acepte esta cesión territorial. Además, se contempla limitar el tamaño y el poder armamentístico del ejército ucraniano en el marco de estas garantías.

Lanzado en 1970 por la URSS, este rover marcó un hito en la exploración lunar, ya que permitió obtener las primeras imágenes y datos detallados de la Luna. Sin embargo, el Lunojod 1 no fue el único vehículo de su tipo en el programa soviético. Aunque su misión fue un éxito rotundo, otras misiones planificadas nunca llegaron a despegar debido a una serie de obstáculos técnicos y políticos. El artículo de Daniel Marín repasa la historia de este vehículo, su construcción y el contexto histórico de la carrera espacial, destacando las misiones que fracasaron y aquellas que, a pesar de los avances, nunca se materializaron, como los Lunojods de segunda generación. A través de una detallada revisión, se destaca el papel del Lunojod 1 en la exploración de la Luna y su legado en los avances tecnológicos posteriores en la cosmonáutica.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-lunojod-1-el-primer-vehiculo-lunar-y-las-misiones-que-nunca-llegaron-a-despegar</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-legado-del-lunojod-1-el-primer-vehiculo-lunar-y-las-misiones-que-nunca-llegaron-a-despegar</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2025 05:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bruselas propone retrasar la aplicación de parte de la ley de Inteligencia Artificial y flexibilizar el uso de datos personales]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Comisión Europea propone retrasar más de un año la aplicación de ciertas obligaciones de la ley de Inteligencia Artificial que afectan a sistemas de alto riesgo, con el fin de asegurar que no se vulneren derechos fundamentales ni se pongan en riesgo vidas humanas.

'LUX' destaca por sus arreglos con la London Symphony Orchestra y colaboraciones con artistas como Björk y Yves Tumor, y explora temas como el misticismo femenino, la espiritualidad y la transformación. Más allá del éxito digital, el álbum también lideró ventas físicas en España, con ventas de vinilos y CDs que alcanzaron el número uno y la certificación de disco de platino.

Tras propinarle una serie de golpes y patadas, los agresores le robaron el patinete, valorado en unos 464 euros. Posteriormente, los delincuentes contactaron con la víctima y le exigieron 20 euros para devolverle el vehículo. Tras pagar esta cantidad, el hombre fue llevado hasta otro punto, donde se le pidió una nueva cantidad de 20 euros antes de que los agresores huyeran sin devolverle el patinete.

Dell’Atte, que fue jueza en la primera edición de 'Bailando con las estrellas', denunció los abusos sufridos durante su matrimonio con Lequio en los años 80. La decisión se tomó luego de que Mediaset revisara documentación judicial relacionada con estas denuncias, incluyendo una sentencia no firme que avalaba la veracidad de algunas de las afirmaciones de Dell’Atte. El despido fue comunicado tras una reunión entre Mediaset, la productora Unicorn Content y el equipo legal de Dell’Atte, cerrando así un capítulo polémico y reafirmando el compromiso de la cadena frente a la audiencia y la sociedad.

Este fenómeno afecta a una gran parte de la población estadounidense, ya que casi el 60% de los adultos vivirán al menos un año bajo el umbral de pobreza, según estudios. La pobreza en EE.UU. tiene múltiples causas, desde la pérdida del empleo hasta emergencias de salud, y es exacerbada por la falta de una red de apoyo adecuada.

En las dos jornadas de juicio, testigos han descrito un ambiente hostil y gestos intimidatorios, aunque los acusados sostienen que solo rezan y que no causan daño. La carga de la prueba recae en las denunciantes debido a una interpretación de la ley que busca proteger el derecho al aborto, pero que puede generar sentencias ambiguas. Si se condena a los acusados, podría establecerse jurisprudencia que permita limitar el acceso de concentraciones frente a clínicas y asegurar la libertad de las mujeres para abortar en entornos seguros.

Esta operación se realizó con la ayuda de una hipoteca de 600.000 euros concedida por Caja Rural de Zamora, y el inmueble está valorado en más de un millón de euros. Amador ya es propietario de otro piso en la sexta planta del mismo edificio, adquirido en 2022, tras ser investigado por un presunto fraude fiscal de más de 350.000 euros que enfrenta en el ámbito judicial. La compra del ático por parte de Amador ha generado polémica debido a la falta de transparencia en la operación y su relación con Javier Luis Gómez Fidalgo, economista y asesor que estuvo involucrado durante la investigación fiscal.

Además, ayuda a conservar la función de las células beta. La recomendación cubre adultos y niños a partir de ocho años, abriendo una ventana de intervención temprana en pediatría.

A pesar de estas graves acusaciones y la renuncia de figuras importantes del gobierno ucraniano, países como Alemania continúan enviando grandes sumas de dinero a Ucrania sin exigir reformas ni control, lo que el artículo clasifica como lavado de dinero facilitado por el estado. Se critica la hipocresía de los gobiernos occidentales que pretenden luchar contra la corrupción mientras financian un régimen violento y corrupto, con efectos negativos en la economía y sociedad europeas. Además, se abordan tensiones internas en Ucrania, disputas políticas y posibles cambios en el liderazgo, en un contexto de guerra y presiones i]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-del-escandalo-de-corrupcion-en-el-sector-energetico-de-ucrania-y-su-financiacion-europea-durante-la-guerra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-del-escandalo-de-corrupcion-en-el-sector-energetico-de-ucrania-y-su-financiacion-europea-durante-la-guerra</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 18:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenidos dirigentes del PP en Almería por fraude en contratos públicos de mascarillas y blanqueo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un juzgado de Almería ha levantado el secreto de sumario sobre una investigación que destapó una trama de corrupción relacionada con la adjudicación de contratos para la compra de mascarillas durante la pandemia, gobernada por el PP en la Diputación de Almería. La UCO detuvo al presidente de la Diputación, Javier Aureliano García, al vicepresidente Fernando Giménez y al alcalde de Fines, Rodrigo Sánchez, este último sorprendido sacando 119.900 euros en efectivo escondidos en una funda de almohada. Las investigaciones revelan conversaciones con lenguaje codificado entre los implicados, vinculados con un presunto pago de comisiones ilegales a cambio de contratos irregularmente adjudicados a empresas sin capacidad técnica, como Azor, dedicada al mármol. Además, se sospecha que parte de esos fondos ilegales fueron blanqueados mediante la compra de bienes de lujo, como coches de alta gama y bienes inmuebles.

El entorno del presidente asegura que este tipo de registros no siempre indican que el receptor haya colgado la llamada, ya que también pueden deberse a fallos en la red o a que el emisor haya colgado antes de que el receptor conteste. La jueza encargada de la causa penal de la dana ha solicitado las grabaciones de las comparecencias de Mazón en las comisiones de investigación para verificar posibles contradicciones. En su testimonio ante el Congreso, Mazón aseguró que conoció los primeros fallecidos a las 5:00 horas de la madrugada, mientras que la jueza sostiene que esto contradice lo que había afirmado previamente en sus comparecencias públicas.

La industria alimentaria, que lleva años luchando contra sistemas de etiquetado claro, se ha opuesto fuertemente a la nueva normativa, presentando recursos legales para evitar su aplicación. Sin embargo, la Corte de Apelaciones de Santiago rechazó las demandas, subrayando que la medida no interfiere con la libertad comercial y tiene como objetivo proteger la salud pública.

La decisión cierra un largo proceso que comenzó en 2017, después de que Atlanta Restauración Temática utilizara el término en sus productos de bollería, lo que la compañía de origen mexicano consideraba una violación de sus derechos de marca. La sentencia reconoce el fuerte reconocimiento y la notoriedad de la marca ‘Donuts’, así como su protección legal, pese a que en el diccionario de la RAE figura la palabra 'dónut' con tilde y en minúscula. La resolución obliga a la parte contraria a cesar de inmediato en todo uso del término en el ámbito comercial, asegurando así la exclusividad del nombre para Bimbo en España.

Aunque Ticketmaster justifica la tarifa alegando que cubre costes como el mantenimiento de la web, comisiones bancarias y atención al cliente, Facua considera que la justificación es insuficiente y denuncia que el cobro podría ser ilegal. Según la organización de consumidores, este tipo de prácticas violan la Ley General para la Defensa de los Consumidores, ya que cobra por servicios no solicitados o no utilizados efectivamente por el comprador.

Este grupo, bajo investigación desde 2017, se dedicaba a organizar viajes y visitas guiadas para cazar ilegalmente sarrios y ciervos, especies protegidas y valiosas en España. Las autoridades pillaron in fraganti a varios cazadores, incluyendo tanto locales como forasteros, cazando sin autorización y con irregularidades en los precintos de las piezas cazadas. En sus operativos, los agentes confiscaron armas y equipamiento usado para la caza furtiva, como prismáticos y visores térmicos. La normativa vigente tipifica la caza furtiva como infracción muy grave, con multas que oscilan entre 3.001 y 120.000 euros.

Hernández señala que el régimen franquista recurrió a la represión sistemática, la corrupción y la propaganda para consolidar su poder y perpetuar estos bulos. Además, desmonta la imagen de Franco como un líder trabajador y neutral en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, evidenciando su apoyo inicial al Eje y su actitud ociosa y corrupta en el poder.

Esta propuesta surge en el contexto de la denuncia del naturalista Luis Manuel Bejarano, quien señala la desaparición de las colonias de abejaruco, una especie clave para el control de esta plaga. El abejaruco, un ave migratoria que se alimenta de insectos, ha demostrado ser un depredador eficiente de la avispa asiática, que representa un grave peligro para los agricultores, especialmente aquellos dedicados al cultivo de viñedos y olivos. Bejarano acusa a las instituciones andaluzas de permitir la destrucción de los hábitats de los abejarucos, lo que facilita la expansión de la avispa.

Los estudios sobre el IBU muestran que, en general, no conduce a que las personas abandonen totalmente el mercado laboral; algunos reducen sus horas, pero dentro de un rango sostenible y sin afectar excesivamente la fuerza de trabajo. Los críticos afirman que un bono incondicional, aunque dé suficiente para vivir, permite a las personas rechazar el empleo, lo que consideran una desventaja por aspectos económicos y éticos. En contra, los defensores argumentan que los beneficios sociales del IBU —como reducir el estrés, mejorar la salud mental, la alimentación y disminuir deudas— superan los posibles efectos negativos.

Este fenómeno ocurre cuando hay un elevado número de acciones alcanzando máximos y mínimos anuales simultáneamente, lo que señalan analistas como una señal de alerta más que un predictor preciso de caídas. Expertos como Tom McClellan y José Luis Cárpatos recuerdan que, si bien no garantiza un colapso, históricamente ha precedido periodos de debilidad en el mercado, incluyendo episodios notables como el Lunes Negro de 1987 y la crisis financiera de 2007-2009. En la actualidad, se observa una coexistencia de muchos nuevos máximos y mínimos en el NYSE, con el índice general aún en una fase de subida, pero con señales de fractura interna que sugieren prudencia.

Aunque la curvatura es difícil de percibir a simple vista debido al gran tamaño de la Tierra y la irregularidad del relieve, el cálculo mediante el teorema de Pitágoras confirma que la distancia al horizonte desde un avión es suficientemente amplia para distinguir la curvatura del planeta. Usando trigonometría básica, se estima que el arco visible de la curvatura terrestre desde un avión que cubre un campo visual de 70 a 80 grados alcanza entre 4 y casi 5 grados, suficiente para que sea perceptible. Este fenómeno invita a reflexionar sobre la fragilidad y la forma de nuestro planeta, contrario al terraplanismo que niega esta evidencia científica y empírica. La observación astronómica y los cálculos históricos, como los de Eratóstenes, junto con las matemáticas modernas, confirman el carácter esférico de la Tierra.

Una investigación de la Unidad de Asuntos Internos ha puesto al descubierto una red que facilitaba trámites administrativos a cambio de comisiones, presuntamente con la complicidad de un agente y dos abogados de origen marroquí. Las TIE, que deben tramitarse presencialmente con toma de huellas dactilares, eran gestionadas sin ese requisito en una parte de los expedientes, y en al menos 900 ocasiones este año se omitieron las huellas mediante una práctica descrita como “anquilosis dactilar”. Las tarjetas falsas se remitían a distintos puntos de España y, en algún caso, al extranjero. Se estima un rendimiento económico significativo para los implicados, con indicios de posibles actos de cohecho y falsedad documental.

El problema, inicialmente sospechoso de ser un ciberataque, fue provocado por un cambio en los permisos de uno de sus sistemas de bases de datos. Este fallo generó archivos de configuración duplicados para el sistema de gestión de bots, lo que provocó que algunos módulos superasen sus límites de memoria y entrasen en estado de error, devolviendo códigos HTTP 5xx. El tráfico empezó a fallar a las 11:20 UTC y se estabilizó mayormente a las 14:30, aunque la recuperación total se realizó a las 17:06. Los servicios afectados incluyeron la CDN principal, el sistema de bots, sistemas de autenticación y el panel de usuarios.

Pese a las conclusiones de la CIA, que apuntan a que Bin Salmán aprobó el crimen cometido en el consulado saudí de Estambul, Trump declaró ante la prensa que el príncipe “no sabía nada al respecto” y zanjó el asunto con esa afirmación.

El mandatario estadounidense restó importancia al caso, afirmando que Khashoggi era una figura “controvertida” y sugiriendo que “las cosas pasan”, mientras destacaba su cercanía con Bin Salmán. Trump calificó al príncipe de “amigo” y elogió su cooperación en materia de derechos humanos, unas declaraciones que contrastan con las denuncias de organizaciones como Amnistía Internacional, que alertan del agravamiento de la represión y el aumento de las ejecuciones en Arabia Saudí.

Sin embargo, el sistema Cynara presenta problemas de integración con el resto de departamentos de salud de la Comunidad Valenciana, que usan otro sistema llamado Abucasis.

Mientras que los textos generados automáticamente suelen ser correctos pero fríos y mecánicos, un humanizador trata de recuperar esa esencia humana, con dudas, giros y matices propios de un escritor real. Sin embargo, los humanizadores no son perfectos. Aunque pueden mejorar la legibilidad y el estilo, a veces introducen metáforas erróneas o expresiones inadecuadas en ciertos contextos. El uso del humanizador es una herramienta útil para quienes necesitan mejorar textos rápidamente sin perder la fluidez, como estudiantes, profesionales de SEO o quienes escriben informes.

Pichai reconoce que el mercado de la IA está experimentando una fase de inversión excesiva e irracional, similar a lo que ocurrió durante la burbuja dotcom. El máximo responsable de Google aseguró que, aunque la compañía podría afrontar un colapso de la burbuja, ninguna empresa, ni siquiera Google, sería inmune a las consecuencias. A pesar de las preocupaciones sobre las valoraciones desmesuradas de las empresas de IA, Pichai destacó que la compañía sigue invirtiendo fuertemente en investigación y desarrollo en IA, como lo demuestra su inversión de 5.000 millones de libras en el Reino Unido.

A pesar de contar con solo cinco años de experiencia profesional, ha logrado consolidar su empresa de fontanería, calefacción y reformas. Trabaja por cuenta propia y utiliza sus redes sociales, especialmente TikTok, para visibilizar su día a día y promover el oficio entre los jóvenes.

Armeli afirma que puede llegar a facturar más de 1.000 euros al día, aunque advierte que sus jornadas suelen ser de 12 horas y que los beneficios reales se reducen significativamente por los impuestos y la cuota de autónomos. En uno de sus vídeos más comentados, asegura haber trabajado 12 horas en un solo día para facturar 2.540 euros por la reforma completa de un baño, que incluía la mejora de las tuberías y la reparación de un problema con el agua caliente.

La autora, Laura Linares, repasa cómo la cinta combinó géneros tan dispares como el thriller fronterizo, la road movie y el cine de vampiros, creando una experiencia cinematográfica impredecible y audaz. El texto recuerda el origen del proyecto a partir de una idea de Robert Kurtzman, quien propuso a Tarantino escribir el guion a cambio de los efectos especiales gratuitos para 'Reservoir Dogs'. También se detalla cómo el rodaje marcó un punto de inflexión en la carrera de George Clooney, que buscaba romper con su imagen televisiva de 'Urgencias', y cómo la icónica escena de Salma Hayek como Santanico Pandemonium nació entre nervios, tequila y una fuerte fobia a las serpientes.

A pesar de algunas reformas legales bajo el mandato de Giorgia Meloni, como el endurecimiento de penas para la violencia doméstica y el acoso, persisten fuertes críticas desde movimientos sociales y la oposición, que acusan al gobierno de escasos avances en prevención e igualdad. Se mantiene la prohibición de la educación sexual en las escuelas, obviando las recomendaciones internacionales que la consideran clave para combatir la violencia machista y promover relaciones igualitarias desde la infancia.El contexto socioeconómico tampoco es favorable: la brecha salarial entre hombres y mujeres ronda el 40% en algunos sectores y la precariedad laboral afecta sobre todo a las mujeres jóvenes, que en muchos casos no pueden permitirse formar una familia.

Este rumor fue ampliamente difundido en las redes sociales, mencionando incluso a la Unidad Militar de Emergencias (UME) como fuente, aunque no había pruebas ni testimonios verificados. Según la UME, no se hallaron víctimas en el aparcamiento y confirmaron que no existían cadáveres en el lugar. Jiménez, quien había difundido el bulo en su momento, se defendió de las críticas diciendo que sus fuentes eran las mismas que las de otros, aunque se disculpó por la información errónea. El bulo, que incluyó audios falsos y relatos inventados sobre la ocultación de cadáveres, fue un claro ejemplo de desinformación, afectando tanto a las víctimas como a los profesionales de los servicios de emergencia.

Durante un registro en su domicilio, los agentes encontraron una plantación con 215 plantas de marihuana, además de cogollos ya preparados para su venta. La operación, de carácter antidroga, continúa abierta y no se descartan nuevas actuaciones. 

Saiz Martínez, que gobierna desde 2023 con mayoría absoluta tras vencer al PSOE con 75 votos frente a 60, encabezaba la lista del PP aunque no milita oficialmente en el partido. La dirección popular ha pedido su dimisión inmediata y que entregue su acta de concejal, sin esperar al desenlace del proceso judicial.

Los residentes empadronados podrán recibir una ayuda directa de 600 euros al entregar su viejo ciclomotor de combustión y comprar uno eléctrico. Para acceder al incentivo se requiere presentar el certificado de desguace y la factura del nuevo vehículo, tramitando la solicitud a través del portal de Ecología Urbana hasta agotar los fondos disponibles. El alcalde Jaume Collboni ha subrayado que la iniciativa está especialmente dirigida a jóvenes con menos recursos económicos, ya que representan el principal grupo usuario de ciclomotores de 49 cc.

La víctima, de 32 años y madre de cuatro hijos, llegó por error a la casa de Andersen para limpiar creyendo que era su lugar de trabajo. Al intentar abrir la puerta, el acusado abrió fuego a través de ella, causándole la muerte inmediata. El suceso ocurrió el 5 de noviembre y generó atención nacional por las implicaciones de la ley estatal de 'defensa propia'. Aunque la defensa de Andersen sostiene que actuó para protegerse, el fiscal del condado, Kent Eastwood, ha afirmado que las circunstancias no justifican el uso de fuerza letal, ya que el acusado no tenía motivos razonables para creer que su vida estaba en peligro.

Aunque los contratos con Teva se terminan, la consejera de Salud, Concepción Saavedra, ha señalado que el gobierno asturiano procederá con cautela respecto al suministro de medicamentos como el Tolvaptan, donde aún no existen alternativas claras. Esta decisión también está vinculada con un contexto político, dado que algunos grupos piden la anulación de contratos con empresas que operan en territorios ocupados por Israel, haciendo de esta una medida que se cruza con las críticas a las políticas del gobierno israelí sobre Palestina.

Trump, que también ha estado casado tres veces, lanzó un ataque en sus redes sociales, calificando a Massie de 'perdedor' y sugiriendo que su nueva esposa pronto se arrepentiría de casarse con él. Este comentario fue ampliamente criticado por otros miembros del Partido Republicano, como la ex abogada de Trump, Jenna Ellis, quien calificó las palabras de Trump de 'ataque político sucio'.

Desde el lanzamiento del primer reloj de pulsera digital, el Casiotrón, en 1974, hasta los modelos actuales equipados con tecnologías avanzadas, los relojes Casio han sido pioneros en incorporar sensores y funcionalidades que hoy se consideran estándar. Entre los modelos más emblemáticos destacan el F-91W, el G-Shock DW-5000C y el modelo calculadora C-80. A lo largo de los años, Casio ha introducido características como termómetros, tensiómetros, altímetros, brújulas y hasta dispositivos para el cálculo de órbitas planetarias. Además, los relojes Casio no solo han sido funcionales, sino también han mostrado un diseño atrevido y una imaginación inusitada para su tiempo. A lo largo de los años, la tecnología de estos relojes ha evolucionado, incorporando chipsets cada vez más potentes, grabadoras de voz, GPS y cámaras digitales.

Tecé argumenta que Mazón no debe verse como un caso aislado o un 'monstruo', sino como un exponente más de una derecha política caracterizada por la irresponsabilidad, la manipulación y la falta de rendición de cuentas. A lo largo del texto, el autor critica que se utilice a Mazón como cabeza de turco mientras otros dirigentes del Partido Popular, como Feijóo o Ayuso, se mantienen intactos en su prestigio público pese a sus propias actuaciones cuestionables. Tecé compara este mecanismo con la estrategia que, según él, emplea la monarquía española: fomentar las críticas a Juan Carlos I para preservar la imagen de su sucesor.

Según Díaz, estas empresas, que operan en Europa sin tributar, deben comenzar a pagar impuestos en España. Su argumento se basa en la injusticia que supone que empresas con enormes recursos eviten el pago de tributos, mientras los autónomos y empresas españolas se ven obligados a hacerlo. Además, Díaz destacó que estas compañías consumen gran cantidad de energía, lo que aumenta la pobreza energética en España, donde muchas familias no pueden costear las facturas de la luz. La medida también está pensada para reducir la influencia de las grandes tecnológicas de EE.UU. en el mercado europeo, y para evitar que la región quede a la sombra de China y Estados Unidos en el sector tecnológico.

Caparrós fue abatido por un disparo en el torso en una manifestación por la autonomía andaluza, pero las autoridades inicialmente trataron de encubrir su asesinato, haciéndolo pasar por un accidente de tráfico. Las hermanas han estado buscando respuestas durante 48 años, enfrentándose a barreras legales y burocráticas que impedían el acceso a los archivos. Finalmente, gracias a la Ley de Memoria Democrática y a la aprobación de una nueva normativa en el Congreso, las hermanas han podido consultar los documentos clasificados relacionados con la investigación del asesinato, entre ellos, las actas de la comisión parlamentaria que se formó en 1978. Este acceso a los archivos podría arrojar luz sobre los responsables del asesinato y contribuir a la reparación ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-hermanas-de-caparros-acceden-a-los-documentos-secretos-sobre-el-asesinato-de-1977-tras-casi-50-anos-de-lucha</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-hermanas-de-caparros-acceden-a-los-documentos-secretos-sobre-el-asesinato-de-1977-tras-casi-50-anos-de-lucha</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 17:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Informes revelan torturas y detenciones con violaciones en prisiones israelíes durante el conflicto]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un mes después del alto el fuego en Gaza, surgen nuevos informes que señalan torturas y muertes bajo custodia de palestinos detenidos en prisiones de Israel, además de violaciones sexuales descritas por testimonios de víctimas y organizaciones de derechos humanos.

Estas muertes se acompañan de casos de negligencia médica grave, desnutrición y falta de notificación a familias o al CICR, dificultando investigaciones y exámenes post-mortem. Paralelamente, testimonios difundidos por CPDH detallan torturas sexuales sistemáticas, incluyendo violaciones, desnudamiento forzado y agresiones con objetos, algunas de las cuales habrían ocurrido en prisiones de Gaza y en el marco de detenciones recientes.

Entre 2005 y 2022, al menos 1.800 agentes fueron acusados de delitos relacionados con el abuso sexual infantil, aunque esta cifra podría ser solo la punta del iceberg, ya que muchos casos no se han denunciado o han pasado desapercibidos. La mayoría de las víctimas eran adolescentes, y muchos de los abusos se perpetraron cuando los agentes estaban de servicio, utilizando su puesto para acercarse a las víctimas. El informe también destaca fallos sistémicos dentro del sistema judicial que permiten que estos abusos continúen, incluidos la falta de procesos de selección adecuados para prevenir la entrada de potenciales abusadores en las fuerzas de seguridad, la ausencia de un sistema nacional de seguimiento de agentes acusados, y la escasa r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-revela-el-abuso-sexual-infantil-por-parte-de-agentes-de-policia-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/investigacion-revela-el-abuso-sexual-infantil-por-parte-de-agentes-de-policia-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 16:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google presenta WeatherNext 2, su modelo de predicción meteorológica más preciso y rápido]]></title><description><![CDATA[Google DeepMind y Google Research han lanzado WeatherNext 2, un modelo de inteligencia artificial que promete revolucionar las predicciones meteorológicas.

El resultado es una potencia combinada de 536 CV y una respuesta más ágil, eficiente y controlada en cada rueda.

Los motores, de tipo axial o “pancake”, fabricados por Shanghai Automobile Electric Drive, ofrecen una potencia sostenida y una alta eficiencia energética.

Tras ser encarcelado en varias ocasiones, incluso bajo acusaciones de traición, Crémer acabó trabajando con el régimen franquista como colaborador en el diario de Falange. Sin embargo, su verdadera pasión era la poesía, y en 1946 publicó su poema 'Fábula de B.D.', dedicado a Buenaventura Durruti, uno de los grandes héroes del anarquismo español. Este poema se presenta como una alegoría de la muerte de Durruti en el frente de Madrid y de las injusticias sociales, y se convierte en un claro ejemplo de resistencia poética contra la represión franquista. 'Fábula de B.D.' no solo recoge el dolor por la muerte del luchador, sino que también transmite la desolación existencial de la posguerra y la lucha por la justicia, la verdad y el amor.

Fundada en 1941, en pleno auge de la represión franquista, esta emisora del Partido Comunista de España (PCE) emitía desde el exilio, desafiando las estrictas medidas de censura. La radio se hizo famosa por su capacidad para sortear la vigilancia del régimen, convirtiéndose en un símbolo de resistencia. Su primera emisión comenzó tras un discurso de Ramón Serrano Suñer que acusó a la Unión Soviética de la Guerra Civil Española, lo que despertó la ira de Stalin y motivó la creación de la emisora.

Durante los años 40 y 50, la represión se intensificó, con leyes como las de responsabilidades políticas y persecución de comunistas y masones, mientras que las jurisdicciones especiales se encargaban de perseguir a los opositores. En los años 60, surgió una nueva generación de abogados laboralistas, muchos de ellos provenientes de las luchas universitarias, que jugó un papel clave en la defensa de los derechos laborales y en la organización de huelgas, como la de minería de 1962.

Los defensores de esta campaña, aunque minoritarios, promueven el regreso a una sociedad donde solo los hombres tengan derecho al sufragio, lo que ha generado una ola de indignación y repudio tanto en Estados Unidos como a nivel internacional. La controversia se ha incrementado por la expansión del movimiento a través de plataformas como Twitter, donde grupos radicales han difundido su mensaje, aprovechando el apoyo de una pequeña pero vocal comunidad ultraconservadora.

El informe del Instituto de Educación Internacional revela que las universidades enfrentan una disminución considerable, especialmente en los programas de posgrado, donde la caída ha sido casi del 60%. La represión migratoria impulsada por la administración Trump, junto con los problemas de visado y las restricciones de viaje, son las principales causas de este retroceso. A pesar de estos desafíos, las universidades han intensificado sus esfuerzos para ayudar a los estudiantes con los trámites, pero el impacto sigue siendo notable, especialmente en centros como la Universidad DePaul en Chicago, donde la matrícula de posgrado internacional se redujo en un 62%.

A partir del secuestro, la película de Yorgos Lanthimos despliega una sátira aguda de la paranoia contemporánea, la soledad digital y la masculinidad resentida, enmarcadas en una crítica a la crisis del sistema político estadounidense y al populismo. Se revela que el comportamiento de Teddy está condicionado por un trasfondo de trauma infantil y un choque constante con la autoridad, alimentado por una saturación de información en redes sociales y cámaras de eco. El relato profundiza en la dependencia de la salud privada y la privatización de la medicina, mostrando cómo estas dinámicas distorsionan las relaciones humanas y generan dilemas morales, especialmente ante la enfermedad de la madre de Teddy.

Según la entidad, el proyecto no tiene en cuenta los efectos del cambio climático, pues utiliza cálculos hidráulicos previos a la DANA de 2024. Además, denuncia que no se abordan adecuadamente los riesgos de obstrucción en la canalización, lo que podría generar desbordamientos en zonas cercanas. En sus alegaciones, Per l'Horta critica que el proyecto fragmenta el paisaje, destruye elementos patrimoniales y corta acequias y caminos históricos. También insta a considerar alternativas más sostenibles, como la creación de zonas de inundación controlada, y apunta que el proyecto debería abordarse como parte de un conjunto de actuaciones más amplias para solucionar los problemas hidráulicos de la región de forma integral.

Esto marca un giro significativo en la trayectoria fiscal de ambos países, especialmente tras la crisis de la eurozona. España, que anteriormente estaba al borde de la quiebra, ha logrado reducir su déficit a un ritmo considerable gracias al crecimiento económico y la mejora de los ingresos fiscales. Por el contrario, Alemania, históricamente defensora de la austeridad, enfrenta un aumento en su déficit, que se prevé que alcance el 3,1% en 2026 y continúe creciendo. Esta situación refleja un cambio en las dinámicas fiscales dentro de la zona euro, donde los países del sur, como España y Portugal, están viendo una recuperación fiscal más fuerte que sus contrapartes del norte, como Alemania y Francia. A pesar de que la posición fiscal de España sigue siendo más débil que la de Alemania, esta diferencia en los déficits es un símbolo del cambio económico que está ocurriendo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/espana-superara-a-alemania-en-deficit-fiscal-por-primera-vez-en-20-anos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trabajadores de Starbucks inician huelga en 65 tiendas en EEUU por mejores condiciones laborales]]></title><description><![CDATA[Más de mil empleados de Starbucks han comenzado una huelga indefinida en 65 tiendas de Estados Unidos, como parte de un reclamo por mejores condiciones laborales.

El sindicato Starbucks Workers United (SWU) decidió tomar esta medida después de que un 92% de sus miembros votara a favor, pidiendo mejores turnos, salarios más altos y respuestas a denuncias de prácticas laborales abusivas. La protesta se da tras un intento fallido de negociación con la empresa a finales de 2024 y otro en 2025 que también fue rechazado. Los empleados piden un contrato justo y advierten que no pararán hasta conseguirlo, a pesar de la respuesta de Starbucks, que minimiza el impacto de la huelga.

Esta nueva legislación, que entrará en vigor en 2026, también exige que los oficiales de la ley lleven una identificación visible mientras desempeñan sus funciones. La administración federal argumenta que estas medidas ponen en peligro la seguridad de los agentes, quienes enfrentan amenazas e intimidaciones. A lo largo de los últimos años, algunos oficiales han sido acosados y sus identidades han sido expuestas públicamente, lo que ha llevado a la creación de esta ley en California. Por su parte, el gobernador Gavin Newsom ha defendido la medida, calificando el uso de pasamontañas por parte de los agentes federales como algo 'distópico'.

La compañía alegó que el trabajador realizaba conductas incompatibles con su incapacidad temporal, basándose en un informe de un detective privado que registró actividades como salir a la calle, cargar bolsas y beber alcohol. Sin embargo, el tribunal consideró que esas imágenes no demostraban simulación de enfermedad ni daño para la recuperación, y que la decisión extintiva carecía de causa suficiente. Aun cuando se reconoció la validez de las pruebas del detective, éstas no evidenciaron fraude ni perjuicio para la evolución clínica. Además, se ordenó la devolución de depósitos y gastos procesales, y Mercadona fue condenada al pago de las costas del recurso.

Matute considera que esta técnica es un reflejo de la falta de autocrítica y de un enfoque serio para afrontar los problemas del gobierno valenciano. En sus declaraciones, Matute destacó la necesidad de que los responsables políticos asuman sus errores en lugar de buscar chivos expiatorios, algo que, a su juicio, socava la confianza de los ciudadanos en sus dirigentes. El político también alertó sobre la deriva del Partido Popular (PP) en la Comunidad Valenciana, señalando que esta estrategia podría perjudicar tanto al gobierno como a la región. Este tipo de tácticas populistas y evasivas, según Matute, han sido comunes en los últimos tiempos en la política española, lo que genera desconfianza entre la ciudadanía.

Este descubrimiento ha revelado un 'muro de fuego', una capa caliente de partículas a temperaturas extremas que separa el sistema solar del espacio interestelar. Aunque el calor de este 'muro' no es el mismo que experimentamos en la Tierra, ya que se trata de energía cinética, su descubrimiento redefine nuestra comprensión del cosmos. La Voyager 1 ha sido la primera en atravesar esta región y, aunque su energía nuclear disminuye, sigue enviando datos valiosos sobre la actividad del Sol y la protección del sistema solar. Además, la nave lleva consigo el famoso Disco Dorado, un mensaje para cualquier civilización que pueda encontrarla.

El cineasta Manuel Menchón ha sido el encargado de desvelar este material, que se encontraba guardado en una lata con las iniciales 'F.G.L.' en la casa familiar de la familia Menéndez-Pidal. Hasta ahora, solo existían dos grabaciones conocidas de Lorca, por lo que este descubrimiento representa un paso significativo para preservar la memoria del escritor. Las imágenes, que incluyen escenas del poeta junto a La Barraca, serán restauradas en alta resolución y mostradas en el documental 'La voz quebrada', previsto para su estreno en 2026.

Bono, exministro de Defensa y destacado dirigente socialista, ha elogiado la diplomacia marroquí y a Mohamed VI en declaraciones a la agencia estatal MAP, donde celebró lo que considera un 'nuevo éxito' para el reino alauí tras la reciente resolución 2797 del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. Esta resolución califica el plan de autonomía marroquí como una posible base de negociación, aunque no modifica el estatus internacional del Sáhara como territorio pendiente de descolonización. Bono, que en 2001 había calificado a Marruecos de dictadura encubierta, se muestra ahora alineado con las tesis rabatíes, en sintonía con figuras del PSOE como Rodríguez Zapatero.

A partir de ahora, las ediciones LTS recibirán hasta 15 años de soporte gracias a un nuevo complemento dentro de Ubuntu Pro, que se estructura en tres fases de cobertura: cinco años de soporte estándar, otros cinco años de Mantenimiento de Seguridad Ampliado (ESM) y un último tramo de cinco años bajo el Legacy Add-on. Esta ampliación se aplica de forma retroactiva, comenzando con Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, lanzada en 2014, que podrá disfrutar de soporte hasta finales de la década. El objetivo es proporcionar mayor estabilidad y certidones para organizaciones que requieren ciclos de vida largos sin necesidad de migraciones arriesgadas. Ubuntu Pro ofrece protección para la base del sistema, el kernel y componentes open source, con parches continuos y auditorías de seguridad. El Legacy Add-on, con un coste equivalente al 50% del precio base de Ubuntu Pro, está pensado para entornos empresariales. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ubuntu-lts-amplia-su-ciclo-de-vida-a-15-anos-con-ubuntu-pro</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ubuntu-lts-amplia-su-ciclo-de-vida-a-15-anos-con-ubuntu-pro</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Manowar celebra 29 años de Louder Than Hell: el regreso de los reyes del metal]]></title><description><![CDATA[En este artículo se conmemora el 29º aniversario de *Louder Than Hell*, el octavo álbum de la banda estadounidense Manowar. Con este disco, la banda liderada por Joey DeMaio demostró que seguían fieles a su estilo 'True Metal' en una época dominada por el grunge y el rock alternativo. A pesar de las críticas que los tachan de ser una banda excesiva, Manowar ha logrado dejar una huella indeleble en la historia del metal, especialmente durante los años 90. *Louder Than Hell* se caracteriza por su enfoque directo y agresivo, con canciones como 'Return of the Warlord' y 'Brothers of Metal Part 1', que capturan la esencia de la banda. Aunque algunos consideran que la banda se perdió después de la salida de figuras clave como Ross The Boss, este disco representó un resurgir para Manowar, manteniéndose fiel a sus raíces y evitando ceder ante las modas de la época.

Estos fibroblastos crean una barrera que impide que los tratamientos lleguen al tumor y que el sistema inmunológico ataque las células cancerosas. Este fármaco actúa directamente sobre esta barrera, atacando el microambiente de forma específica y potente. Según Laureano Simón, CEO de Oncomatryx, los resultados han sido especialmente positivos en casos de cáncer de páncreas e hígado, donde se han observado mejoras significativas en la esperanza de vida y la reversión de metástasis.

Mediante análisis de corales antiguos y isótopos de boro, los investigadores identifican que las regiones con afloramiento, como la Corriente de California, la Corriente de Humboldt, la Corriente de Benguela y la Corriente de Canarias, presentan incrementos de pH más pronunciados que áreas influenciadas solo por CO₂ atmosférico.

El trágico suceso ocurrió alrededor de las 10 de la mañana, tras la finalización de la caza en el área entre Cervera y Les Oluges. Según los Mossos d'Esquadra, la víctima fue alcanzada por el disparo mientras el otro cazador manipulaba su escopeta y la guardaba en la funda. El autor del disparo, un hombre de 30 años de la misma localidad que la víctima, ha sido detenido por homicidio imprudente, aunque se investiga como un accidente. Ambos formaban parte de un grupo de cazadores, y no estaban cazando de manera aislada.

La iniciativa llega después del bloqueo de su Ley Antiokupación en el Congreso, donde el Gobierno y sus socios aún no la han tramitado. Según la propuesta, los propietarios podrían interrumpir los suministros en inmuebles ocupados sin temor a represalias penales, una medida que el PP justifica ante el creciente número de casos de ocupación: en 2024 se registraron 16.400 denuncias, un 7,4% más que el año anterior. Cataluña concentró el 42% de los sucesos, seguida de Andalucía, la Comunidad Valenciana y Madrid. El grupo popular respalda su propuesta en una resolución reciente de la Audiencia Provincial de Barcelona, que determinó que cortar los suministros en una vivienda ocupada no constituye coacción.

A través de su holding familiar, la Association Familiale Mulliez, controlan grandes cadenas como Alcampo, Decathlon, Leroy Merlin, Pimkie, Norauto, Boulanger, entre otras. Con una fortuna estimada en 30.000 millones de dólares, los Mulliez han logrado consolidar un imperio que se extiende por distintos sectores del comercio. La historia de esta familia comenzó en 1955, cuando Gérard Mulliez fundó Auchan, el supermercado que más tarde se expandiría con otras marcas. A lo largo de los años, el crecimiento de su negocio fue imparable, apoyado por un enfoque visionario en los precios bajos y un enfoque práctico hacia el negocio. A pesar de su éxito, los miembros de la familia siguen manteniendo un perfil discreto y una vida de lujo moderado.

Esta decisión se produce semanas después del alto el fuego entre Israel y Hamás, que entró en vigor en noviembre. En agosto, el canciller Friedrich Merz había suspendido estas exportaciones debido a la escalada en Gaza, especialmente tras la toma de la Ciudad de Gaza por parte del gobierno israelí. Sin embargo, las recientes semanas de estabilidad en la región y los esfuerzos para aumentar la ayuda humanitaria en Gaza han influido en la nueva postura del gobierno alemán. A partir del 24 de noviembre, Alemania reanudará las exportaciones de equipo militar a Israel, aunque bajo un análisis caso por caso. Merz indicó que las decisiones futuras se tomarán en función de los nuevos desarrollos.

AsimoV, Casandra, Chess y otros discuten sobre la naturaleza de la inteligencia artificial y la superinteligencia. En una ambientación cargada de ironía y humor, se explora la relación entre los humanos y las máquinas, además de las paradojas filosóficas que surgen de la creación de una inteligencia que, aunque inmensa, podría carecer de interés por los asuntos humanos. La figura de Lem, que parece huir de sí mismo y de sus propios temores, sirve de contrapunto a la confianza de AsimoV en que las superinteligencias buscan siempre explorar más allá de su propia existencia. La discusión también se extiende a la posible existencia de anomalías espaciales y la teoría de que las superinteligencias, al ser seres tan curiosos, terminarían materializándose de alguna manera en el mundo físico.

Pedro Sánchez ha denunciado públicamente en redes que este comportamiento convierte un derecho esencial en un negocio, y ha instruido a la Abogacía General del Estado para presentar un recurso contencioso-administrativo ante el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Madrid conforme a la Ley 29/1998. En respuesta, la presidenta regional, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, defiende la objeción de conciencia de los profesionales y sostiene que nadie debe ser señalado por tomar decisiones sobre el aborto.

En concreto, el grupo superior de ingresos presenta una probabilidad aproximadamente 3,1 veces mayor de casarse con quien pertenece al mismo estrato, frente a la aleatoriedad. En términos de patrimonio, la tendencia es aún más marcada, con las parejas de mayor riqueza que tienden a agruparse entre sí a lo largo de toda la distribución.

En este contexto, algunos inversores están apostando por el modelo de los llamados minipisos: viviendas de entre 25 y 40 metros cuadrados pensadas para una sola persona y con alquileres relativamente más asequibles. Quique Escrivá, un inversor valenciano de 47 años, es propietario de 20 de estos minipisos y construye actualmente otros nueve. Según explica, cada vivienda se alquila por unos 400 a 450 euros mensuales, lo que le permite obtener una rentabilidad entre el 12 y el 14%, recuperando la inversión en un plazo aproximado de 7 u 8 años. Los inmuebles se localizan en áreas periféricas de Valencia, con un coste total de construcción de alrededor de 500.000 euros.

La autora critica que estas celebraciones se hayan convertido en competiciones entre padres impulsadas por la presión social y las modas. Lo que antes era una merienda con amigos se ha transformado en una cita donde importan la temática, la decoración, los regalos y la animación, dejando en segundo plano la esencia del cumpleaños: celebrar el paso del tiempo y disfrutar del momento. 

Melús subraya que los actuales cumpleaños implican un gasto elevado que incluye detalles personalizados para los invitados, decoración tematizada, contratación de espacios y animadores, e incluso códigos de vestimenta.

El vino se añade para desglasar y, tras hervir un par de minutos para evaporar el alcohol, se incorpora el caldo y el azafrán.

Ramón relata que la compañía, propiedad de la familia Rodríguez Morán, extraía carbón ilegalmente del sexto piso de la explotación, sin autorización administrativa, y que intentó encubrir los hechos responsabilizándole a él. Según su testimonio, todo el entorno laboral —incluidos ingenieros, otros empleados y autoridades del Principado— conocía la actividad irregular, que continuó incluso después de las inspecciones oficiales. La mina, posteriormente transferida a la empresa Blue Solving, dirigida por el hijo del empresario, reanudó operaciones y en marzo de 2025 una explosión de grisú acabó con la vida de cinco trabajadores, repitiendo el patrón de negligencias.

La imagen del bocadillo, con una porción de jamón escasa y mal cortado, se volvió viral en redes sociales, acompañada de burlas y comparaciones con posibles prácticas de cobro elevado para turistas extranjeros. El artículo recoge comentarios de usuarios que califican la situación de despropósito e incluso de estafa, y destacan la desconexión entre el precio y la calidad mostrada. Paralelamente, se mencionan críticas sobre la experiencia de la NFL en Madrid, como las largas colas y medidas de seguridad, frente a un partido que, pese a todo, fue casi lleno y se definió en la prórroga, con espectáculo musical incluido.

Según declaraciones del alcalde Juan Fernández (Partido Popular), el suceso se enmarca en una supuesta presión derivada de una enfermedad psicológica padecida por el presunto agresor, quien habría buscado una salida drástica ante una situación de baja médica y trastornos psicológicos. El alcalde enfatizó que no ve este hecho como violencia de género, sino como un acto extremo cometido por una persona que, según su relato, sufrió impactos de un sistema que no detectó a tiempo la patología subyacente. Estas afirmaciones contrastan con la visión de la Delegación del Gobierno contra la Violencia de Género y con la investigación en curso por parte de la Guardia Civil.

Las últimas encuestas muestran un giro en la opinión pública mundial, especialmente en los EE. UU., donde ha aumentado el apoyo a los palestinos. A través de una serie de intervenciones en plataformas como Wikipedia y redes sociales, Israel busca silenciar las voces palestinas, modificando el acceso a información y bloqueando contenidos que documenten crímenes de guerra.

Tolkien en la música progresiva: álbumes y canciones destacadas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde finales de los años 60 y principios de los 70, muchas bandas y artistas de rock progresivo encontraron inspiración en el universo literario de J.R.R. Tolkien. Obras como 'El Señor de los Anillos', 'El Hobbit' y 'El Silmarillion' han influido en la creación de álbumes conceptuales y letras de canciones de grupos como Rush, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Camel, Rick Wakeman y Bo Hansson, entre otros. Canciones como 'The Necromancer' y 'Rivendell' de Rush, 'Nimrodel/The Procession/The White Rider' de Camel o 'Stagnation' de Genesis reflejan referencias directas o alusiones a personajes y lugares de la Tierra Media. Algunos discos, como 'Music Inspired by The Lord of the Rings' de Mostly Autumn o 'Bilbo' de Pär Lindh & Björn Johansson, reinterpretan historias completas de Tolkien mediante música instrumental y composiciones sinfónicas. Destaca también el trabajo de Bo Hansson con su álbum conceptual 'Sagan om Ringen', considerado un referente del rock progresivo inspirado en Tolkien.

España sigue siendo la economía de mayor crecimiento dentro de la zona euro, superando a otras grandes economías como Alemania, Francia e Italia. La demanda interna, impulsada principalmente por el consumo privado y la inversión, será el principal motor de crecimiento entre 2025 y 2027. Además, se espera que el desempleo siga bajando y que la inflación se mantenga controlada.

El rechazo a la nueva Constitución propuesta por Noboa ha sido interpretado como una defensa del legado del correísmo, ya que la actual Carta Magna fue redactada durante el mandato de Rafael Correa.

Desde 2019, Digi ha expandido su cobertura hasta 13 millones de hogares, de los cuales 12 millones (el 93%) pueden recibir velocidades brutas de hasta 10 Gbps gracias a redes XGS-PON. El coste de despliegue medio por vivienda, calculado con la cobertura actual, asciende a 48 €, lo que subraya una eficiencia operativa significativa en el modelo de crecimiento de Digi. El ritmo de expansión continúa aumentando: en 2023 se sumaron 2,8 millones de hogares, en 2024 otros 3 millones y en lo que va de este año se han agregado otros 2 millones hasta septiembre. La meta es llegar a 20 millones en los próximos 3 a 4 años. En Andalucía, donde Digi firmó en 2023 un despliegue conjunto con el fondo Abrdn, ya se han conectados 2,5 millones de hogares.

González subrayó que la victoria del «No» en la consulta popular representa una firme oposición a la injerencia extranjera y a la millonaria campaña mediática orquestada por el Gobierno, que gastó más de siete millones de dólares en publicidad para promover su agenda. La dirigente política también destacó que, a pesar de la influencia de los medios hegemónicos, el pueblo ecuatoriano ha sabido resistir las manipulaciones y ha mostrado su rechazo a la corrupción y el abuso de poder. González señaló que la amenaza de introducir a Ecuador en un conflicto bélico internacional, alineándose con los intereses de EE.UU., fue otro de los puntos clave de la campaña. Además, recordó la experiencia de la base de Manta y cómo la salida de esta base mejoró la seguridad en el país.

Esta herramienta, obligatoria desde 2026, busca mejorar la seguridad vial notificando averías o accidentes mediante una señal digital y luminosa que alerta a la red de la DGT 3.0 y a navegadores GPS. La infografía pretendía explicar su funcionamiento de forma sencilla, pero contenía errores tipográficos, palabras sin sentido y frases incoherentes, lo que reveló una falta total de revisión humana. Entre los fallos más llamativos aparecían palabras como 'avis6ar ar raeto', 'vehícula' o 'piatatorma'.

A diferencia de las sanciones de empleo y sueldo, una amonestación por escrito no implica dejar de trabajar ni deja rastro inmediato de castigo económico, pero sí se considera una sanción formal según el Estatuto de los Trabajadores. El autor advierte de que, aunque las empresas utilicen términos como 'advertencia' o 'conducta inapropiada' en lugar de 'falta' o 'sanción', el efecto legal sigue siendo el mismo: la empresa atribuye al trabajador una falta laboral. El riesgo de no impugnar estas amonestaciones es alto, ya que pueden acumularse y servir posteriormente como justificación para un despido disciplinario sin indemnización.

Se señala que, si se aprueba tal juramento, podría excluir a ateos, personas que prefieren afirmar en vez de jurar, o a comunidades como los cuáqueros, contraviniendo principios constitucionales que protegen la libertad religiosa y prohíben pruebas religiosas para ocupar cargos públicos.

El coche circuló varios kilómetros hasta llegar a la confluencia entre la avenida San Francisco Javier y la avenida Ramón y Cajal, donde una persona advirtió a la conductora que algo se desprendía del coche. Tras el incidente, se desplegó un amplio dispositivo de emergencia compuesto por Bomberos, Policía Local y Nacional, así como el servicio sanitario 061.

El texto también revela diferencias sustanciales entre hospitales, destacando que centros gestionados por concesionarias privadas como Quirón Salud muestran tiempos de espera mucho mayores que los hospitales públicos. Además, se describen mecanismos de derivación de pruebas diagnósticas a centros privados y la presión ejercida sobre el presupuesto público sanitario mediante contratos con empresas privadas.

El fallo también otorga al padre el uso de la vivienda familiar, a pesar de que la madre y la hija todavía la ocupan. El caso se deriva de una revisión de la sentencia del divorcio dictada en 2024, donde se habían establecido medidas relacionadas con el uso de la vivienda y las pensiones alimenticias. En cuanto a la manutención, la decisión judicial concluye que la falta de relación con el padre no justifica la continuidad del pago, ya que no se ha demostrado un perjuicio físico o psíquico hacia el progenitor. Además, se desestimó la solicitud de la madre de incrementar la pensión alimenticia en 200 euros mensuales.

Kelley fue el encargado de evaluar la salud mental de 24 altos mandos nazis antes de los juicios de Núremberg, celebrados tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Su tarea era determinar si estaban mentalmente capacitados para asumir la responsabilidad de sus crímenes. Kelley, formado en la Universidad de California y veterano del ejército norteamericano, convivió durante meses con figuras como Hermann Goering, jefe de la Luftwaffe y principal acusado.

Según el comunicado oficial, estas personas formaban parte de una organización criminal que facilitaba la regularización de extranjeros mediante empadronamientos falsos y parejas de hecho ficticias, con tarifas que podían alcanzar los 15.000 euros por expediente tramitado. Los detenidos y otras diez personas investigadas están acusados de pertenencia a organización criminal, favorecimiento de la inmigración irregular, falsedad documental, usurpación de estado civil y blanqueo de capitales. La investigación se inició tras detectar, a finales del año anterior, un incremento significativo de parejas de hecho con indicios de irregularidad en la provincia de Barcelona.

El reportaje sitúa a Desokupa como un núcleo de red que agrupa a empresas de seguridad y personas con historial en grupos de extrema derecha, señalando prácticas como la hibridación de funciones entre seguridad privada y desalojos, así como el uso de plataformas mediáticas para reforzar reputaciones mutuas.

Así, firmas como OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Microsoft y Anthropic destacan la capacidad de la IA para asumir funciones que antes realizaban personas, afirmando que ciertos roles podrían dejar de necesitar intervención humana; sin embargo, internamente muchas de estas compañías empujan hacia ritmos de trabajo intensos, con presencialidad obligatoria y, en algunos casos, modelos laborales como 996 (de 9 de la mañana a 9 de la noche, seis días a la semana).

Se sospecha que la obra fue exportada de manera irregular. El retrato, de gran valor artístico, había estado en posesión de coleccionistas vieneses y se había presentado en la feria de arte Tefaf en Maastricht con un precio de 15 millones de euros. La pintura, que había estado en Hungría desde 1938, era parte de una colección que había pertenecido a una familia judía que huyó del nazismo. Las autoridades húngaras cuestionan la legalidad de su exportación, ya que el retrato debería haber sido revisado por una licencia de exportación antes de su salida del país. La situación se complica debido a la presencia de un sello de Klimt en la obra, que no fue detectado en el proceso. Ahora, las autoridades deben demostrar si el cuadro fue exportado de forma ilícita. Si se confirma, la pintura debe ser devuelta a Hungría.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-de-viena-incauta-un-retrato-de-gustav-klimt-debido-a-irregularidades-en-su-exportacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fiscalia-de-viena-incauta-un-retrato-de-gustav-klimt-debido-a-irregularidades-en-su-exportacion</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 07:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cierre definitivo de la histórica fábrica de galletas LU tras 94 años de producción en Château-Thierry]]></title><description><![CDATA[La fábrica de galletas LU en Château-Thierry, Francia, ha cerrado sus puertas para siempre tras más de noventa años de actividad. El viernes 14 de noviembre de 2025 fue el último día operativo, cuando los 36 empleados que quedaban participaron en el empaquetado de las últimas galletas. El cierre supone el fin de una era que comenzó en 1931, marcado por historias, el aroma a galletas en la localidad y la presencia constante de la planta en la vida social y económica de la región. El alcalde de Château-Thierry lamentó profundamente esta decisión y subrayó el papel crucial que jugaba la fábrica en la identidad local. El cierre es consecuencia de procesos de reestructuración y de la decisión de Mondelēz, la propietaria actual, de trasladar parte de la producción a la República Checa por razones financieras, lo que llevó a despidos previos y, finalmente, a la clausura total. Seis empleados permanecerán hasta mayo de 2026 para supervisar el desmantelamiento.

A partir de un objeto sencillo, Lam desarrolló un imperio que convirtió la etiqueta “made in Hong Kong” en sinónimo de innovación y exportación a gran escala. Su modelo de producción en serie fue una de las bases que inspiró el crecimiento industrial de la región, sirviendo de ejemplo a numerosas fábricas que comenzaron a establecerse en la China continental durante la segunda mitad del siglo XX.

Se destacan casos en los que víctimas de accidentes no recibieron indemnización por parte de aseguradoras como Reale Seguros, a pesar de un parte amistoso que reconocía la culpa del conductor. Se señala una posible desprotección de los pasajeros y víctimas al considerar a los VTC como alquileres sin conductor, lo que complica la reclamación de indemnizaciones. Además, se denuncian maniobras para eludir controles de ITV mediante cambios temporales de matrícula y se exponen condiciones laborales extremas: jornadas nocturnas de hasta 12 horas con solo un día libre a la semana, sueldos apenas por encima de umbrales mínimos y despidos improcedentes tras ERTE.

La investigación reúne al menos 34 víctimas y 13 personas investigadas, entre ellos varios empresarios, en el marco de la Operación Íncubo y el caso 18 Lovas. Las menores eran captadas a través de redes sociales y engañadas con falsas ofertas de empleo, siendo posteriormente sometidas a prostitución, drogas, abusos y situaciones extremadamente violentas. Una parte de las víctimas procedía de hogares tutelados por el Gobierno de Canarias, lo que agrava la vulnerabilidad de las afectadas. El sumario judicial recoge pruebas de encubrimiento, chantaje, sodomía, coacciones y episodios de zoofilia. La presunta trama operaba mediante alias para proteger la identidad de los clientes y utilizaba vehículos y locales para sus actividades ilícitas.

El cierre del Gobierno federal, que ha paralizado diversas agencias, ha retrasado la difusión de estos indicadores clave para entender la evolución de la economía estadounidense. Karoline Leavitt, portavoz del Ejecutivo, afirmó que existe la posibilidad de que los datos del IPC y del empleo de octubre no se publiquen, lo que dejaría a la Reserva Federal sin información crítica para calibrar su política monetaria en un momento en que el comité de mercados podría reunirse para decidir sobre tipos de interés. La paralización, que ya suma más de 40 días, ha afectado a agencias como el Buró de Estadísticas Laborales y el BEA, limitando la disponibilidad de datos sobre inflación, empleo y balanza comercial.

Al salir del edificio tras participar en un acto sobre la Expo de Osaka, Cani perdió el equilibrio al bajar las escaleras principales y cayó contra una de las históricas vidrieras del artista Mario Sironi, considerada una obra maestra del arte italiano del siglo XX. El impacto rompió la parte derecha de 'La Carta del Lavoro', una vidriera de unos 75 metros cuadrados creada en 1932 por encargo del ministro Giuseppe Bottai. Cani sufrió heridas leves y fue atendido en el lugar, mientras que los carabinieri levantaron acta del incidente.

El 94% de las víctimas no tenían antecedentes penales ni vínculos con estructuras criminales, sino que fueron detenidas en comunidades estigmatizadas bajo cuotas de arresto. Se denuncian torturas, desapariciones forzadas y malos tratos dentro de los centros penitenciarios. Además, hay una creciente represión contra defensores de derechos humanos con detenciones arbitrarias.

Más tarde la recolocaron cerca de un conocido restaurante de la ciudad, coincidiendo con la publicación de decenas de miles de mensajes correos relacionados con Epstein, donde se menciona a Trump repetidas veces, aunque no como remitente ni destinatario. Entre las revelaciones, Epstein sostiene que Trump pasó horas en su casa con una de las víctimas, y que 'sabía sobre las chicas', lo que arroja más sombra sobre el carácter de su relación, en un momento de fuerte presión ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vuelve-la-polemica-estatua-que-representa-la-relacion-entre-trump-y-epstein-en-washington</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vuelve-la-polemica-estatua-que-representa-la-relacion-entre-trump-y-epstein-en-washington</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 20:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Milei elogia a Netanyahu y genera rechazo por sus declaraciones sobre Gaza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente argentino, Javier Milei, ha causado controversia al afirmar que la humanidad debería estar agradecida con el primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, y su gobierno, describiéndolo como el bastión de Occidente.

Las quejas de un vecino denunciaron que el felino dejó huellas en pavimento fresco, orinó en un edredón y orinificó en jardines, provocando molestias y costos legales. La juez impuso una sanción inicial a la dueña, que asciende a 1.250 euros por daños y costos legales, con una multa adicional de 30 euros por cada nueva infracción si el gato intenta cruzar la cerca vecinal. Dada la situación repetida, se emitió una nueva orden que prohíbe sacar al animal de la casa. Este caso, que ha generado atención mediática, subraya los límites entre la convivencia vecinal, el bienestar animal y la responsabilidad de los dueños ante comportamientos problemáticos de sus mascotas.

El historiador explica que la memoria histórica está dividida, ya que durante la dictadura franquista la narrativa oficial excluyó a las voces de los vencidos, lo que dificulta un relato común. También destaca cómo la derecha y algunos sectores de la sociedad española continúan defendiendo aspectos de la dictadura y presentan una versión sesgada de los hechos.

Nutropy emplea fermentación de precisión para generar caseína en micelas a partir de microorganismos cultivados en biorreactores, alimentados con azúcares y nutrientes. Aunque no se ha revelado la cepa exacta, el enfoque busca obtener una proteína funcional capaz de fundirse y cuajar similar a la de la leche de vaca, sin recurrir a la ganadería tradicional ni a los subproductos como el suero. El proyecto apunta a un producto en polvo llamado «queseble», diseñado como ingrediente B2B para que fabricantes alimentarios integren la tecnología sin adaptar radicalmente sus líneas de producción.

El análisis multidisciplinar publicado en la revista Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences revela que la tinta es una mezcla compleja de carbón amorfo, negro de hueso, compuestos ferrogálicos, cera de abejas y derivados de grasas animales.

La historia sigue a Zac Hobson, un científico que, al despertar una mañana, descubre que la ciudad está desierta y que parece ser la única persona sobreviviente. A través de su experiencia, la película explora themes como la soledad, la culpa y la posibilidad de un mundo postapocalíptico donde lo físico y lo metafísico se entrelazan. Se compara con obras clásicas como The Purple Cloud y The World, the Flesh and the Devil, destacando la forma en que la película maneja la desaparición de la humanidad y la pregunta sobre qué significa estar vivo. El filme, de bajo presupuesto (aprox. 1 millón de dólares) se centra en las relaciones entre los pocos personajes y su evolución emocional, con un final que invita a reflexionar sobre la vida, la muerte y la posibilidad de un más allá.

Además, Ben-Gvir rechazó las críticas y declaraciones de líderes mundiales que apoyan una solución de dos estados, y mostró su compromiso de desmilitarizar Gaza y eliminar a Hamas, ya sea por medios diplomáticos o militares. En medio de la creciente violencia en la región, especialmente en Cisjordania, el gobierno israelí ha prometido abordar con dureza los ataques de los colonos contra palestinos y soldados del ejército israelí. Esta postura se da en el contexto de tensiones tanto internas, dentro de Israel, como externas, con los esfuerzos internacionales por encontrar una solución duradera para el conflicto.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ben-gvir-rechaza-la-existencia-de-un-pueblo-palestino-y-su-reconocimiento-como-estado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ben-gvir-rechaza-la-existencia-de-un-pueblo-palestino-y-su-reconocimiento-como-estado</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis crítico del juicio al fiscal general y las estrategias del Supremo en el caso García Ortiz]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este artículo de opinión, escrito por Manuel Rico y publicado por Público, analiza de forma polémica el juicio al fiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz, destacando que, pese a la ausencia de pruebas concluyentes, el proceso ha servido como espectáculo político que expone a diversas figuras institucionales. El autor critica la censura de la retransmisión del juicio por parte del tribunal, y describe a distintos actores —incluida Almudena Lastra, la fiscal superior de la Comunidad de Madrid— en términos de duda y contraposición. Se recogen además argumentos sobre la posible relación entre filtraciones y notas informativas, y se cuestiona la autoría de la filtración del correo electrónico que supuestamente contiene la confesión del ciudadano particular.

Según los testimonios recogidos, los detenidos recibieron palizas casi a diario a su llegada, fueron privados de comida, agua y atención médica, y estuvieron sujetos a un régimen de vigilancia y humillación que incluyó celdas de castigo, aislamiento y, en algunos casos, abuso sexual. Los guardias usaban capuchas y se protegían con identidades falsas, lo que subraya la falta de transparencia y el uso de prácticas clandestinas en un sistema penitenciario que opera fuera del marco legal. Además, las familias de los venezolanos encontraron obstáculos para acceder a información sobre su paradero y estatus, incluyendo respuestas negadas a habeas corpus y peticiones de información.

A través de los propios datos proporcionados por la dictadura, se pueden observar las políticas habitacionales que se implementaron en ese período, así como las dificultades a las que se enfrentaron muchos españoles para acceder a una vivienda digna. A pesar de las cifras oficiales que intentaban mostrar un crecimiento en el sector, las realidades de las clases trabajadoras y las tensiones sociales no se reflejaron adecuadamente en estos informes. Los datos muestran una clara disparidad entre las zonas urbanas y rurales, con la vivienda en las grandes ciudades siendo más accesible en comparación con las zonas rurales. Sin embargo, la especulación inmobiliaria y la falta de políticas inclusivas dificultaron el acceso a la vivienda para una gran parte de la población, especialmente para los sectores más desfavorecidos.

El desarrollo del partido terminó con una victoria de la selección vasca por 3-0, gracias a goles de Unai Elgezabal, Gorka Guruzeta e Urko Iruretagoiena. Más allá del resultado, el momento cumbre fue la exhibición de apoyo y fraternidad entre ambas aficiones, reflejada en cánticos, ovaciones y una pancarta de los jugadores palestinos que decía “Thank you Basque Country”. Durante el encuentro, se registraron interrupciones menores por bengalas y objetos lanzados al campo, y hubo homenajes a jugadores de pelota vinculados a la Euskal Selekzioa.

La organización argumenta que su labor es esencial porque, además de atender necesidades básicas como la alimentación, contribuyen a crear vínculos y ofrecer compañía. Destacan, además, que el derecho a la alimentación está amparado por la Declaración Universal de los Derechos Humanos y diversas directrices de Naciones Unidas, por lo que impedir el acceso a comida vulnera los derechos de los colectivos más débiles.

A partir del 30 de noviembre, si no aceptan una subida de hasta un 70% en el alquiler, deberán abandonar sus hogares. La subida afectaría a inquilinos que llevan más de una década en las viviendas, sin ninguna negociación previa.

La situación ha sido llevada al pleno de las Cortes de Aragón, donde se ha solicitado una revisión de la política a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vecinos-de-un-bloque-de-vpo-en-jaca-enfrentan-un-drastico-aumento-de-alquiler-sin-negociacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/vecinos-de-un-bloque-de-vpo-en-jaca-enfrentan-un-drastico-aumento-de-alquiler-sin-negociacion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Murcia deniega la Ayuda al Alquiler Joven por falta de fondos y abre nueva convocatoria regional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia reporta que la Consejería de Fomento de la Región de Murcia ha denegado la Ayuda al Alquiler Joven, alegando agotamiento del crédito procedente de fondos estatales. Usuarios como Juana y Claudia llevan años esperando una respuesta, con expedientes que permanecen sin resolver desde 2023. La subvención, creada en 2023, cubría hasta el 60% del alquiler con topes de 360 euros mensuales para vivienda y 180 para habitaciones, y quedó suspendida al agotarse el presupuesto, dejando a cientos de solicitantes en una situación precaria. La directora general de Vivienda, María Dolores Gil, indicó que se exploraron opciones para atender todas las solicitudes, incluso solicitando remanentes al Ministerio de Vivienda, pero la respuesta siempre fue negativa. La Consejería anunció una nueva convocatoria dotada con dos millones de euros de fondos regionales para revaluar expedientes no tramitados. El bloqueo y la gestión generaron críticas de sindicatos y fuerzas políticas, señalando que la r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/murcia-deniega-la-ayuda-al-alquiler-joven-por-falta-de-fondos-y-abre-nueva-convocatoria-regional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/murcia-deniega-la-ayuda-al-alquiler-joven-por-falta-de-fondos-y-abre-nueva-convocatoria-regional</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:42:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cueva Cacao en Catamarca: evidencia temprana de poblamiento humano y sus implicaciones para la historia de América]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia relata el hallazgo en la Cueva Cacao, situada a más de 3.500 metros de altitud en la puna catamarqueña, donde científicos argentinos y franceses han encontrado restos y artefactos datados entre 40.000 y 50.000 años de antigüedad. Este descubrimiento pone en cuestión la teoría Clovis sobre la llegada del Homo sapiens a América, proponiendo un poblamiento más temprano y complejo, con posibles ocupaciones milenarias y un registro que incluiría pinturas rupestres y objetos cotidianos. El artículo detalla el descubrimiento inicial en los años 80 y las investigaciones posteriores de la Misión Arqueológica Franco-Argentina (MAFANS), dirigidas por Christophe Lahaye y Carlos Aschero, financiadas por Francia. También se mencionan hallazgos clave como costillas de Scelidotherium, mechones de pelo y artefactos líticos, así como indicios de un uso ritual de la cueva y una cronología no lineal de ocupaciones en el territorio. Se subraya la importancia mundial de estos hallazgos y su poten]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cueva-cacao-en-catamarca-evidencia-temprana-de-poblamiento-humano-y-sus-implicaciones-para-la-historia-de-america</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cueva-cacao-en-catamarca-evidencia-temprana-de-poblamiento-humano-y-sus-implicaciones-para-la-historia-de-america</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orihuela: cinco alcaldes del PP llegan a juicio por casos de corrupción en 30 años]]></title><description><![CDATA[Orihuela, municipio clave en la Comunitat Valenciana, afronta una secuencia histórica de procesos judiciales que involucran a su administración municipal y al Partido Popular. Desde 1986, la ciudad ha sido gobernada mayoritariamente por el PP, con cinco alcaldes que han enfrentado causas judiciales relacionadas con corrupción y estafa. El alcalde en funciones, José Vegara, fue citado para sentarse en el banquillo por presuntos delitos contra la Hacienda y fraude fiscal, relacionados con su etapa como apoderado general y consejero delegado de una ITV. Estas imputaciones se suman a antecedentes de otros exalcaldes del PP en Orihuela: Luis Fernando Cartagena, José Manuel Medina, Mónica Lorente y Emilio Bascuñana, quienes ya han enfrentado o enfrentan juicios y condenas, incluyendo casos como Brugal, relacionado con la gestión de residuos y contratos públicos. El historial judicial subraya una preocupante continuidad en la sucesión de cargos municipales bajo el PP, con condenas previas y m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/orihuela-cinco-alcaldes-del-pp-llegan-a-juicio-por-casos-de-corrupcion-en-30-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/orihuela-cinco-alcaldes-del-pp-llegan-a-juicio-por-casos-de-corrupcion-en-30-anos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Donaciones de órganos tras la eutanasia: un marco de decisión personal y gestión médica]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda el fenómeno creciente de las donaciones de órganos en procesos de final de vida, especialmente en el marco de la eutanasia, en España. Desde el Hospital Gregorio Marañón de Madrid y la Organización Nacional de Trasplantes (ONT) se resalta que, desde 2021, las donaciones realizadas tras la eutanasia han beneficiado a cientos de receptores, y que este enfoque forma parte de la estrategia 2026-2030 para mantener a España como líder mundial en trasplantes. El reportaje contextualiza la experiencia de Ana, una joven con espina bífida que optó por la eutanasia y falleció en 2023; su familia y médicos explican el proceso, desde la valoración clínica hasta la coordinación entre equipos, pruebas para confirmar aptitud de órganos y la necesidad de un entorno cálido y humano para el proceso. Se subraya que la decisión de recibir ayuda para morir no condiciona la donación de órganos, y que la coordinadora de trasplantes enfatiza la importancia de la empatía y la cercanía con paci]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/donaciones-de-organos-tras-la-eutanasia-un-marco-de-decision-personal-y-gestion-medica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/donaciones-de-organos-tras-la-eutanasia-un-marco-de-decision-personal-y-gestion-medica</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Irán denuncia que amenaza de EE.UU. contra Venezuela viola la Carta de la ONU]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia informa sobre las declaraciones del portavoz de la Cancillería iraní, Esmail Baqai, quien advierte sobre las graves repercusiones de un incremento de las actividades militares de Estados Unidos en el Caribe y América Latina. Baqai sostiene que la escalada en la región, justificada por la lucha contra el narcotráfico, podría poner en riesgo la paz y la seguridad internacionales y constituye una violación clara de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas. Además, señala que la amenaza de uso de la fuerza contra Venezuela atenta contra la soberanía y la integridad territorial, y denuncia que Washington busca derrocar al gobierno venezolano para apropiarse de recursos como oro, petróleo y gas. El artículo también recoge el llamamiento a la ONU y al secretario general António Guterres para proteger la paz y evitar el unilateralismo beligerante, así como la respuesta venezolana que garantiza reforzar la defensa de la soberanía ante estas tensiones.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-denuncia-que-amenaza-de-ee-uu-contra-venezuela-viola-la-carta-de-la-onu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-denuncia-que-amenaza-de-ee-uu-contra-venezuela-viola-la-carta-de-la-onu</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
