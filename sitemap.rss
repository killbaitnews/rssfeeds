The materials, captured in 2020, a year after Epstein died in jail, show various areas of the property, including bedrooms, an office or library, a dentist chair room, and a chalkboard with words like 'fin', 'intellectual', 'deception', and 'power'. The release follows ongoing investigations into Epstein's crimes, including a 2022 settlement in which the US Virgin Islands attorney general secured over $100 million from Epstein’s estate after alleging sexual abuse and trafficking at Little St James, one of his two islands. Congressional leaders emphasized that while the images do not reveal new evidence, their release is part of a broader effort to maintain public transparency and pressure on the Justice Department to release additional files by the December 19 deadline.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have joined forces to advance legislation banning members of Congress from trading stocks. Using a discharge petition—a procedural tactic previously employed to release the Jeffrey Epstein files—the coalition seeks to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has limited floor votes on certain issues. Once a discharge petition gains enough signatures and seven legislative days pass, a vote is automatically scheduled. The push reflects growing public concern over lawmakers using insider knowledge for personal financial gain, an issue highlighted during previous administrations but delayed under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) described the coalition as surprising given its ideological diversity. Earlier attempts by Luna to use a discharge petition for proxy voting rights were blocked by Johnson.

The warning comes after a recent EU-US trade agreement indicated mutual recognition of each other's automotive regulations. EU safety standards have been credited with reducing European road deaths by 36% since 2010, while US road deaths rose by 30% in the same period, with significant increases in pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. European regulations mandate life-saving technologies such as pedestrian protection, automated emergency braking, and lane-keeping assistance. Aligning with weaker US standards could undermine decades of progress in road safety and public health. Moreover, the EU is preparing to implement stricter limits on vehicle-related pollution, whereas US rules are being relaxed. Accepting lower standards could increase European exposure to harmful pollutants linked to ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-cities-and-ngos-warn-against-lowering-vehicle-safety-standards-to-us-levels</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-cities-and-ngos-warn-against-lowering-vehicle-safety-standards-to-us-levels</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 08:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Canadian Photographer Captures Rare Toad Mutation with Eyes in Its Mouth]]></title><description><![CDATA[In 1992, Canadian photographer Scott Gardner discovered a toad in Burlington County, Ontario, with an extremely rare genetic mutation: its eyes were located inside its mouth. Gardner photographed the toad and the image was published in The Hamilton Spectator, quickly gaining attention in both Canada and the United States. The toad's unusual appearance baffled scientists, but it has been confirmed as a real phenomenon known as a macromutation. This type of mutation can significantly alter an organism's structure, and in amphibians, it sometimes affects limbs or other body parts. In this case, the mutation caused the toad's eye sockets to be absent, resulting in the eyes growing from its palate. While the exact cause of such mutations remains unclear, scientists suspect a parasitic trematode infection may play a role. Despite its strange appearance, the toad can live a normal life, as its eyes remain functional. Interestingly, even normally developed frogs and toads can retract their eye]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canadian-photographer-captures-rare-toad-mutation-with-eyes-in-its-mouth</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canadian-photographer-captures-rare-toad-mutation-with-eyes-in-its-mouth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Geopolitical Maneuvers and the Uncertain Path to Peace in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article by Rafael Poch de Feliu examines the complex and contradictory dynamics surrounding current peace discussions about the war in Ukraine. It highlights statements by Vladimir Putin asserting that Russia is not seeking war with Europe but is prepared for it if necessary, contrasting this readiness with what he describes as Europe’s 'illusion' of defeating Russia. The piece details NATO’s increasing aggressiveness, citing potential preemptive strikes on Moscow and ongoing maritime drone attacks against Russian cargo ships allegedly orchestrated by British military personnel in Ukraine.

Poch explains that contacts between Putin and U.S. envoys—specifically Donald Trump’s associates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner—reflect internal divisions within the American establishment about how to handle Russia. The article argues that Trump's negotiations with Moscow are pragmatic rather than pacifist, seeking to save resources, shift focus to Asia, and maintain pressure on Russia and Chi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/geopolitical-maneuvers-and-the-uncertain-path-to-peace-in-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/geopolitical-maneuvers-and-the-uncertain-path-to-peace-in-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ukraine Conflict Approaches a Formal End, But Tensions and Hybrid Warfare May Persist]]></title><description><![CDATA[The news article reports that recent Russian advances in Ukraine, including the capture of Pokrovsk and Volchansk, indicate a gradual decline in Ukrainian operational capabilities. Although the territory gained in recent weeks is modest relative to Ukraine’s total size, these advances are more resilient due to the prevalence of drones, which limit rapid tank movements but strengthen occupied positions. Ukrainian commanders have signaled that they may resist political agreements involving territorial withdrawal, but the article notes that actual military defiance is unlikely without central supply interruptions. The author argues that the formal conclusion of the conflict could arrive by spring or summer, yet warns that this will not be a true end. The piece highlights a potential long-term alliance between radicalized Ukrainian forces and European militaristic agendas, which may result in permanent hybrid warfare, including sabotage, cyberattacks, and covert operations.

The testimony alleges a systemic 'kill policy' by the UK Special Forces unit UKSF1 and describes cover-ups by senior commanders and a failure to properly investigate these war crimes. The inquiry revealed incidents where the number of enemy killed far exceeded weapons recovered, casting doubt on official reports. A particularly disturbing case cited was the shooting of two young children and their parents during a nighttime raid in Nimruz province in 2012. The officer described a culture within UKSF1 of casual killings and data manipulation to conceal unlawful acts. This evidence adds to growing allegations of British war crimes in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2013, highlighting the suppression of investigations by military leadership and the Ministry of Defence.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/inquiry-reveals-uk-special-forces-executed-civilians-including-children-in-afghanistan</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/inquiry-reveals-uk-special-forces-executed-civilians-including-children-in-afghanistan</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 05:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Burkina Faso Revives SN-BRAFASO Brewery to Generate Thousands of Jobs]]></title><description><![CDATA[After over 15 years of inactivity, Burkina Faso has revitalized the SN-BRAFASO brewery with a major public investment. The factory, located in Komsilga, was reopened following an overhaul, and is set to produce 600,000 hectoliters annually. The reopening marks a significant step in utilizing local raw materials like maize, sorghum, and rice, essential to the country's agriculture. The rehabilitation, costing over 17 billion CFA francs, also brings new job opportunities, with 300 direct jobs and an expected 20,000 indirect jobs across sectors such as logistics, distribution, and agriculture. President Ibrahim Traoré expressed his pride, calling the reopening a victory against imperialism and a symbol of the resilience of Burkina Faso's people. The factory plans to launch two flagship beverages, BRAF'OR and BRAFASO, and expand to produce soft drinks and mineral water. The move aligns with the government's push for economic autonomy and local industrial growth.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/burkina-faso-revives-sn-brafaso-brewery-to-generate-thousands-of-jobs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/burkina-faso-revives-sn-brafaso-brewery-to-generate-thousands-of-jobs</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 02:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Fabergé Winter Egg Sells for $30.2 Million at Christie’s Auction]]></title><description><![CDATA[The renowned Fabergé Winter Egg, considered one of the most exquisite Imperial Eggs ever created, has resurfaced after being lost for over two decades. Originally purchased in 2002 by a Qatari prince for $9.6 million, it sold at Christie’s London for £22.9 million ($30.2 million), surpassing expectations. Out of the 50 Fabergé Imperial Eggs commissioned for Russian Tsarinas, only 44 survive today, with just six held privately. Designed by Alma Pihl, granddaughter of Fabergé’s workmaster, the Winter Egg is adorned with more than 3,200 rose-cut diamonds and intricately carved rock crystal, platinum, nephrite, and gold details. Its hidden surprise—a platinum and diamond trellis basket containing quartz wood anemones and garnets—is emblematic of Fabergé’s signature craftsmanship. The egg’s design was inspired by the snowflakes seen through Pihl’s workshop window and is part of the Winter Jewels series, initially created for Swedish-Russian tycoon Emanuel Nobel.

The bird, listed as red by the RSPB due to its declining population in the UK, was discovered shivering under a hot tub step on the 16th deck by Charlene Halsey and her daughters. Observing its distress, the family took the bird into their cabin, kept it warm, and cared for it overnight. They named it Aaron Burrd after the musical Hamilton. Once the ship docked, Derek Davey, a specialist in seabird rescue and rehabilitation, took responsibility for the corncrake. He noted that the bird likely boarded the ship while it was in the Mediterranean and highlighted the challenges of providing suitable overwintering conditions before the corncrake can return north to its breeding grounds. Corncrakes are highly secretive birds, primarily living in tall grass, with a distinctive 'crex crex' call. Their population has sharply declined since the 1970s, making the]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rare-corncrake-rescued-on-cruise-ship-by-passengers</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rare-corncrake-rescued-on-cruise-ship-by-passengers</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 23:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical and Mythological Stories Surrounding the Apple]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article explores the fascinating and sometimes dark history of the apple, highlighting its cultural, literary, and mythological significance. It begins by explaining the etymology of the word 'apple,' tracing it back to the Latin term 'malum' and the Roman botanist Gaius Matius, whose cultivated variety influenced the modern Spanish term. The article then discusses the apple in the context of the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden, noting that the original text never specifies the fruit and that the Latin translation by Saint Jerome created the association by using the word 'malum,' which also means 'evil.' Next, the apple's role in Greek mythology is recounted, focusing on the golden apple of discord that sparked the Trojan War. Finally, the story of Snow White is examined, contrasting the Grimm brothers' original dark tale with the more familiar modern version. The piece emphasizes the apple's recurring presence in human storytelling as both a symbol of temptation and a cataly]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/historical-and-mythological-stories-surrounding-the-apple</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/historical-and-mythological-stories-surrounding-the-apple</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 23:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dramatic Decline in Child Mortality Over Human History]]></title><description><![CDATA[For most of human history, around half of all children died before reaching puberty. In contrast, by 2020, global child mortality had dropped to just 4.3%, with countries like Japan and Norway achieving rates as low as 0.3%. This extraordinary reduction is attributed to advancements in nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and significant decreases in poverty, conflicts, and famine. Personal anecdotes shared by readers illustrate how infant and child mortality was a common experience only a century ago, with multiple generations experiencing the loss of siblings or children. Modern medicine and public health improvements have fundamentally transformed human lifespan, largely by preventing early deaths rather than prolonging life at older ages. Experts argue that investing in public health measures could further enhance global health outcomes.

Unlike previous images that exaggerated reds and browns, this mosaic presents Mars as it might appear to the human eye, showcasing muted grays, yellows, oranges, and pale blues that highlight the planet's mineral diversity. The map, with a resolution of approximately 2 kilometers per pixel, was created from tens of thousands of observations collected between 2004 and 2022. The HRSC's unique multispectral and stereo imaging capabilities allowed scientists to correct for dust levels, variable sunlight, and atmospheric haze to produce a seamless global map.

It explains that the islands’ geographic position between Africa and Europe makes them a key transit point for migrants, including unaccompanied minors. Criminal organizations are exploiting these vulnerable children, often arriving from West African countries, for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Systemic failures in asylum procedures and overcrowded child protection centers have created conditions in which traffickers can operate easily. The piece highlights recent investigations by Spanish and European authorities, which uncovered several networks linked to both local and international crime groups. Many victims are reported to have disappeared from government shelters or informal housing, indicating major gaps in monitoring and support.

Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach announced six charges against Ceballos — three for voting without being qualified and three for election perjury — following his reelection in November. The charges stem from Ceballos’s history of voting in U.S. elections since 1991, despite not being a U.S. citizen. According to state prosecutors, these offenses could lead to over five years of imprisonment and fines exceeding $200,000. In addition to the criminal case, the Department of Homeland Security has warned it may initiate deportation proceedings that could send Ceballos back to Mexico, where he has not lived since early childhood. Now 54, Ceballos claimed he never realized that his immigration status made him ineligible to vote.

Romanian customs agents detained the truck, discovering military equipment including 18 portable anti-tank rocket launchers, 8 additional launchers, a portable air-defense system, and parts of a Geran-2 drone downed in Ukraine. The truck had already passed Moldovan inspections without issue. The Moldovan parliament held a closed session to discuss the incident, while opposition politicians demanded the dismissal of customs and border officials. The government remained silent, claiming inadequate detection equipment was to blame. Further investigation led to several arrests, including the driver, a transportation company director, a client, a customs agent, and later, the alleged organizer.

These files include candid photos and reports monitoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates during key moments in the 1960s, including his visit to New York City shortly after winning the Nobel Peace Prize. Despite public praise from city officials, the files show a deep police distrust and covert surveillance driven by alignment with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover’s hostile views of King as a communist and liar. The New York police engaged in extensive spying, disruption, and sabotage efforts against civil rights activists long before the FBI's infamous COINTELPRO program.

Ford was the first African American to appear on a national ticket, highlighting the Communist Party's efforts to position itself as a home for Black voters during a period of widespread segregation. The poster also featured a map of the 'Black Belt,' areas in the Deep South with large African American populations, advocating their right to self-governance, a radical stance compared to mainstream U.S. politics at the time. Foster, a prominent labor organizer and three-time presidential candidate, suffered a heart attack mid-campaign, leaving Ford to handle most public campaigning.

Despite the truce, Israeli attacks have continued in several areas of the Gaza Strip. In the last 24 hours alone, three additional Palestinians were reported dead. Authorities have also retrieved 607 bodies from earlier bombardments and warned that more victims remain trapped under rubble and inaccessible roads due to security risks and lack of rescue capacity.

According to the ministry, these new figures bring the total death toll in Gaza since the start of the Israeli offensive in October 2023 to at least 70,103, with more than 170,985 wounded. The report also cites a recent study from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, which provides a grim reassessment of the human cost of the Gaza war.

Gilbert, best known for creating *Maniac Mansion*, *Monkey Island*, and *Thimbleweed Park*, explains that the pivot was not as abrupt as it seemed. Although he is most closely associated with narrative-driven adventures, he has also worked on reflex-based titles such as the *Backyard Sports* series and *DeathSpank*. His inspiration for the new project stemmed from his appreciation for modern action roguelites like *Binding of Isaac* and *Dead Cells*. 

Originally, Gilbert attempted to develop a large open-world action RPG inspired by *The Legend of Zelda*, but the ambition proved unrealistic for a small three-person team.

This shift is mainly due to deforestation in the Congo rainforest, the second-largest in the world, which has been severely affected by logging and mining activities. From 2011 to 2017, African forests lost 106 million tonnes of biomass per year, contributing approximately 200 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. The Congo rainforest alone was responsible for a significant portion of this loss. These changes complicate global efforts to reduce emissions and combat climate change. While satellite data has been used to measure this biomass loss, some experts caution that these measurements may not accurately capture the full extent of the impact, particularly when it comes to forests with different types of trees.

In a recent post, Krugman argued that the Trump administration's associates and financial supporters are actively dismantling the safeguards put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. He warned that this could lead to a collapse similar to the one witnessed in 2008. Key policies that are of concern to Krugman include weakened bank regulations and support for the unregulated crypto industry, particularly the GENIUS Act, which promotes stablecoins as a form of banking. According to Krugman, while Trump himself may not fully grasp the severity of the situation, his administration’s actions are placing the financial system at significant risk. Krugman urged the Democratic Party to be cautious, as the ongoing tariff policies and the growing influence of crypto could make another financial meltdown more likely.

It traces a history where elite groups, such as slaveholders and industrialists, have consistently sought to undermine the government's ability to raise revenue. This has been done through manipulating tax systems, limiting tax enforcement, and employing strategies to weaken democratic governance. The piece connects historical moments, such as the influence of slaveowners in the formation of the U.S. Constitution and the subsequent attempts to limit the federal government's power to impose taxes, with contemporary policies under the Trump administration. The focus is on how a weakened tax system allows elites to retain disproportionate political and economic power. The author argues that without a fair and effective tax system, democracy cannot thrive, and the people's ability to hold government accountable is undermined. The piece highlights the long-standing]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-roots-of-anti-tax-movements-among-america-s-elite</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-roots-of-anti-tax-movements-among-america-s-elite</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 14:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Germany Faces Economic Stagnation and Growing Discontent Amid Merz’s Austerity Policies]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes the deepening economic and political crisis in Germany under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose austerity measures have sparked widespread frustration across all social sectors, including business leaders. Germany’s economic model, heavily reliant on exports, is faltering as imports from China surpass German machinery exports for the first time. Industrial production continues to fall sharply: machine tool manufacturing has lost 20,000 jobs in six months, the automotive industry 50,000 in a year, and chemical production has hit a 30-year low. Only the military sector shows growth, but its revenues remain minor compared to giants like Volkswagen.

Peter Leibinger, president of the Federation of German Industries, warned publicly that the economic model is collapsing. Government forecasts predict weak growth — about 1.3% for 2026 — driven largely by a 500-billion-euro stimulus fund aimed at infrastructure modernization and corporate investment incentives. However, priv]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-faces-economic-stagnation-and-growing-discontent-amid-merz-s-austerity-policies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/germany-faces-economic-stagnation-and-growing-discontent-amid-merz-s-austerity-policies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 14:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cyberattacks Against Israeli Space Sector During Gaza Conflict Linked to Palestinian Supporters]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent report reveals that the Israeli space sector has been targeted by numerous cyberattacks between January 2023 and July 2025, with a significant uptick in activity during the Gaza conflict. The analysis, published by the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zurich, documents 237 cyber incidents against Israel's space-related organizations, including the Israel Space Agency (ISA) and military contractors like Rafael. These cyberattacks, largely attributed to pro-Palestinian groups, intensified during the June conflict between Israel and Iran, peaking with 72 attacks in one month. The attacks were mainly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults, which flood websites with traffic, rendering them inoperable. Other attacks involved data breaches and leaks, some of which coincided with major military events in the conflict. The report suggests that the true scale of these cyberattacks is likely much larger than what is publicly documented.

While much focus has been placed on the fentanyl crisis, the U.S. is equally dependent on China for a wide range of synthetic substances, including medicinal components. The growth of China's pharmaceutical industry began in the 1950s, and it now plays a dominant role in the global market, especially in key raw materials (KSMs) necessary for the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Approximately half of the drugs used in the U.S. come from China, which supplies at least one essential chemical for over 700 critical medications, such as amoxicillin. While amoxicillin seems to be imported from various countries, its four key chemical components are entirely produced in China.

Among the most targeted is Home Depot, which has become notorious for allowing ICE agents to use its parking lots for raids on day laborers. In response, protests and calls for boycotts have intensified. In one highly publicized protest, activists staged a disruptive demonstration at a Home Depot in Monrovia, California, following the tragic death of a Guatemalan man who was fleeing an ICE raid. Protests like these, organized by groups such as the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON), are designed to hurt the companies' bottom lines and influence their business decisions by drawing attention to their ties with ICE.

The Australian humpback dolphin, also known as Sousa sahulensis, displays remarkable cultural intelligence by finding and balancing sea sponges on their heads, a behavior that seems to be a form of sexual display. This ritual, which has been studied by experts at the University of Western Australia, demonstrates the dolphins' strength and coordination as they detach the sponges from the ocean floor and perform an elaborate juggling display. The use of the sponge, which requires significant physical skill, signals to the female dolphin that the male is capable and strong, making him a desirable mate. This behavior is part of a broader trend in animal mating rituals, where unusual objects or actions are used to attract potential partners.

These accounts describe acts such as targeting unarmed civilians, large-scale demolitions, and explicit orders to disregard international law. One of the central allegations concerns the so-called 'Mosquito Protocol,' in which Palestinian civilians, including minors, were reportedly forced to enter potentially booby-trapped zones, such as tunnels, in direct violation of international humanitarian law. The documentary’s interviews reveal that this practice became common among several Israeli units. Soldiers recounted how civilians were used to scout dangerous areas before the troops advanced, describing this as a normalized tactic within the army.

The study analyzed workforce data from 2.4 million employees across 142 companies and found that about 5.3% of laid-off workers have returned, signaling an increase in the 'layoff boomerang' trend. This rehiring surge highlights the current limitations of AI technologies, which often automate only parts of tasks rather than fully replacing human roles. Implementation of AI also involves significant infrastructure, security, and data costs, requiring human specialists to manage and correct automated outputs. Supporting this, research from MIT shows that 95% of companies have not realized meaningful financial benefits from AI investments. Additionally, data indicates that layoffs intended to save costs may be financially counterproductive once severance and other expenses are included.

The restrictions, which create a no-fly zone above Mar-a-Lago, have redirected airplane traffic over nearby homes that were previously unaffected by aircraft noise or emissions. According to The Washington Post, the new routes cause aircraft to roar above residential areas from early in the morning until late at night, disturbing residents’ sleep and lowering property values by as much as 20 percent. 

The Secret Service justified the measure as necessary to ensure the security of the former president, stating that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was asked to institute temporary flight restrictions that will remain until at least October of next year.

The idea of a Prime Meridian, or zero longitude, is centuries old and was once based on celestial navigation, specifically the alignment with stars and time measurement. For many years, the Greenwich Meridian served as the world's zero point, but modern GPS technology has led to a more precise system. This shift began during the Space Race in the 1950s when the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite sparked scientific advancements. By using satellites, more accurate measurements could be made, taking into account Earth's irregular shape and gravitational variations.

More than 260 people died in the explosion, most of whom were Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The British had converted the ship into a prison, intending to deport nearly 1,900 refugees to colonies such as Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago. The conditions on board were deplorable. The Haganah opposed the disembarkation of the refugees as they did not meet the desired demographic profile of young, military-fit settlers. To prevent their landing, the Zionist group planted a bomb on the ship, causing it to sink in just 16 minutes, taking hundreds of lives before rescuers could reach them.

The controversy began when right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich urged her to remain in office, prompting Greene to respond with a strongly worded rebuttal. She argued that critics underestimate the personal danger and hostility she faces as a high-profile political figure, referencing the recent assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk as an example of the risks confronting outspoken public figures in 2025. 

Greene further expanded her criticism to include what she described as a pattern of Republican men dismissing or belittling her, invoking sexist stereotypes to describe how she feels she is treated by some members of her own party.

Interestingly, its origin is entirely different from its modern meaning. The term 'huevos' in this expression was originally spelled 'uebos', an archaic word derived from the Latin 'opus', meaning 'necessity' or 'something required'. Historically, 'Manda uebos' was the Romance adaptation of the legal phrase 'Mandat opus!', which conveyed the idea that necessity compels action. Over time, the Latin 'opus' evolved into 'uebos' during the Middle Ages. The modern spelling 'huevos' coincidentally aligns with the word for 'eggs', which has led to humorous reinterpretations related to male anatomy. Contemporary variants include expressions like 'manda cojones', 'tiene huevos', and 'estar hasta los huevos', all of which interchangeably use 'cojones' to convey similar meanings. This evolution illustrates how language changes over centuries, with phoneti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-origins-and-evolution-of-the-expression-manda-huevos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-origins-and-evolution-of-the-expression-manda-huevos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 15:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Military Junta Seizes Power in Guinea-Bissau Amid Political Tensions]]></title><description><![CDATA[On November 28, 2025, a military junta seized power in Guinea-Bissau, creating uncertainty about the country's political future. The ousted President, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, a former brigadier general who came to power in 2020, had been ruling by decree since dissolving the parliament in December 2023 following an alleged coup attempt. Embaló faced criticism for consolidating power and potentially staging a self-coup to secure his position amid contested election dates in 2024. Prior to the takeover, he had strengthened ties with Russia and distanced Guinea-Bissau from Portugal, including expelling Portuguese media outlets for alleged election interference. The military, led by Brigadier General Dinis Incanha, justified the coup as a response to plans by political actors and criminal networks to manipulate elections and destabilize the country. The junta has established a temporary high command to restore security and public order.

Esta modificación, que se encuentra en fase de consulta pública, también invalidará cualquier tipo de represalia contra estos trabajadores, incluyendo despidos durante el periodo de prueba o decisiones empresariales discriminatorias. El objetivo es ofrecer mayor protección a los empleados que informen sobre infracciones normativas, en línea con la directiva europea contra la corrupción de 2023. Además, todas las empresas con más de 50 empleados deberán establecer canales internos de denuncia. Esta normativa tiene como fin garantizar que los empleados no sufran represalias por ejercer su derecho a la denuncia, un tema que, según Yolanda Díaz, la ministra de Trabajo, es crucial para fortalecer la lucha contra la corrupción tanto en el sector público como privado.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trabajo-protegera-a-los-empleados-que-denuncien-corrupcion-prohibiendo-despidos-como-represalia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trabajo-protegera-a-los-empleados-que-denuncien-corrupcion-prohibiendo-despidos-como-represalia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Suiza debate la obligatoriedad del servicio militar para mujeres tras el rechazo a la propuesta]]></title><description><![CDATA[En Suiza, el debate sobre la inclusión de las mujeres en el servicio militar obligatorio ha cobrado fuerza recientemente. Hasta ahora, los hombres son los únicos obligados a realizar el servicio, mientras que las mujeres podían participar de forma voluntaria. Sin embargo, una iniciativa propuesta buscaba cambiar esta normativa, sugiriendo que todas las personas, independientemente de su género, deberían cumplir con un servicio nacional, ya sea militar o en tareas de protección civil, medioambientales o sociales. La propuesta fue rechazada rotundamente en un referéndum celebrado el 30 de noviembre de 2025, con más del 84 % de los votantes en contra. Muchos argumentaron que el ejército y los servicios de protección civil ya cuentan con suficientes efectivos, y que imponer nuevas obligaciones sería costoso para el Estado. Además, se consideró que exigir a las mujeres una carga adicional, dada su ya desproporcionada responsabilidad en los cuidados y tareas domésticas, sería injusto.

Aunque la medida parecía efectiva al principio, pronto se demostró que su diseño era un desastre. Los cazadores, en lugar de matar a las ratas, simplemente les cortaban las colas y las liberaban, lo que llevó a un aumento en la población de roedores. Esta práctica fomentó la cría y el tráfico de ratas y colas, exacerbando el problema de salud en lugar de solucionarlo. La caza de ratas se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo las políticas mal diseñadas pueden tener consecuencias imprevistas, al no comprender la complejidad de los comportamientos humanos y los ecosistemas urbanos. A pesar del fracaso de la caza, la peste continuó afectando a Hanoi, mostrando que las intervenciones mal enfocadas pueden empeorar la situación.

Redondo calificó la medida de 'devastadora', señalando que envía un mensaje negativo a los operadores de justicia y socava la lucha contra el narcotráfico. Según Redondo, la decisión es contradictoria, ya que mientras EE.UU. implementa políticas para combatir las drogas y el crimen organizado, al mismo tiempo se perdona a alguien que utilizó su poder para proteger el narcotráfico. Hernández, extraditado durante el mandato de la actual presidenta Xiomara Castro, fue liberado después de recibir el perdón de Trump, quien alegó que el gobierno de Joe Biden había tendido una trampa al exmandatario.

En contraste, Malta ha adoptado un marco más flexible y competitivo, atrayendo a operadores internacionales por la claridad y adaptabilidad de sus normas.

El glaciar del Aneto ha sufrido una fractura bajo el Pico del Medio, perdiendo 3,6 hectáreas y reduciendo su superficie activa a 30 hectáreas, consolidando su tendencia descendente. Además, se registraron descensos puntuales de hasta cuatro metros en varias zonas, mientras que pequeñas áreas con nieve residual mostraron ganancias puntuales de hasta 1,6 metros, insuficientes para revertir la pérdida neta.

La iniciativa fue presentada por la representante Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) y cuenta con el apoyo de figuras tan diversas como Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) y Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.). Este mecanismo permite saltarse la oposición del presidente de la Cámara, Mike Johnson, y asegurar que la legislación llegue al pleno una vez que se alcanzan suficientes firmas y se cumplan los plazos legislativos establecidos. La medida responde a crecientes preocupaciones sobre posibles conflictos de interés y el uso de información privilegiada por parte de los congresistas, un tema que ha ganado relevancia en los últimos años.

El informe examina casos específicos donde los soldados habrían cometido estos actos, generando indignación y llamando a investigaciones exhaustivas para esclarecer los hechos y aplicar justicia. Este tipo de acusaciones refleja la brutalidad de ciertos episodios de la guerra, cuestionando el comportamiento de las tropas implicadas y la falta de supervisión adecuada.

Según la fiscal Carmen García, las investigaciones no tienen motivación política, sino que se centran en posibles actuaciones graves de corrupción. Los correos electrónicos intervenidos y los informes aportados por los Mossos d’Esquadra y la Agencia Tributaria sugieren la existencia de pagos realizados por compañías gasísticas a Equipo Económico, considerado el núcleo de la trama, antes de recibir favores administrativos. Asimismo, se detectó la elaboración de impuestos “a medida” para estas empresas. La Fiscalía sostiene que estos hechos deben investigarse a fondo y no deben trasladarse a tribunales de otra jurisdicción ni ser anulados.

Los agentes, que iban de paisano, le impidieron continuar con la actividad y la obligaron a regresar a su domicilio, lo que provocó un ataque de ansiedad que requirió atención hospitalaria. La tutora legal de Carmen, su hermana María, presentó una denuncia ante la Policía Nacional y una queja ante el Ayuntamiento, acompañada del parte médico. En la denuncia se describe un trato agresivo y desproporcionado por parte de los agentes, que incluso permanecieron frente a la vivienda para impedir que Carmen volviera a salir. La abogada de la afectada subraya que, aunque alimentar a las palomas pueda suponer una infracción administrativa, no justifica un trato intimidatorio hacia una persona vulnerable.

En Bilbao vive su hermano mayor, quien también habría sido abandonado de manera similar años atrás. Al llegar, la menor quedó sola y acudió a los Servicios Sociales, que activaron los protocolos de protección, derivándola primero a un hogar de acogida y luego a un centro tutelado por la autoridad competente. A finales de noviembre, la Unidad de Acogimiento Residencial alertó a la Policía de que los padres habían visitado inesperadamente a la menor en el centro.

Este impuesto, uno de los más regresivos del mundo, afecta por igual a todos los consumidores en productos básicos, lo que podría reducir el consumo y agravar la desigualdad. Aunque se presenta como una medida para reemplazar otros impuestos y mejorar la eficiencia económica, en la práctica los empresarios no suelen trasladar las reducciones fiscales a precios más bajos, mientras que los incrementos se aplican de inmediato al consumidor. El trasfondo de esta política refleja un modelo libertario donde la supuesta “libertad” se traduce en capacidad de pago, y los servicios públicos esenciales como salud, educación y alimentación quedan cada vez más sujetos a la lógica del mercado.

La protesta, debidamente comunicada, fue bloqueada por la policía, que retuvo a los manifestantes durante más de tres horas en un parking de la facultad de Derecho. Los colectivos denuncian que la actuación policial fue violenta, con cargas que causaron heridas a 12 personas, una de ellas trasladada al hospital, y múltiples identificaciones y retenciones arbitrarias. En contraste, se permitió la libre circulación de Vito Quiles y sus seguidores, llegando incluso a saltarse un cordón policial.

A través de una trabajadora social del centro especializado Cimascan, Sabina intentó durante años que la universidad adoptara medidas o investigara los hechos, pero la respuesta fue siempre negativa. La institución alegó que los casos de agresión sexual no podían tramitarse administrativamente, solo los de acoso, y que no existía una queja formal que activara su protocolo interno.

Sin embargo, en 2020 esa cifra se redujo al 4,3% a nivel mundial y apenas al 0,3% en países como Japón y Noruega. Esta notable disminución se debe a múltiples factores: mejoras en la nutrición, acceso a agua limpia, saneamiento, cuidados neonatales, vacunas, medicinas y reducción de la pobreza, conflictos y hambrunas. Antes de 1800, casi todos los padres perdían al menos un hijo; hoy en día, perder un hijo es una experiencia poco común. Los comentarios de los lectores resaltan ejemplos históricos y familiares que muestran cómo la mortalidad infantil afectaba generaciones pasadas, con niños falleciendo en la infancia o por enfermedades como la polio. Los testimonios también subrayan que gran parte del aumento de la esperanza de vida en el último siglo se debe a la reducción de muertes tempranas, más que a avances en la medicina para personas mayores.

Comienza explicando el origen del nombre 'manzana', derivado del latín *malum*, que significaba tanto 'manzana' como 'malo', y cómo la variedad cultivada por el botánico romano Gayo Macio, llamada *malum matianum*, dio lugar al término actual en castellano. A partir de ahí, el autor recorre tres episodios emblemáticos donde la manzana ha tenido un protagonismo trágico o simbólicamente poderoso: el mito del Jardín del Edén, la Guerra de Troya y el cuento de Blancanieves. En el primer caso, recuerda que la Biblia nunca menciona que el fruto prohibido fuera una manzana, sino que esa asociación surgió por una confusión lingüística en la traducción de San Jerónimo al latín. En el mito griego, la 'manzana de la discordia' lanzada por la diosa Eris desencadena la guerra de Troya tras el juicio de Paris en favor de Afrodita.

Este huevo, uno de los 50 huevos imperiales Fabergé creados para las últimas dos emperatrices rusas, fue diseñado por Alma Pihl y se distingue por su cubierta de cuarzo con incrustaciones de platino y más de 1.500 diamantes en corte rosa que simulan copos de nieve. El interior del huevo revela una cesta de platino y diamantes con flores de cuarzo talladas, cuyas hojas están esculpidas en nefrita y decoradas con granates demantoides.

Según el texto, las empresas deberán asegurar que el 85% de la población tenga acceso continuado a las telecomunicaciones, incluidas las llamadas de emergencia, durante al menos cuatro horas en caso de interrupción del suministro eléctrico.

El decreto establece tres niveles de exigencia: las infraestructuras críticas (como cables submarinos, centros de datos principales o nodos troncales) deberán mantener la operatividad durante 24 horas; las instalaciones intermedias, como los puntos de intercambio de Internet o sistemas satelitales, deberán garantizar 12]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-exige-a-las-operadoras-reforzar-sus-redes-frente-a-apagones-con-una-inversion-de-73-millones</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-gobierno-exige-a-las-operadoras-reforzar-sus-redes-frente-a-apagones-con-una-inversion-de-73-millones</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A un minuto del desastre: Chat Control convertirá cada móvil en un dispositivo de vigilancia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo analiza el sistema denominado Chat Control, que podría permitir la supervisión de comunicaciones en dispositivos móviles, y discute las implicaciones para la privacidad de los usuarios.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-un-minuto-del-desastre-chat-control-convertira-cada-movil-en-un-dispositivo-de-vigilancia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-un-minuto-del-desastre-chat-control-convertira-cada-movil-en-un-dispositivo-de-vigilancia</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 15:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exmiembros del Opus Dei denuncian explotación laboral y captación de mujeres en situación vulnerable]]></title><description><![CDATA[Exmiembros del Opus Dei en México han revelado un sistema de captación y explotación de mujeres, especialmente jóvenes de comunidades pobres, para servir como numerarias auxiliares en las casas y centros de la organización. Estas mujeres eran reclutadas bajo la promesa de educación y formación profesional, pero pronto eran obligadas a realizar tareas domésticas sin remuneración y bajo estricta obediencia religiosa. El trato desigual, la limitación de contacto con sus familias y la imposición de roles de servicio perpetuo caracterizaban este sistema. Testimonios detallan que las auxiliares trabajaban desde la mañana hasta la noche, con un ritmo inhumano y sin acceso a recreación, siendo en muchos casos sometidas a tratamientos psiquiátricos cuando mostraban dudas o rechazo a continuar. Las mujeres de clases altas podían aspirar a ser numerarias, mientras que las de menor nivel socioeconómico estaban destinadas de por vida a servir.

El texto sostiene que la clave no reside en el producto en sí, sino en el proceso mediante el cual se creó un mercado prácticamente inexistente. La empresa que lo comercializa, Netun Solutions, fundada por dos exguardias civiles y centrada en un único producto sin demanda previa significativa, habría mantenido su actividad gracias a la expectativa de un cambio normativo que finalmente llegó. Según la reflexión del autor, resulta improbable que una compañía apueste su supervivencia a un dispositivo sin presión social, sin necesidad técnica y sin proyección clara, a menos que existiera una información previa sobre una futura regulación.

Las autoridades explican que la PPA no supone riesgo para las personas, pero sí para la economía y las explotaciones porcinas. El informe destacaba que, aunque la densidad de jabalíes es elevada en el litoral catalán, la interacción entre cerdos domésticos y salvajes es relativamente baja, limitando la propagación a explotaciones agrícolas.

Estos intermediarios utilizan herramientas informáticas y bots para reservar múltiples citas, revendiéndolas después a quienes las necesitan con urgencia, lo que genera un colapso adicional en el servicio público. El Ministerio de Trabajo ha presentado denuncias ante la Policía y ha implementado medidas antifraude, como límites por DNI y liberación aleatoria de citas canceladas, aunque los sindicatos alertan de que la raíz del problema es la falta de personal. Entre 2022 y 2025, el SEPE ha perdido miles de empleados por jubilación y recortes, mientras la demanda de citas sigue creciendo.

Este resurgimiento ha generado tanto entusiasmo como preocupación, especialmente por los posibles ataques a personas y daños económicos en comunidades rurales. Sin embargo, los autores subrayan que gran parte del debate público se ha vuelto sensacionalista, polarizado y alejado de la evidencia científica. Las poblaciones de lobos y osos aumentan de manera gradual y desigual, y los ataques mortales a humanos son extremadamente raros. La investigación demuestra que las estrategias no letales —como cercados eléctricos, perros guardianes y vigilancia del ganado— son efectivas para reducir conflictos y promover la coexistencia.

La investigación, conocida como Strike Force Constantine, fue desarrollada por la Brigada de Delitos Sexuales de Nueva Gales del Sur y condujo a seis registros en los alrededores de Sídney el 27 de noviembre. En el domicilio de uno de los principales sospechosos, Landon Germanotta-Mills, de 26 años, se encontraron miles de vídeos que documentaban abusos de menores, incluidos bebés. Además, enfrenta cargos por posesión y difusión de material relacionado con la bestialidad. Los otros tres implicados son Stuart Woods Riches (39 años), Mark Andrew Sendecky (42 años) y Benjamin Raymond Drysdale (46 años).

A pesar de que la mujer borró el mensaje casi inmediatamente, el Tribunal Supremo consideró que se vulneraron los derechos de los menores a la intimidad y el secreto de sus comunicaciones. El padre, representante legal de los menores, interpuso una denuncia, lo que llevó a la sentencia de prisión, aunque la madre no tenía intención de difundir de manera permanente la grabación.

Según los audios, el objetivo sería aumentar el EBITDA de la empresa en cuatro o cinco millones de euros, aplicando ajustes estratégicos sobre la actividad quirúrgica y limitando la atención a pacientes que no pertenecen a la población asignada ('no cápita'). Gallart justifica estas medidas señalando que el hospital es deficitario y que los fondos recibidos de la administración no cubren los gastos operativos y financieros.

El tono del vídeo y su contenido han despertado indignación generalizada, ya que numerosos internautas consideran que el antiguo monarca no está en posición de dar lecciones de historia o ética a las nuevas generaciones.

Ceballos, de 54 años, ha vivido en Estados Unidos durante más de cinco décadas, sin saber que su estatus de inmigrante mexicano lo hacía inelegible para votar. A pesar de haber participado en elecciones desde 1991, ahora está siendo acusado de votar ilegalmente y de cometer perjurio electoral. Si se le encuentra culpable, podría enfrentar una condena de hasta 68 meses de prisión y multas de hasta 200.000 dólares. Además, el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional ha advertido sobre la posibilidad de iniciar un proceso de deportación, lo que podría cambiar drásticamente la vida de Ceballos, quien no habla español y no ha regresado a México desde su infancia. A pesar de ser un firme partidario de Trump, Ceballos expresa temor por la posible deportación y las consecuencias que tendría para su vida.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-alcalde-republicano-de-kansas-enfrenta-cargos-de-fraude-electoral-y-posible-deportacion-tras-50-anos-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-alcalde-republicano-de-kansas-enfrenta-cargos-de-fraude-electoral-y-posible-deportacion-tras-50-anos-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE.UU. busca recuperar una bomba sin explotar en Líbano para evitar que otras potencias accedan a su tecnología]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un incidente reciente en Líbano ha puesto en marcha una carrera entre potencias mundiales para encontrar una bomba guiada de precisión de origen estadounidense que no detonó tras un ataque. La GBU-39, un artefacto de 110 kg, cayó durante un ataque que mató al comandante de Hezbolá, Ali Tabatabai. La bomba, diseñada para atacar con precisión milimétrica, es una de las más avanzadas en el arsenal de EE.UU. y su pérdida podría tener implicaciones graves si llega a manos de potencias como Rusia, China o Irán. Aunque la bomba por sí sola no representa una amenaza inmediata, la información y tecnología que contiene, como algoritmos de guiado y materiales avanzados, podrían permitir a otros países replicar o contrarrestar el modelo estadounidense de ataque de precisión.

A pesar de la Revolución de julio de 1936, no solo continuó funcionando, sino que amplió su alcance, con nuevos focos de represión en distintos puntos de la ciudad. En este artículo, Agustín Guillamón narra varias historias relacionadas con este edificio emblemático de la represión franquista. Entre ellas, destaca la detención de trotskistas en febrero de 1938, implicando a Julián Grimau, quien sería posteriormente una figura clave en la lucha antifranquista. Además, se relata la huida de otros militantes, como el trotskista danés Kielso, entre la Plaza Berenguer y la Casa CNT-FAI, situada en Vía Layetana 32. El artículo también menciona la ocupación de edificios por parte de los cenetistas, que sin emplear violencia, se apoderaron de las antiguas sedes de la patronal catalana y La Lliga, creando un nuevo centro de resistencia con la CNT-FAI.

El evento, programado para el jueves 4 de diciembre en la Biblioteca Pública Infanta Elena, ha sido duramente criticado por colectivos feministas y organizaciones políticas como Adelante Andalucía. La protesta se centra en las afirmaciones del autor, que han sido acusadas de deslegitimar las denuncias de mujeres que sufren violencia de género, sugiriendo que estas denuncias son frecuentemente falsas y usadas con fines personales, como la custodia de hijos. Los detractores del evento argumentan que dar espacio institucional a estas ideas puede fomentar un clima de desconfianza hacia las víctimas. La polémica se suma a un contexto donde la violencia machista sigue siendo un problema grave en Andalucía, con trece feminicidios en 2025, lo que ha llevado a varios a cuestionar el papel de las in]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sevilla-se-moviliza-contra-la-presentacion-de-un-libro-que-cuestiona-las-denuncias-de-violencia-de-genero</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sevilla-se-moviliza-contra-la-presentacion-de-un-libro-que-cuestiona-las-denuncias-de-violencia-de-genero</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 02:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[India obliga a preinstalar una aplicación gubernamental en todos los móviles]]></title><description><![CDATA[El gobierno de Narendra Modi ha ordenado que todos los teléfonos móviles fabricados o importados a la India deben llevar preinstalada una aplicación gubernamental llamada Sanchar Saathi, que no podrá ser desactivada.

Además, otros partidos como el extinto GIL y Convergència también aparecen con cifras relevantes, pero es el PP el que destaca en número de casos abiertos.

Cristina Baldoví, una de las educadoras de la asociación, señala que solo un 5% de las participantes en actividades extraescolares son chicas, lo que refleja una clara desigualdad. A esto se suma la denuncia de varias jóvenes como Salma, de 17 años, quien explica cómo sus padres le impiden salir con sus amigas por motivos de religión o costumbres familiares.

Hernández fue extraditado en abril de 2022 y en marzo de 2024 fue condenado a 45 años de prisión por tres cargos de narcotráfico y armas, además de cinco años de libertad vigilada y una multa de ocho millones de dólares. Según las autoridades estadounidenses, Hernández habría recibido dinero del narcotraficante Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán para financiar fraudes electorales, participando en una conspiración que introdujo más de 500 toneladas de cocaína en Honduras. La liberación se produjo el 1 de diciembre de 2025 en una prisión federal de alta seguridad en Pensilvania. El indulto, anunciado días antes de las elecciones presidenciales hondureñas, ha generado críticas por debilitar la lucha contra el narcotráfico, aunque defensores de Hernández señalan posibles irregularidades en su juicio y alegan persecución ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-orlando-hernandez-expresidente-de-honduras-liberado-tras-recibir-un-indulto-presidencial-en-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/juan-orlando-hernandez-expresidente-de-honduras-liberado-tras-recibir-un-indulto-presidencial-en-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 00:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La separación de poderes en España: ¿realidad o ficción?]]></title><description><![CDATA[La separación de poderes es un principio fundamental en las democracias modernas que busca evitar la concentración de poder en una sola entidad. En España, la Constitución establece la división de poderes en tres ramas: legislativa, ejecutiva y judicial. Sin embargo, a pesar de la teoría, diversos factores políticos han diluido la independencia de estos poderes. La falta de independencia real del poder judicial, las interferencias del ejecutivo en el legislativo a través de decretos-ley y la elección política de los miembros clave del poder judicial muestran una realidad alejada de la separación de poderes ideal. En particular, los partidos políticos, tanto el PSOE como el PP, han sostenido un sistema que permite una influencia mutua entre los poderes, reduciendo la autonomía del judicial y la verdadera representación del poder legislativo.

La ofensiva se enmarcaría en la operación Lanza del Sur, un dispositivo militar del Pentágono que, hasta la fecha, ha destruido una veintena de embarcaciones en aguas del Caribe y el Pacífico y ha provocado la muerte extrajudicial de más de 80 personas señaladas como narcotraficantes.

En un reciente incidente, el expresidente Donald Trump propuso desnaturalizar a los inmigrantes nacionalizados que cometan delitos, mientras que la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, sugirió imponer una prohibición total de viajes a los países que envían criminales a EE. UU. Esta declaración de Noem se hizo después de un tiroteo en Washington, donde un refugiado afgano atacó a dos miembros de la Guardia Nacional, resultando en la muerte de uno y dejando al otro en estado crítico. La propuesta de Noem afectaría a numerosos países que, según ella, han 'inundado' el país con personas peligrosas. Además, la administración de Trump ha implementado medidas restrictivas, como la suspensión de visas y la revisión de residencias permanentes de ciudadanos de 19 países. El exmandatario también planteó la idea de una 'migración inversa', sugiriendo que se expulse a quiene]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-y-noem-refuerzan-las-medidas-de-seguridad-fronteriza-con-propuestas-extremas-contra-inmigrantes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-y-noem-refuerzan-las-medidas-de-seguridad-fronteriza-con-propuestas-extremas-contra-inmigrantes</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 22:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La ESA confirma que el primer astronauta europeo en orbitar la Luna será alemán en una misión Artemis]]></title><description><![CDATA[En la Conferencia Ministerial de 2025 de la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA) celebrada en Bremen, Alemania, se acordó un aumento récord del presupuesto de la ESA hasta 22.067 millones de euros para los próximos tres años, consolidando la mayoría de sus planes y proyectos espaciales.

La imagen, con el jefe del Pentágono y su esposa rodeados de sus hijos vestidos con camisas que muchos consideran de mal gusto, ha sido vista como una manifestación de valores 'clásicos'. Sin embargo, esta fotografía también ha destapado una realidad menos ejemplar: la vida personal del propio Hegseth, que se aleja de la imagen que muchos de sus seguidores quisieran ver. Las redes sociales han sacado a la luz sus comportamientos y decisiones fuera del ámbito público, generando debate sobre la hipocresía de aquellos que promueven la moral conservadora mientras llevan una vida privada controvertida.

En varios mensajes publicados en redes sociales, Dannon acusó a España de utilizar el certamen musical para promover una 'agenda extremista' y pidió que se centrara en la música en lugar de 'difundir odio'. Estas declaraciones se producen en medio de un creciente debate sobre la posible exclusión de Israel del concurso, motivado por las acusaciones de genocidio en Gaza y por el incumplimiento de las normas de la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER). RTVE, a través de su presidente José Pablo López, ha mantenido su postura firme de que España se retirará del festival si Israel participa, argumentando que el país asiático ha usado Eurovisión de forma política y ha intentado blanquear las acciones del Gobierno de Netanyahu.

La trabajadora denunció retrasos en el pago de sus nóminas entre diciembre de 2023 y junio de 2024, lo que llevó al tribunal a considerar que hubo un 'incumplimiento grave' por parte de Saldaña como empleadora. Tras no comparecer al juicio, la sentencia ha dictado que debe pagar 28.959,12 euros en indemnización más intereses y costas. A pesar de que Saldaña ocupa su cargo en la Diputación desde hace solo dos meses, el presidente de la institución, Miguel Ángel Valverde, mostró sorpresa por la noticia y aclaró que se trata de una situación vinculada a su actividad privada antes de acceder al cargo público.

Según ACO, esa convocatoria derivó en un asalto a las instalaciones universitarias, con actos de hostigamiento al profesorado y daños a la propiedad. La denuncia señala que los discursos y consignas promovidos por Quiles en redes sociales y actos públicos tenían un claro contenido ideológico y generaron un clima de confrontación.

Aunque esta expansión tiene una gran carga geopolítica detrás, la viabilidad económica del proyecto ha sido fuertemente cuestionada por su fundador, Morris Chang. Según Chang, el éxito de TSMC se debe a su ecosistema único y altamente concentrado en Taiwán, donde la cercanía de empresas y proveedores permite una eficiencia sin igual. En Arizona, la falta de infraestructura local y el elevado coste de producción están dificultando este objetivo, además de que el suministro de materias primas sigue dependiendo de Asia. El intento de replicar el modelo taiwanés en EE.UU. ha resultado ser más caro y con una menor eficacia.

Bardem criticó que los medios suelen centrarse en mostrar a jóvenes de extrema derecha como un fenómeno predominante, mientras que los jóvenes progresistas involucrados en causas medioambientales, sindicales o de justicia social no reciben la misma cobertura. Puso como ejemplo que cuando un individuo de extrema derecha provoca disturbios en una universidad, se muestran imágenes de estos pocos, pero no de los cientos o miles de estudiantes progresistas presentes.

El KPP es un pequeño partido sin representación parlamentaria, pero con una presencia activa en la calle, defendiendo causas como los derechos laborales y la crítica a la OTAN. La acción contra el KPP ha sido vista por algunos como un ejemplo de 'antitotalitarismo selectivo', ya que existen otros grupos de extrema derecha en el país que siguen operando sin restricciones.

Originalmente publicada por entregas en 1994 en la revista Top Cómics de Ediciones B y editada en formato álbum por Planeta con prólogo de Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, la obra ganó el premio a la mejor obra en el Salón del Cómic de Barcelona. La historia sigue a Enrique Montero, un maestro republicano depurado tras la dictadura franquista, obligado a trabajar como dibujante de tebeos mientras antiguos amigos antifascistas le contactan. La trama alterna su angustioso presente con las aventuras del personaje de cómic que dibuja, Pedro Guzmán, generando una reflexión sobre la memoria histórica y la influencia del pasado en el presente.

Estas embarcaciones, que parten del puerto israelí de Ashdod, transportan cloruro potásico y ácido fosfórico extraídos por filiales de la empresa israelí ICL, señalada por aprovechar recursos naturales del Mar Muerto y el Negev, ambos considerados territorios ocupados por la ONU. Pese al reciente Real Decreto-Ley del Gobierno español que establece un embargo a productos y empresas vinculadas con la ocupación, estos cargamentos llegarán a territorio estatal, lo que para el BDS demuestra la ineficacia de la normativa. 

Las empresas ERSHIP y FOMDESA serán las encargadas de gestionar la descarga, esta última vinculada directamente con ICL Iberia.

Los hechos ocurrieron en julio de 2023, después del cierre de la tienda. El empleado, con 16 años de servicio y un expediente laboral intachable, admitió haber tomado una croqueta de un blíster que iba a ser tirado a la basura. Mercadona consideró el acto como una falta muy grave, alegando transgresión de la buena fe contractual, y procedió a despedirle de forma inmediata, entregándole un finiquito de algo más de 900 euros. La empresa defendió que el trabajador había consumido un blíster completo valorado en 4,20 euros, mientras que el empleado insistió en que solo fue una croqueta. El Tribunal rechazó los argumentos de la empresa, calificando la sanción como desproporcionada, ya que el producto carecía de valor comercial y el acto no supuso mala f]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-superior-de-justicia-declara-improcedente-el-despido-de-un-trabajador-de-mercadona-por-comerse-una-croqueta-destinada-al-desecho</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-superior-de-justicia-declara-improcedente-el-despido-de-un-trabajador-de-mercadona-por-comerse-una-croqueta-destinada-al-desecho</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 18:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cataluña lidera la recaudación de Sucesiones y Donaciones con más de 1.000 millones en 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 2024, Cataluña alcanzó un récord histórico en la recaudación del impuesto de Sucesiones y Donaciones, superando por primera vez los 1.000 millones de euros, concretamente 1.111 millones, lo que supone un aumento del 16% respecto al año anterior y cuatro veces más que hace diez años. Esta cifra coloca a la región muy por delante de otras comunidades comparables, como Madrid, que ingresó 546 millones, y Andalucía, con 231 millones. Cataluña representa así el 35% del total recaudado en España por este impuesto, a pesar de aplicar deducciones para los familiares más cercanos. Sin embargo, estas bonificaciones son inferiores a las de otras comunidades, lo que hace que heredar en Cataluña sea más costoso que en la mayoría de regiones. Por ejemplo, un ciudadano que reciba 800.000 euros de herencia pagaría 44.569 euros en Cataluña, frente a 1.586 euros en Madrid o cero en Andalucía. La disparidad de tributación refleja también diferencias políticas, ya que comunidades gobernadas por el PSOE]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cataluna-lidera-la-recaudacion-de-sucesiones-y-donaciones-con-mas-de-1-000-millones-en-2024</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cataluna-lidera-la-recaudacion-de-sucesiones-y-donaciones-con-mas-de-1-000-millones-en-2024</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 17:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tres activistas de Futuro Vegetal se enfrentan a prisión por una protesta pacífica en Granada]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fiscalía de Granada ha solicitado una pena de dos años de prisión para tres activistas del grupo ecologista Futuro Vegetal, que en 2023 bloquearon la avenida de los Reyes Católicos durante la tercera cumbre de la Comunidad Política Europea. Los jóvenes, que se sentaron y pegaron sus manos al asfalto, desplegaron una pancarta con el mensaje “UE ecofascista” como forma de protesta simbólica no violenta. Según la organización, la acción no implicó violencia ni intimidación, sino que buscaba visibilizar la crisis climática, denunciar políticas extractivistas y reclamar justicia ecosocial. Futuro Vegetal denuncia que la petición de la Fiscalía forma parte de una represión sistemática contra el activismo ecosocial, recordando que en 2023 la Fiscalía incluso calificó erróneamente sus acciones como “actividad terrorista”, rectificando después la acusación.

Según la acusación, el episodio se produjo cuando los agentes pidieron a un cochero que recogiera los excrementos de sus animales y un vecino intervino criticando la grabación que realizaba uno de ellos. Ese vecino, que inicialmente salió corriendo por miedo a ser sancionado, regresó de forma pacífica, pero fue supuestamente reducido con violencia por uno de los policías, que lo estrelló contra una persiana y el suelo, aun estando esposado. Las imágenes captadas por la cámara de una farmacia demostraron la falsedad de la denuncia policial y motivaron el archivo de la causa contra el ciudadano y la apertura de diligencias contra los dos agentes implicados.

Se le reprocha hipocresía al defender la unidad entre mayores y jóvenes, cuando las políticas populares han recortado pensiones, ayudas sociales y precarizado servicios públicos. También alerta de sus falsas preocupaciones por el acceso juvenil a vivienda y natalidad, recordando que en regiones PP se privatizan viviendas protegidas y no aplican zonas tensionadas.

Esta iniciativa busca prolongar la vida útil de los objetos y combatir la obsolescencia programada, en lugar de fomentar la sobreproducción y el consumo desenfrenado. La campaña también tiene un componente de presión política, demandando que el Gobierno garantice el derecho a reparar y fomente productos más duraderos, sostenibles y reparables.

El equipo investigador identificó tres formas principales de tocamiento placentero: el 'tacto anal superficial' o 'anal surfacing', que consiste en caricias externas en la zona del ano sin penetrar; el 'tacto anal somero' o 'anal shallowing', que implica una penetración muy leve, hasta la yema de un dedo o el primer nudillo; y el 'maridaje anal' o 'anal pairing', que combina la estimulación anal con otros tipos de placer simultáneos, como la vaginal o clitoriana.

Los empleados acudieron como cada día a las siete de la mañana, pero encontraron las puertas cerradas. El malestar ha crecido entre los trabajadores, que acusan al empresario de una gestión arbitraria que pone en riesgo la continuidad de la planta. 
José Antonio Zan, portavoz de Industria de Comisións Obreiras en A Mariña, ha criticado duramente la decisión de García, calificándola como un “capricho de un niño pequeño” y señalando que la situación actual no deriva de una causa de fuerza mayor sino del incumplimiento de requerimientos de la Inspección de Trabajo, que instó a la empresa a aplicar medidas preventivas para garantizar la segur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-trabajadores-de-sargadelos-no-pueden-acceder-a-la-fabrica-tras-el-rechazo-del-erte-planteado-por-su-propietario</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-trabajadores-de-sargadelos-no-pueden-acceder-a-la-fabrica-tras-el-rechazo-del-erte-planteado-por-su-propietario</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 13:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ron Gilbert abandona aventuras por Death by Scrolling]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ron Gilbert, creador de clásicos como Maniac Mansion y la saga Monkey Island, presenta Death by Scrolling, un rogue-lite de acción y supervivencia que marca un giro radical tras 40 años en juegos de aventuras point-and-click. El juego, lanzado en octubre, consiste en correr por una pantalla que avanza hacia abajo mientras se esquivan enemigos y se recogen armas, con la novedad de huir de la Muerte personificada como un segador implacable. Gilbert explica que surgió de un prototipo de 2019 llamado 'Runner', inspirado en títulos como Binding of Isaac o Dead Cells, pero con menos caos visual que Vampire Survivors.

Antes de este proyecto, intentó un RPG de mundo abierto estilo Zelda con un equipo de tres personas, pero lo abandonó por falta de financiación.

Sin embargo, debido a la desidia de la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, Tauroni podría no devolver el dinero robado, a pesar de contar con tres informes que cuantifican el monto defraudado en entre tres y cinco millones de euros. La Audiencia, en una sentencia de 2020, condenó a los empresarios pero no fijó la responsabilidad civil, lo que ha generado un conflicto judicial. A pesar de que tanto la Fiscalía como la Abogacía de la Generalitat han recurrido esta decisión, la Audiencia no ha tomado medidas para restituir los fondos.

Además, Berezin señaló que el fraude contó con la participación de agentes vinculados a los servicios secretos rusos y al grupo de mercenarios Wagner. Esta revelación ha abierto nuevas líneas de investigación, demostrando las conexiones entre el crimen organizado y el aparato estatal ruso.

Wyden señaló que entre 2002 y 2016, JP Morgan solo reportó 4,3 millones en transacciones sospechosas, pero tras la detención de Epstein en 2019, se reportaron otras 5.000 transacciones por un valor total de 1.300 millones. Documentos recientes revelan que las cuentas de Epstein fueron supervisadas por ejecutivos sénior del banco, incluyendo al CEO Jamie Dimon. Además, se destaca la investigación en una transferencia de 158 millones a Epstein hecha por Leon Black, un inversor multimillonario, y se mencionan vínculos con bancos sancionados de Rusia.

El robo habría tenido lugar en 2020, cuando el grupo LuBian, uno de los mayores pools de minería de Bitcoin, sufrió un hackeo masivo, perdiendo más del 90% de sus fondos. Estos fondos, sin embargo, no fueron movidos durante varios años, hasta que, en junio de 2024, se realizó una transferencia a una nueva cartera. En octubre de 2025, el Departamento de Justicia de EE. UU. acusó a Chen Zhi, un empresario camboyano, de estar detrás de la operación. Según el DOJ, los fondos de Bitcoin robados están relacionados con Chen y su grupo criminal. China ha sugerido que este robo fue parte de una operación encubierta de ciberespionaje por parte del gobierno de EE. UU.

A partir del 17 de diciembre, los contratos formativos no podrán pagarse por debajo del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI), poniendo fin a la práctica de la 'mano de obra barata' disfrazada de prácticas profesionales. La medida, impulsada por el Ministerio de Trabajo, establece dos modalidades de contrato: formación en alternancia para estudiantes que compaginan estudios con trabajo remunerado, y obtención de práctica profesional para titulados que buscan experiencia laboral en su campo. 

Los contratos deberán formalizarse por escrito, contar con la participación de representantes sindicales y garantizar una remuneración digna, nunca inferior al SMI proporcional por hora.

Según Maldonado, esta metodología es obsoleta y limitada porque considera únicamente los ingresos monetarios en relación con una canasta básica de 52 alimentos, sin contemplar gastos fundamentales como servicios públicos, educación, salud, transporte y combustible. Esta medición oficial arroja una tasa de pobreza del 31,6% para 2025, pero otras mediciones multidimensionales, como la elaborada por la Universidad Católica Argentina, estiman que la pobreza real alcanza el 67,5%. El experto explica que cambiar la metodología tendría consecuencias políticas complicadas, ya que implicaría reconocer un porcentaje de pobreza mucho mayor, lo que demandaría mayores recursos para asignaciones y planes sociales.

Por su parte, Maduro habría solicitado una amnistía global para él y su grupo político, así como mantener el control sobre las fuerzas armadas, lo que fue rechazado por Trump. Fuentes consultadas por medios como el Miami Herald indican que la presión de EE.UU. incluye un despliegue naval masivo frente a la costa norte de Venezuela y el cierre total del espacio aéreo del país.

El uniforme, diseñado por Zelda Wynn Valdes, era un elemento esencial de su identidad: un corsé de satén a medida, orejas de conejo, pajarita, puños y una suave cola blanca. Todo ello debía combinarse con un maquillaje impecable, peinados cuidados y una presencia escénica sofisticada. Además del atuendo, las conejitas pasaban por un intenso entrenamiento.

Si bien la medida es positiva, se argumenta que hay problemas inmediatos más urgentes que Renfe debería abordar. En particular, la segmentación de sus servicios, como la creación de distintas categorías de trenes (AVE, Avant, Media Distancia, etc.), genera confusión y molestias entre los pasajeros, afectando la conveniencia y la flexibilidad. Además, se critica que los horarios de los trenes, especialmente en rutas menos frecuentadas como la de Valladolid-Madrid o Badajoz-Cáceres, son poco prácticos y no ofrecen un servicio eficiente. En estos trayectos, la opción más adecuada sería tener una tarifa única con trenes en horarios fijos, más cercanos a la demanda real de los usuarios. La propuesta es que Renfe deje de funcionar como una aerolínea y comience a ofrecer un servicio ferroviario más accesible y práctico para los viajeros cotidianos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renfe-debe-mejorar-la-frecuencia-y-flexibilidad-de-sus-servicios-regionales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/renfe-debe-mejorar-la-frecuencia-y-flexibilidad-de-sus-servicios-regionales</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 22:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nuevo servicio de tren de carga con horario regular entre Chongqing y Budapest fortalece el comercio internacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[Se ha lanzado un nuevo servicio de tren de carga con horario fijo entre Chongqing, China, y Budapest, Hungría, con el objetivo de mejorar las conexiones comerciales y logísticas entre ambos países. Este servicio ferroviario regular facilita el transporte de mercancías de manera más eficiente y predecible, promoviendo un intercambio económico más fluido a lo largo de esta ruta de transporte clave. El tren conecta directamente una de las principales ciudades industriales de China con la capital húngara, fortaleciendo los lazos comerciales y abriendo nuevas oportunidades para el comercio bilateral y transcontinental. Esta iniciativa se enmarca dentro de los esfuerzos para potenciar las infraestructuras de transporte y fomentar la cooperación internacional a través de rutas de carga terrestre que son estratégicas para la economía global actual.

En un contexto de creciente obesidad, que causó 3,7 millones de muertes en 2024, la OMS subraya que la obesidad es una enfermedad crónica que debe ser tratada de por vida. Los fármacos, como los que contienen GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy o Mounjaro), pueden ser eficaces, pero solo cuando se usan con supervisión médica y a largo plazo. Sin embargo, la OMS señala la gran desigualdad en el acceso a estos medicamentos, ya que, aunque su eficacia está probada, solo una pequeña parte de la población mundial tiene acceso a ellos. La organización alerta sobre la necesidad de mejorar el acceso a estos tratamientos para evitar que se profundicen las desigualdades económicas en la atención a la obesidad.

Tortosa denuncia cómo la extrema derecha, a través de medios de comunicación y una parte de la judicatura, está desestabilizando el país con el fin de tomar el poder, no solo en el ámbito político, sino también en el social y económico. A pesar de las victorias momentáneas de la derecha, el autor señala que la lucha es contra todos los ciudadanos que creen en los derechos democráticos, en especial en las áreas de pensiones, dependencia, educación y sanidad públicas.

Según el reporte, más de 80 personas han muerto desde principios de septiembre en operaciones antinarcóticos frente a Venezuela y Colombia. Tanto Hegseth como el presidente Trump han rechazado las acusaciones, calificándolas de falsas y defendiendo la legalidad de las acciones militares.

Aunque su significado actual se refiere a una expresión de sorpresa o incredulidad, su historia está relacionada con el término 'manda uebos', una versión romance de 'Mandat opus', que en el contexto medieval se utilizaba para expresar la necesidad de algo, es decir, 'la necesidad obliga'. La confusión con el término 'huevos' (genitales masculinos) es accidental, pero se ha aprovechado para dar una connotación más 'respetable' a la expresión. Así, el término 'huevos' ha derivado en otras expresiones que refieren a la virilidad o a la frustración, como 'tener los huevos por corbata' o 'tocar los huevos'.

Sin embargo, fuentes oficiales palestinas y organismos internacionales como la ONU y la UNRWA contradicen por completo esta versión.

Solo un 9% de los trabajadores del sector tiene menos de 30 años, lo que evidencia la falta de relevo generacional. La combinación de salarios ajustados, condiciones laborales duras y ausencia de formación suficiente ha generado un desajuste estructural que limita la contratación de jóvenes y la adopción de nuevas tecnologías. Los salarios han experimentado incrementos moderados debido al aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional y la presión por la escasez laboral, pero todavía resultan insuficientes para atraer a personal cualificado. La situación se agrava porque la mayoría de las empresas del sector son pymes o autónomos, incapaces de asumir costes salariales más altos, lo que provoca listas de espera y ralentiza el crecimiento del sector.

El contrato de alquiler especificaba que ciertos gastos individualizados, incluidos el IBI y las tasas de basuras, eran responsabilidad del arrendatario. Inicialmente, un juzgado dio la razón a los inquilinos alegando que la falta de especificación del importe anual invalidaba la obligación de pago. Posteriormente, la Audiencia Provincial de Palma de Mallorca revocó la decisión, considerando que estos tributos sí son individualizables y, por tanto, los inquilinos debían pagarlos. El Supremo ha respaldado esta postura, destacando que los tributos individualizados no requieren que se indique el importe exacto en el contrato.

Mientras escándalos del PSOE como el caso Koldo, con detalles sórdidos sobre Ábalos, Koldo García o Begoña Gómez, copan portadas y debates, Montoro queda en el ostracismo pese a su sofisticada trama: su bufete Equipo Económico cobró cientos de miles de euros de empresas gasísticas para que el Consejo de Ministros aprobara rebajas fiscales a medida, sin que pareciera soborno. Malvar lo compara con un Sinatra frente a bisbales vulgares, exaltando irónicamente su 'poesía' corruptora frente a la 'vulgaridad' de doblar calzoncillos en TV. Menciona también a Jorge Fernández Díaz, con 15 años de cárcel pendientes por un complot para manipular elecciones, ignorado igualmente.

Estas denuncias fueron presentadas de forma anónima hace cinco meses por militantes del PSOE que denunciaban comportamientos misóginos y acoso sexual mientras trabajaban bajo su supervisión. Las denuncias fueron registradas correctamente, pero cuando las denunciantes intentaron hacer seguimiento en octubre y noviembre, el sistema indicaba que no existían. La dirección del PSOE admite una 'falta de diligencia' y atribuye la desaparición de los registros a un error informático y a un sistema que entra en modo de 'ofuscación' para proteger datos tras tres meses. La investigación se considera innecesaria porque Salazar solicitó su baja como militante justo tras la consulta de elDiario.es.

Tras más de dos décadas trabajando como panadero, su pensión mensual asciende a 900 euros, calculada únicamente en función de los años cotizados. En la entrevista con NoticiasTrabajo, Oswaldo critica la desigualdad del sistema de pensiones, comparando su situación con la de los autónomos, quienes pueden trabajar 30 o 40 años y jubilarse con cantidades aún más bajas. Además, destaca la disparidad de salarios y coste de vida entre regiones y países europeos, mencionando que su hija en Francia gana más aunque los precios allí son mayores. Durante su etapa laboral, Oswaldo trabajaba jornadas extremadamente largas y nocturnas, de 12:30 de la noche a 12 del mediodía, cobrando 1.500 euros mensuales, aunque estima que el valor real de su trabajo debería haber sido de 2.000 a 2.500 euros por las horas extras no remuneradas.

Sin embargo, las investigaciones se cerraron debido a la prescripción de los delitos y a la inviolabilidad del monarca antes de su abdicación. En sus memorias, Juan Carlos I justifica algunos de sus ingresos como regalos según la tradición saudí y destaca su papel en proyectos internacionales como la promoción del AVE a La Meca.

Esta cuota supone el 0,10% de la base de cotización para el trabajador, mientras que la empresa aporta un 0,60%, sumando un total de 0,70%. Con un salario medio anual de 28.627 euros según el INE, esto equivale a unos 200 euros por trabajador al año: 29 euros del empleado y 171 de la empresa.

En el caso de Italia, los salarios reales han caído un 3,4% entre 1991 y 2023, mientras que en España la mejora ha sido mínima, con un aumento del poder adquisitivo de apenas un 2-3%. Las razones de este estancamiento se deben a un modelo productivo de bajo valor añadido, la debilidad de la negociación colectiva, la externalización de trabajos, y la devaluación del trabajo para ganar competitividad. Aunque en España el aumento del Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI) desde 2018 ha generado una mejora significativa para muchos trabajadores, esta subida no ha sido suficiente para alterar la estructura salarial desigual del país.

Para shows pequeños con 50-100 drones, el coste oscila entre 5.000 y 20.000 dólares, ideales para bodas o eventos íntimos de 5-10 minutos. Los medianos, con 100-500 drones, cuestan de 20.000 a 100.000 dólares y se usan en festivales o conciertos, con animaciones detalladas de 10-15 minutos. Los grandes, con más de 500 drones, superan los 100.000 dólares para celebraciones nacionales o corporativas, pudiendo durar más de 20 minutos.

Factores clave que influyen: personalización de diseños añade costes por programación extra; shows largos necesitan más baterías y logística; permisos y transporte varían por zona urbana o rural.

A lo largo de las conversaciones, el supuesto Momoa le pidió dinero, explicando que su fortuna estaba vinculada a proyectos cinematográficos y que no podía disponer de ella. La mujer, creyendo en la historia, vendió su casa en Cambridgeshire y transfirió el dinero al estafador. Tras el envío del dinero, la comunicación cesó y el falso actor desapareció. La policía ha advertido sobre este tipo de estafas, que apuntan a personas vulnerables.

Durante una inspección rutinaria, los guardabosques localizaron la tienda en un área remota, donde hallaron al hombre, que reaccionó de forma agresiva al ser abordado. Tras la intervención de la policía, se verificó que era la misma persona que había sido dada por muerta en los registros oficiales y para quien se había emitido un certificado de defunción. El hombre se encontraba viviendo en aislamiento voluntario, lo que confirma su deseo de permanecer oculto. La familia del desaparecido había denunciado su desaparición en 2008, pero las búsquedas no dieron resultado. En 2013, se tramitó su defunción. Ahora, las autoridades investigan cómo logró mantenerse oculto tanto tiempo y en qué condiciones ha vivido.

El detenido contactaba a través de redes sociales con personas en situación irregular que buscaban empleo, ofreciéndoles trabajos agrarios y de albañilería, pero una vez realizados los trabajos, no les pagaba. Las víctimas, que no firmaban contratos ni recibían medidas de seguridad en sus labores, intentaron varias veces cobrar, pero nunca obtuvieron el pago acordado. El total de la estafa asciende a 1.490 euros. Las víctimas, conscientes de su situación irregular, no denunciaban por miedo a represalias. La investigación se desarrolló en dos fases, logrando localizar a varias personas afectadas. El hombre fue detenido tras un dispositivo policial.

Expertos como Azahara Palomeque, Julen Bollain y Javier Carbonell coinciden en que factores como el origen socioeconómico, el género y el lugar de nacimiento determinan en gran medida las oportunidades, más que el esfuerzo personal. Un informe reciente de la OCDE indica que el 35% de la desigualdad de ingresos se debe a elementos hereditarios.[attached_file:1] En España, una familia de clase baja tarda más de un siglo en llegar a la clase media, según datos de 2019. Los jóvenes sufren especialmente: sueldos más bajos que los de sus padres pese a mayor formación, precariedad laboral y un mercado de trabajo débil con temporalidad alta. La vivienda representa un obstáculo clave, ya que las familias necesitan 7,7 años de salario para comprarla, el nivel más alto en 14 años, dedicando el 34,6% de ingresos a ella, lo que impide ahorrar o emanciparse.[attached_file:1]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-movilidad-social-en-espana-se-frena-origen-familiar-pesa-mas-que-el-merito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-movilidad-social-en-espana-se-frena-origen-familiar-pesa-mas-que-el-merito</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Las restricciones físicas de Trump a la prensa: un análisis de las ocho medidas más significativas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Desde el inicio de su segundo mandato, el presidente Donald Trump ha intensificado los ataques a la libertad de prensa, trascendiendo la retórica y las políticas públicas para implementar medidas físicas que limitan el acceso de los periodistas a lugares clave.

Además, se ha limitado el acceso a tribunales federales y a eventos del Pentágono, con la intención de reducir la presencia de la prensa en espacios donde se toman decisiones cruciales.

El tribunal ha dictaminado que la mujer mantenía una convivencia estable con una nueva pareja, lo que constituye causa suficiente para extinguir dicha pensión conforme al artículo 101 del Código Civil. La resolución se ha basado en un informe elaborado por un detective privado, en el que se demostraba que la mujer residía habitualmente en la vivienda de su nueva pareja. Además, el informe confirmó que la casa donde estaba empadronada tras el divorcio se encontraba alquilada, y que una agencia inmobiliaria corroboró ese extremo. Con estos elementos, la Audiencia consideró probada una convivencia de tipo marital, pública y duradera —conocida en derecho como 'more uxorio'—, lo que justifica la eliminación de la pensión sin necesidad de acreditar una mejora económica derivada de la relación.

Esto ocurre porque el meridiano de Greenwich dejó de ser el meridiano cero hace décadas. Históricamente, el meridiano cero era arbitrario y variaba según el país: en Francia se usaba el de París, en España el de El Hierro y en Reino Unido el de Greenwich. En 1884, la Conferencia del Meridiano de Washington estableció el de Greenwich como referencia global para mapas y tiempo universal, gracias al avance tecnológico británico. Sin embargo, a finales de los años 50, el lanzamiento del Sputnik por la URSS impulsó en EE.UU. el desarrollo de satélites Transit en la Universidad Johns Hopkins de Baltimore, creando el primer sistema de posicionamiento satelital entre 1964 y 1968.

Este declive se debe en gran parte a un cambio en los hábitos de consumo, especialmente entre los jóvenes, que han adoptado un estilo de vida más saludable desde la pandemia. La tendencia hacia la abstinencia entre los adolescentes es notable, con un descenso del 24% en los últimos 30 años en el número de jóvenes que se emborrachan regularmente. A pesar de la reducción en los precios del alcohol, los consumidores no muestran señales de volver al consumo masivo, lo que ha afectado gravemente a marcas como Pernod Ricard y Diageo.

Desde los propietarios de esclavos en el sur durante la época colonial hasta los industriales de la Edad Dorada y el Partido Republicano contemporáneo, todos han buscado reducir la capacidad del Estado para recaudar impuestos y financiar sus políticas. El gobierno de Trump, con sus políticas fiscales y arancelarias erráticas, continúa esta tradición de debilitar la administración fiscal del país.

El problema, según él, no radica en la táctica, sino en la estrategia y el relato del partido. En lugar de construir un mensaje positivo y propositivo, el PP sigue centrado en atacar a Pedro Sánchez, sin ofrecer una alternativa clara o una visión de futuro para el país. Esto, afirma Sánchez, está agotando a sus seguidores, ya que las continuas protestas no generan cambios visibles ni avances en sus objetivos. Además, sostiene que cada nueva manifestación refuerza la imagen de un PP impotente y atrapado en un bucle emocional.

De acuerdo con un informe de la inmobiliaria Lucas Fox, casi cuatro de cada diez viviendas de lujo adquiridas en España son para primera residencia, una tendencia impulsada por nómadas digitales, emprendedores y ciudadanos de América Latina, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Las ciudades como Madrid, Barcelona y Málaga están viendo el crecimiento más notable en este tipo de compras. Este fenómeno se ve reforzado por las políticas migratorias de países como Estados Unidos, que están impulsando a empresarios y estudiantes a buscar en España un nuevo hogar.

Esta cifra, una estimación conservadora, supera el techo presupuestario del Ministerio de Defensa, estancado en unos 14.000 millones debido a la ausencia de Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Las aprobaciones incluyen proyectos como fragatas F-110, vehículos blindados Dragón, drones Euromale RPAS, aviones Eurofighter en el Programa Halcón, misiles Nasams, satélites PAZ II y el controvertido FCAS, un caza europeo de sexta generación, con compromisos que se extienden hasta 2042 [attached_file:1].

El aumento se aceleró desde 2022, impulsado por la guerra en Ucrania y el compromiso OTAN del 2% del PIB en defensa, que España prevé alcanzar en 2025 con unos 33.000 millones, duplicando el 0,92% de 2014.

Esta cifra, un récord absoluto, pone de manifiesto el aumento de la violencia extrema de los colonos, que no solo agreden a palestinos, sino que también atacan a las propias tropas israelíes. A pesar de que el gobierno de Netanyahu ha prometido una 'mano dura' contra estos extremistas, el conflicto parece haber alcanzado un punto crítico. La violencia, que incluye desde quemas hasta asesinatos, tiene su epicentro en las microcolonias ilegales, apoyadas por el gobierno, y ha desbordado las fronteras de Cisjordania. El gobierno israelí se enfrenta a una grave crisis, en la que los propios ministros de seguridad, ligados a los asentamientos, parecen estar más comprometidos con el proyecto colonial que con la resolución de la violencia.

A nivel global, la humanidad está utilizando los recursos naturales a un ritmo 1,8 veces superior a la capacidad de regeneración de la Tierra. Uruguay, sin embargo, destaca como un modelo positivo debido a su transición energética, que ha logrado que el 99,1% de su electricidad provenga de fuentes renovables. A través de su experiencia, Wackernagel señala que si todos los países siguieran el ejemplo de Uruguay, el planeta entraría en déficit ecológico mucho más tarde, lo que permitiría un uso más sostenible de los recursos. La clave de esta transformación en Uruguay fue una combinación de políticas públicas de largo plazo, una gobernanza de colaboración público-privada y una profunda revisión del marco regulatorio para facilitar el uso de energías renovables.

Este acuerdo ha reavivado la polémica sobre la adquisición de la entidad en 1992 por parte de Jesús Gil y Enrique Cerezo, quienes accedieron a la propiedad en un proceso judicialmente calificado como un “fraude de ley”. A pesar de que los tribunales confirmaron que el proceso de compra fue ilegal, las acciones de los nuevos propietarios fueron prescritas, lo que permitió que continuaran al frente del club. Este caso se remonta a la conversión del Atlético de Madrid en una Sociedad Anónima Deportiva, cuando las autoridades deportivas permitieron que Gil y Cerezo se hicieran con el control del club a través de un complejo entramado financiero.

Entre 2010 y 2017, se pasó de un proceso de absorción de CO2 a una emisión neta de gases de efecto invernadero. Esto se debe principalmente a la destrucción de la selva tropical del Congo, la segunda más grande del mundo después del Amazonas, que ha experimentado una deforestación masiva debido a la tala ilegal y la minería. De hecho, entre 2011 y 2017, los bosques africanos perdieron 106 millones de toneladas de biomasa por año, lo que equivaldría a la emisión de unos 200 millones de toneladas de CO2. Este cambio pone en peligro los esfuerzos globales para reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, ya que la región, anteriormente un importante sumidero de carbono, ahora se ha convertido en una fuente de emisiones.

El incremento de la demanda, impulsado por políticas de gratuidad parcial, bonificaciones y un cambio social hacia la movilidad sostenible, ha superado la capacidad de autobuses, metro y trenes de cercanías. Sin embargo, las inversiones para mejorar el servicio no han acompañado este auge. Según un estudio de la Universitat de València, el tráfico rodado en accesos y zonas internas de la ciudad ha caído notablemente desde 2008, mientras que el uso de bicicletas y transporte colectivo se ha disparado. Aun así, la oferta de transporte por habitante sigue siendo menos de la mitad de la de Madrid o Barcelona.

Este término, originado en la Alemania nazi, describe un sistema jurídico en el que las leyes se aplican de manera desigual según la pertenencia a ciertos colectivos. En su artículo 14, la Constitución española garantiza la igualdad ante la ley, pero la sentencia de 2008 en el caso de la Ley de Violencia de Género ha alterado este principio, aplicando un doble Derecho Penal que favorece a ciertos grupos mientras discrimina a otros, como el colectivo LGTBI+. Los críticos, como el autor Juan Soto Ivars, denuncian que este tipo de legislación ha llevado a la creación de un Derecho Penal de Autor, donde los acusados son tratados no según sus actos, sino según su pertenencia a un grupo determinado. Además, esta sentencia ha sido vinculada con otros problemas sistémicos, como el uso político de la ley y la corrupción, que afectan la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derecho-degenerado-y-la-sentencia-que-altera-los-derechos-fundamentales-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-derecho-degenerado-y-la-sentencia-que-altera-los-derechos-fundamentales-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 20:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detenido en Las Palmas un falso representante deportivo acusado de abusar y corromper a 61 menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía ha detenido en Las Palmas a un hombre que se hacía pasar por representante deportivo y que está acusado de abusar sexualmente y corromper a 61 menores de edad. El arrestado utilizaba su falsa identidad para ganarse la confianza de los menores, lo que le permitía contactar con ellos y someterlos a abusos, además de facilitar actividades ilegales relacionadas con la corrupción de menores. La investigación policial sacó a la luz esta trama tras varias denuncias y análisis de dispositivos electrónicos que revelaron imágenes y comunicaciones comprometedoras. El arrestado ha sido imputado por delitos graves contra la integridad sexual y la corrupción de menores, y el caso está siendo gestionado con especial protección a las víctimas para preservar su anonimato y bienestar.

Este acuerdo tiene como objetivo mejorar la imagen del país en el extranjero, especialmente en el contexto de su conflicto con Palestina. La estrategia incluye el pago de estas sumas a personas con miles de seguidores para que difundan mensajes que favorezcan la postura israelí. La iniciativa ha generado controversia, con algunos críticos afirmando que se trata de una forma encubierta de propaganda, mientras que otros defienden la libertad de expresión de los influencers. A pesar de la oposición, la medida sigue en marcha, con la promesa de que será aplicada de forma transparente.

Según el estudio, más del 40% del suelo en España presenta signos de deterioro, lo que podría tener consecuencias dramáticas si no se toman medidas urgentes. El 43,35% del país, aproximadamente 206.000 km², ya muestra indicios de desertificación, y las zonas áridas son las más afectadas, con un alarmante 60,94%. El informe también destaca la vulnerabilidad de áreas como la Región de Murcia, donde un 91% de su superficie está en proceso de degradación. La principal causa de esta situación no es solo el cambio climático, sino también la sobreexplotación de recursos hídricos y el uso intensivo del suelo.

García desaconsejó la medida al considerarla un 'lío jurídico'. Pradas había intentado contactar previamente con Mazón a las 19:10 y 19:36 sin éxito, ya que el entonces president estaba con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana en El Ventorro y no llegó al Palau de la Generalitat hasta las 20:00 horas. En el Cecopi, la propuesta de confinamiento surgió tras descartar evacuaciones por el jefe de bomberos José Miguel Basset, quien las vio contraproducentes.

Según el texto, el bloque europeo se encuentra inmerso en una 'tormenta perfecta': la pérdida de competitividad frente a Estados Unidos y China, la exclusión de las negociaciones de paz sobre Ucrania impulsadas por Washington y Moscú, el auge de la extrema derecha euroescéptica y la falta de una política común de defensa y seguridad. Todo ello deja a la UE en una posición de debilidad geopolítica. 

A pesar de los intentos por reforzar su autonomía estratégica —con un aumento del gasto militar, reformas para reducir la burocracia y la negociación de acuerdos comerciales como el de Mercosur—, las acciones concretas no alcanzan para invertir la tendencia.

El experimento continuó con cheques de mayor valor, pero el porcentaje de cobros fue decreciendo a medida que la cantidad aumentaba. Los resultados revelaron una relación psicológica de los millonarios con el dinero: independientemente de la cantidad, siempre existe la motivación por obtener más, incluso si es a costa de un esfuerzo mínimo. Entre los que cobraron los cheques más pequeños destacan nombres como Donald Trump, quien no dudó en aprovechar hasta la más mínima oportunidad de ganar dinero.

Calhoun en la década de 1970 para estudiar los efectos del hacinamiento en una colonia de ratones. En un entorno controlado donde se ofrecía comida, agua y refugio en abundancia, cuatro parejas de ratones fueron introducidas para reproducirse sin limitaciones externas. Al principio, la población creció rápidamente y parecía una utopía, pero pronto se observaron comportamientos sociales destructivos como violencia, agresividad, aislamiento y pérdida de la función reproductiva. La sobrepoblación provocó un colapso social en la colonia, con consecuencias que llevaron a la extinción de la población. Este experimento ha sido interpretado como una advertencia sobre los riesgos del hacinamiento y la falta de recursos sociales y psicológicos en sociedades humanas. Fue significativo para la comprensión del comportamiento social en condiciones extremas de densidad poblacional.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-experimento-universo-25-el-colapso-social-de-una-colonia-de-ratones-por-sobrepoblacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-experimento-universo-25-el-colapso-social-de-una-colonia-de-ratones-por-sobrepoblacion</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 14:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PSOE se divide sobre la compra de vivienda por fondos buitres y su postura ante Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[El PSOE ha generado controversia en España tras su abstención en una votación crucial en el Congreso sobre la regulación de los fondos buitres y su compra de viviendas. Mientras que Sumar presentó una propuesta para frenar la especulación inmobiliaria y limitar la compra de viviendas por parte de fondos y empresas, el PSOE mostró su apoyo a la medida solo en Europa, pidiendo que la Unión Europea permita a los gobiernos nacionales frenar la compra especulativa en zonas tensionadas. Este desacuerdo interno dentro de la coalición ha puesto en evidencia la falta de consenso sobre cómo afrontar la crisis de la vivienda en España. A pesar de las propuestas de Sumar y otros partidos como ERC, Bildu y Podemos, el PSOE se ha mostrado más cauteloso, defendiendo un enfoque que dé prioridad a la seguridad jurídica y la cooperación con Europa.

El contrato establecía que la agencia cobraría una comisión del 4,8% únicamente si encontraba un comprador. Sin embargo, el comprador apareció por una vía completamente distinta, a través de un conocido del propietario, lo que permitió cerrar la operación sin la intervención de la inmobiliaria. Aun así, la agencia aseguró que, al no haberse encargado de la venta, solo facturaría los “servicios realizados”, entre ellos la publicación del anuncio, la gestión de visitas y el filtrado de potenciales interesados.

La sorpresa llegó cuando el propietario recibió la factura detallada, que incluía conceptos como visitas valoradas en 825 euros, filtrado económico por 160 euros o cuotas de mantenimiento del anuncio. En total, 1.900 euros más IVA.

La investigación revela que los acusados conocían a la víctima desde 2023 y aprovecharon su vulnerabilidad emocional, generada por supuestos ruidos de origen 'sobrenatural', para manipularla. Los pastores habrían convencido a la anciana de que debía abandonar su hogar para protegerse, llevándola a la iglesia y luego a firmar un boleto de compraventa con la promesa de un pago que nunca se completó. Posteriormente, la mujer fue trasladada a la casa de la madre de la imputada, donde permaneció incomunicada y sin acceso a sus documentos ni a su jubilación. La Policía intervino tras la denuncia de una sobrina al observar movimientos extraños en la propiedad.

El delfín de nariz de botella, conocido científicamente como Sousa sahulensis, busca una esponja, la arranca del fondo marino y la coloca sobre su cabeza para impresionar a las hembras. Este comportamiento, considerado como una demostración de fuerza, coordinación y resistencia, revela una complejidad social y cultural inédita en mamíferos marinos no humanos. Los científicos de la Universidad de Australia Occidental han documentado este ritual como un acto multimodal que combina señales visuales, táctiles y acústicas. Aunque esta práctica pueda parecer extraña, se trata de una forma de cortejo que muestra la capacidad del macho para realizar tareas difíciles, lo que lo convierte en un candidato ideal para la reproducción.

La solicitud de la ETA deberá realizarse de forma digital, antes del viaje, a través de la aplicación o página web oficial 'UK ETA'. La autorización tendrá una validez de dos años, o hasta la fecha de caducidad del pasaporte utilizado. Es importante destacar que, aunque se obtenga la ETA, no garantiza la entrada al país, ya que la decisión final depende del control fronterizo británico. Este cambio se implementa como parte de un esfuerzo por reforzar la seguridad en las fronteras británicas, tras la salida del Reino Unido de la Unión Europea.

Habitualmente, las restricciones de tráfico aéreo y marítimo sólo se aplicaban cuando el presidente se encontraba en la zona, pero el Servicio Secreto ha instaurado recientemente restricciones permanentes hasta, al menos, octubre del próximo año. Esto ha provocado que aviones sobrevuelen las viviendas desde las 5:30 a.m. hasta las 11 p.m., generando ruido y contaminación, y disminuyendo hasta un 20% el valor de las propiedades afectadas. A lo largo de los años, Trump ha intentado desviar el tráfico aéreo mediante demandas contra el condado y el aeropuerto, algunas de las cuales se resolvieron parcialmente a su favor. Ahora, con la implementación de estas restricciones temporales, los residentes temen que puedan volverse permanentes, afectando tanto a quienes apoyan al expresidente como a quienes]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-de-vuelo-sobre-mar-a-lago-generan-molestias-entre-los-vecinos-de-palm-beach</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restricciones-de-vuelo-sobre-mar-a-lago-generan-molestias-entre-los-vecinos-de-palm-beach</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 02:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Protestas y boicots a empresas por su colaboración con ICE]]></title><description><![CDATA[Varias empresas estadounidenses, como Home Depot, AT&T y Amazon, están siendo objeto de protestas y campañas de boicot por su colaboración con agencias de inmigración, especialmente ICE, en la ejecución de programas de deportación masiva durante la administración de Donald Trump.

Aunque en el pasado fue una crítica abierta de Donald Trump, Lawrence reconoce que los famosos no influyen en el voto de la gente y teme que sus opiniones solo contribuyan a la polarización del país. En la conversación, la actriz explicó que atraviesa un proceso de 'recalibración' artística y prefiere que su postura política no aleje al público de sus películas, que buscan impactar y generar reflexión. 

Lawrence también comentó que utiliza su trabajo y los proyectos de su productora, como la película 'Bread and Roses' y el documental 'Zurawski v.

La actriz reconoció haberse tomado un descanso de Hollywood debido al agotamiento y a la presión mediática, y afirma que ahora se siente más madura y reserva]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jennifer-lawrence-reflexiona-sobre-su-decision-de-mantenerse-al-margen-de-la-politica-y-expresarse-a-traves-del-cine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jennifer-lawrence-reflexiona-sobre-su-decision-de-mantenerse-al-margen-de-la-politica-y-expresarse-a-traves-del-cine</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 01:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Regulación de los insultos en el Fuero de Madrid (siglo XIII)]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Fuero de Madrid, un documento legal otorgado por Alfonso VIII en 1202 y vigente hasta 1346, ofrece una visión de la vida cotidiana en el Madrid medieval. En él se detallan las sanciones por insultos y difamaciones, un aspecto clave para la protección del honor. Los términos prohibidos incluyen insultos sexuales y ataques al honor, como 'puta', 'hija de puta', 'sodomita' y 'cornudo', que eran motivo de multa si se probaban. El Fuero establece que si las palabras eran discutidas en juicio, se debía pagar una multa al demandante si se confirmaba el insulto, y si no se podía probar, se podía jurar sobre la cruz. Esta normativa revela cómo la sociedad medieval valoraba el honor y cómo se gestionaban las disputas verbales en la villa de Madrid. El documento se conserva en el Archivo de la Villa de Madrid y es una fuente importante para entender la regulación social y moral de la época.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/regulacion-de-los-insultos-en-el-fuero-de-madrid-siglo-xiii</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/regulacion-de-los-insultos-en-el-fuero-de-madrid-siglo-xiii</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 01:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turull rechaza la petición de Feijóo a los empresarios catalanes y descarta apoyar una moción de censura]]></title><description><![CDATA[El secretario general de Junts, Jordi Turull, ha respondido con dureza a Alberto Núñez Feijóo después de que el líder del Partido Popular instara a los empresarios catalanes a presionar a Junts y ERC para respaldar una eventual moción de censura contra Pedro Sánchez.

Este concepto no se limita a una ambición territorial, sino que reúne elementos religiosos, ideológicos y geopolíticos que, según el texto, han moldeado la expansión israelí desde 1948. Basado en interpretaciones bíblicas como las del Génesis o el Deuteronomio, el 'Gran Israel' se describe como una visión que abarca territorios más amplios que los actuales límites de Israel, incluyendo partes del Líbano, Siria, Jordania y Egipto. A lo largo del siglo XX, líderes sionistas como Chaim Weizmann y David Ben-Gurion defendieron la idea de avanzar de forma gradual, consolidando el Estado como plataforma para futuras expansiones.

Estas condiciones incluyeron microgravedad, temperaturas extremas, vacío absoluto y radiaciones cósmicas intensas. Sorprendentemente, más del 80% de las esporas mantuvieron su viabilidad, y el 91% de ellas germinaron con éxito al regresar a la Tierra, contradiciendo expectativas de destrucción total. El análisis mostró solo una reducción del 20% en clorofila, sin impacto en la vitalidad, gracias a los esporofitos que actúan como escudos contra UV y otros daños. En laboratorio, estas esporas resistieron -196°C por más de una semana y 55°C por un mes, superando incluso a bacterias extremófilas.

Aunque el beneficio económico es un factor importante, no es la única razón. Según el abogado Miquel Àngel Mas, muchos propietarios se ven obligados a vender por falta de recursos financieros, especialmente en casos de herencias, donde los herederos no pueden permitirse comprar la parte que les correspondería. También las separaciones influyen en estas ventas, ya que cuando los hijos son pequeños, es habitual que uno de los progenitores permanezca en la vivienda, pero los altos precios obligan a vender cuando esta situación termina. Este fenómeno, que comenzó en áreas con alta demanda extranjera, se está extendiendo ahora también a Palma.

Según el artículo 22 del Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias, los poderes públicos deben garantizar el derecho a una vivienda digna y regular su función social, evitando la especulación. Sin embargo, Canarias cuenta con menos del 1% de vivienda pública, muy por debajo del 19% de media europea, y las medidas adoptadas por el actual Gobierno no parecen abordar el problema de manera efectiva. La negativa a declarar zonas tensionadas, la sanción a propietarios en zonas turísticas y la priorización de la vivienda privada sobre la pública son algunos de los ejemplos que evidencia la falta de acción.

La esperada visita generó una gran expectación en la ciudad, al punto de provocar una confusión divertida. Un hombre de pelo blanco y gafas fue rodeado y fotografiado en el centro sanitario por decenas de personas que lo confundieron con Gere. Según se aprecia en un vídeo difundido por Onda Regional, el hombre, que lucía una melena plateada similar a la del actor, reaccionó con humor ante la situación mientras los curiosos tomaban fotos y vídeos creyendo que se trataba del protagonista de ‘Oficial y caballero’. Pese al malentendido, el verdadero Richard Gere sí se encontraba en Murcia y tenía previsto participar esa misma tarde, a las siete, en el encendido del gran árbol de Navidad ubicado en la Plaza Circular.

Gracias a la organización vecinal, lograron cerrar la planta y restaurar la gestión hídrica local. Entre sus iniciativas destacan la limpieza de torrentes, la restauración de bancales agrícolas con pendiente inversa para facilitar la infiltración de agua al subsuelo y la construcción de depósitos que favorecen la biodiversidad y recargan el acuífero.

Esta decisión se enmarca en un conflicto que se remonta a 2023, cuando una similar exposición satánica se instaló junto a un belén cristiano, lo que provocó vandalismo por parte de un extremista cristiano, Michael Cassidy, quien se declaró culpable de un delito menor. En lugar de sancionar al agresor, las autoridades republicanas han endurecido las normas: limitaron los eventos a un día al año por grupo y prohibieron contenidos 'obscenos', cambios que parecen dirigidos específicamente contra los satanistas.

Miguel Ángel Simón, director del proyecto europeo Life+ Iberlince, destaca que este logro es fruto de 15 años de trabajo centrados en la reintroducción de ejemplares nacidos en cautividad en su hábitat natural. Desde la primera suelta en Córdoba en 2010 y en Jaén en 2011, se han consolidado poblaciones estables y conectado distintas áreas, lo que permite un intercambio genético fundamental para la supervivencia de la especie.

Kuyateh había huido hace tres décadas de la guerra civil en Sierra Leona y se había establecido en el área de Washington D. C., donde trabajaba como enfermera y cuidaba de su familia. En julio de 2025 acudió, como cada año, a su cita con el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE), pero en esta ocasión fue detenida y trasladada primero a una instalación en Maryland y luego a otra en Luisiana. Su abogada aseguró que un juez había dictado una orden prohibiendo su devolución a Sierra Leona por riesgo de tortura, pero las autoridades estadounidenses buscaron otros destinos para expulsarla. Finalmente, fue enviada a Ghana, donde afirma haber sido encadenada de pies y manos durante todo el vuelo.

Basta con una comunicación previa por escrito al presidente o administrador de la comunidad, informando del inicio de las obras y las características técnicas de la instalación.

Esta excepción busca fomentar la movilidad eléctrica ante el creciente número de coches eléctricos, diferenciándose de otras modificaciones en elementos comunes, como el cambio de suelo en terrazas o cerramientos, que sí requieren acuerdo comunitario.

Se citan como ejemplo las declaraciones del presidente del tribunal, que llegó a bromear diciendo que debía terminar pronto 'para poner la sentencia del Fiscal General'. Además, se menciona su participación en un curso organizado y financiado por la parte acusadora, el Colegio de Abogados de Madrid. Todo ello vulneraría, según los autores, el artículo 24 de la Constitución Española, que garantiza el derecho a la tutela judicial efectiva y a un juicio imparcial.

La región continúa enfrentando problemas estructurales como el desempleo, que se mantiene por encima de la media nacional, y un modelo económico dependiente de sectores primarios y turísticos con bajo valor añadido, lo que contribuye a la desigualdad y a la exclusión social. El informe Foessa señala que Andalucía presenta un sistema productivo menos desarrollado, traducido en menor calidad de vida y mayor exclusión, con dificultades especialmente graves para los hogares con ingresos bajos. En cuanto a los servicios públicos esenciales, la sanidad ha experimentado un notable deterioro: las listas de espera se han incrementado, con más de un millón de personas pendientes de atención médica o quirúrgica, y los problemas en programas clave, como la detección precoz del cáncer de mama, han puesto en evidencia la presión sobre ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluacion-de-siete-anos-de-gobierno-de-moreno-bonilla-en-andalucia-sanidad-empleo-y-desigualdad-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/evaluacion-de-siete-anos-de-gobierno-de-moreno-bonilla-en-andalucia-sanidad-empleo-y-desigualdad-social</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacer Nación se disuelve y parte de su dirección pasa a Vox y Solidaridad]]></title><description><![CDATA[La organización neofascista Hacer Nación (HN), creada en 2020 a partir de la unión de diversos colectivos de extrema derecha, ha cesado su actividad según la investigación del blog antifascista Sistema 161.

La investigación, dirigida por Santiago F. González, revela que la tinta de los tatuajes no permanece únicamente en la piel, sino que se desplaza rápidamente hacia los ganglios linfáticos, acumulándose en grandes cantidades. Los macrófagos, células inmunitarias responsables de eliminar agentes extraños, capturan activamente los pigmentos de la tinta, lo que provoca una respuesta inflamatoria en dos fases: una fase aguda de aproximadamente dos días y una fase crónica que puede durar años. Esta acumulación repetida y la muerte de macrófagos pueden debilitar la capacidad del sistema inmunitario, aumentando la vulnerabilidad frente a infecciones y ciertos tipos de cáncer.

El joven, condenado a once años y medio de prisión por la Audiencia Provincial de Pontevedra, huyó del país tras conocer la sentencia, desplazándose primero a Oporto y después a Zúrich antes de volar a su país natal. Allí permaneció hasta que fue detenido en septiembre en San Pedro de Macorís, en una operación coordinada entre la Policía dominicana y la Interpol. La captura se produjo a petición de las autoridades españolas, que habían emitido una orden internacional de detención y solicitaban su extradición. Tras la resolución favorable de la Suprema Corte de Justicia dominicana, se completó su traslado a Madrid, donde ingresará en prisión a la espera de su derivación a Vigo.

Comienza recordando episodios históricos como la Guerra del Peloponeso, la Reforma Protestante, la Revolución Francesa y la Guerra de Secesión estadounidense, entre otros, en los que la confrontación ideológica provocó conflictos devastadores. El autor subraya que la polarización no es un fenómeno nuevo ni exclusivo de la era digital, sino una constante de la naturaleza humana que se ha adaptado a distintos contextos. En la actualidad, señala que la crispación política ha adoptado nuevas formas, donde los partidos premian la lealtad sobre la experiencia y los ciudadanos participan en disputas simbólicas a través de redes sociales y medios de comunicación. Como metáfora de serenidad en medio de este caos, el artículo utiliza a Jordi Hurtado, presentador de televisión, cuya constancia y neutralidad contrastan con la volatilidad del debate público.

Este ritual, que se practica principalmente en Bombay por la comunidad parsi, se basa en creencias religiosas que consideran sagrados los elementos naturales y ven la excarnación como un acto de caridad y respeto ecológico. La torre tiene tres anillos diferenciados según género y edad donde se colocan los cadáveres, los cuales son descompuestos por aves carroñeras y luego los huesos se depositan en un pozo central para su desintegración final, con un sistema para purificar el agua filtrada. En Irán, la práctica está prohibida desde los años 70 por motivos sanitarios, y las torres se conservan como patrimonio histórico.

El detenido fue arrestado en agosto en un apartamento turístico cercano a Rimini, donde se encontraba de vacaciones con su familia, tras la emisión de una euroorden. Desde su arresto, permaneció en una prisión de máxima seguridad en Italia y llegó a iniciar una huelga de hambre, que abandonó doce días después. 

El Tribunal Supremo italiano confirmó la extradición la semana pasada, después de revisar por segunda vez el caso, ya que previamente había anulado una sentencia que también autorizaba su entrega.

Entre 2011 y 2021 se construyeron 959.554 nuevos pisos, pero el número de hogares no aumentó proporcionalmente, dejando 3,8 millones de viviendas vacías, un 14,4% del total, muy por encima del 5% considerado razonable. Además, la vivienda protegida ha caído de un 20% a un mínimo del 7,39% en 2024, generando un déficit crónico que limita el acceso a viviendas asequibles. El estudio concluye que la crisis inmobiliaria no se debe a la falta de pisos, sino a la escasez de vivienda pública y protegida, lo que encarece los precios en el mercado libre y retrasa la emancipación juvenil. Para revertir esta situación, los investigadores proponen reforzar la inversión pública, movilizar el parque existente mediante fórmulas urbanísticas flexibles y prior]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-senala-que-el-problema-de-la-vivienda-en-espana-es-la-gestion-y-escasez-de-vivienda-protegida-no-la-falta-de-pisos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-upc-senala-que-el-problema-de-la-vivienda-en-espana-es-la-gestion-y-escasez-de-vivienda-protegida-no-la-falta-de-pisos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 12:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gary Stevenson critica la desconexión de la izquierda con hombres jóvenes obreros]]></title><description><![CDATA[Gary Stevenson, ex-trader de Citibank que se hizo millonario apostando al colapso financiero, abandonó su carrera al ver que alimentaba la desigualdad.

Hegseth afirmó en la red social X que se trató de “golpes letales y cinéticos” y defendió que todas las operaciones en la zona cumplen la legislación estadounidense e internacional, así como el derecho de los conflictos armados.

El grupo dominante, Kahama, se dividió en facciones, desencadenando una serie de enfrentamientos estratégicos por el control territorial. Las emboscadas, asesinatos selectivos y la vigilancia de fronteras eran tácticas habituales de los chimpancés, que demostraban inteligencia y planificación en sus ataques. La investigación sugiere que el aumento del número de machos frente a hembras fue un factor clave en el inicio de la guerra. Tras casi cuatro años, el clan Kasakela emergió como vencedor, eliminando a los machos más fuertes de la facción rival y absorbiendo a los más débiles. No obstante, esta victoria tuvo un alto coste, ya que el clan sobreviviente quedó debilitado y perdió parte de su territorio frente a otros grupos vecinos.

Esta iniciativa busca competir directamente con la extensa infraestructura de Tesla, que cuenta con 88 estaciones Supercharger y más de 900 puntos de recarga en España, una de sus principales ventajas. Alberto de Aza, director general de BYD en España y Portugal, destaca las carencias actuales en carga rápida y ultrarrápida, clave para reducir la ansiedad de los conductores, con cargadores capaces de ofrecer 400 km en 5 minutos a 1.000 kW. La red arrancará en concesionarios Denza, la marca premium de BYD, y se expandirá a zonas estratégicas, aunque aún está en fase de diseño sin detalles de inversión. En ventas, BYD crece a gran velocidad: prevé superar las 25.000 matriculaciones en 2025 (frente a 5.000 en 2024), con 12.708 eléctricos puros hasta noviembre (352% más) y 19.423 turismos de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/byd-planea-instalar-200-cargadores-ultrarrapidos-en-espana-para-competir-con-tesla</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/byd-planea-instalar-200-cargadores-ultrarrapidos-en-espana-para-competir-con-tesla</guid><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 05:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La propiedad como factor decisivo en el desarrollo de la IA]]></title><description><![CDATA[El autor expresa su entusiasmo por un vídeo del canal Red Creators que visualiza ideas que ya había expuesto previamente. Destaca que la verdadera clave de la inteligencia artificial radica en su propiedad, un aspecto ignorado en la mayoría de debates. Como cualquier medio de producción, la IA servirá a los intereses de su propietario, moldeando su evolución y repercutiendo en la estructura social según quién la controle.

Subraya el elevado coste de esta tecnología, accesible solo para Estados o grandes corporaciones con respaldo financiero sólido. Menciona que las siete principales tecnológicas estadounidenses planean invertir 0,7 billones de dólares hasta 2030, lo que generará un impacto drástico en recursos como el agua y la energía. Compara la IA con un telar hidráulico del siglo XVIII: si estuviera al servicio de los trabajadores, produciría abundancia con menos esfuerzo, incrementando la riqueza y el ocio.

Stenger publicado en New Scientist, donde critica la idea de Stephen J. Gould de que ciencia y religión son ámbitos separados. Stenger sostiene que la existencia de Dios, especialmente el dios de las religiones monoteístas, genera efectos observables que violan leyes físicas, por lo que debe someterse a pruebas científicas. Experimentos como ensayos de doble ciego sobre la eficacia de la oración han fallado en mostrar beneficios, e incluso han indicado efectos negativos en algunos casos. Estudios sobre experiencias cercanas a la muerte, con mensajes ocultos en quirófanos, no han encontrado verificación de salidas extracorpóreas. La evolución biológica explica la vida sin intervención divina, las neurociencias ligan la mente al cerebro, y la moral humana tiene raíces evolutivas observadas en primates. La cosmología apunta a un multiverso, y el universo hostil contradice la idea de un diseño amistoso para humanos.

Surgió en un contexto de auge del fútbol popular en Francia, donde los trabajadores encontraban en el deporte un espacio de ocio, identidad y fraternidad frente a las élites burguesas que intentaban controlar la actividad deportiva. Cafés, cooperativas y clubes de empresa fueron fundamentales para la consolidación de esta práctica, que combinaba sociabilidad, educación y, a menudo, oportunidades laborales. La politización del fútbol llevó a que los partidos sirvieran de actos reivindicativos, mostrando solidaridad con trabajadores perseguidos y denunciando el fascismo.

Cada ratón poseía un mecanismo que permitía colorear y, aunque a veces fallaban o sus puntas se ensuciaban rápidamente, los niños desarrollaban con ellos un ritual entrañable llamado la 'ceremonia de la resurrección' para devolverles la vida mediante alcohol. En el centro del conjunto estaba el gato borrador, con una expresión amable, encargado de borrar los trazos de los ratones, aunque con resultados poco precisos que provocaban diversión y travesuras.

El despegue, realizado con un cohete Soyuz-2.1a, fue exitoso, pero durante el proceso se registraron daños graves en la rampa PU-6 del cosmódromo. En particular, la plataforma móvil 8U216, que permite inspeccionar la parte inferior del cohete y colocar los dispositivos pirotécnicos necesarios para el encendido de los motores, se desprendió y cayó al foso de la rampa. Este incidente es inédito en las rampas del Soyuz en Baikonur y otros cosmódromos, y podría implicar un retraso significativo en futuros lanzamientos. La misión, que llevó a los cosmonautas Serguéi Kud-Sverchkov, Serguéi Mikayev y al astronauta Chris Williams, se acopló con éxito al módulo Rassvet de la ISS.

Las pesquisas revelaron que los narcotraficantes intentaron introducir cocaína desde Brasil ocultándola en contenedores de café en el Puerto de Barcelona, pero la operación fue frustrada, probablemente debido a un aviso interno de alguien dentro del Puerto. La UCO descubrió que al menos un guardia civil, identificado con el alias 'Mister', cobraba 20.000 euros por facilitar el transporte de droga, aprovechando sus problemas con el juego y posibles consumos de sustancias.

Desde la llegada del primer iPhone en 2008, los precios de los smartphones de marcas líderes como Apple y Samsung han aumentado más rápido que los salarios, alcanzando en 2025 niveles que suponen entre el 57% y el 62% del salario mediano. Marcas chinas como Xiaomi han ofrecido alternativas más económicas, que apenas requieren entre el 12% y el 14% del sueldo mensual, acercando los smartphones de gama media a un público más amplio. La estrategia de las marcas de posicionarse en la gama alta y la inclusión de tecnologías avanzadas, junto con los costes de fabricación, I+D y logística, han contribuido al incremento de precios.

Según la resolución publicada en 2021, estas balizas siguen dos protocolos: el protocolo A, que envía información completa a los servidores de los fabricantes, y el protocolo B, que permite que parte de esos datos llegue posteriormente a la DGT. Los fabricantes mantienen una nube propia que procesa la información enviada por las balizas mediante tráfico UDP sobre IP, y esta nube debe estar operativa durante 12 años. El dominio utilizado para reenviar datos a la DGT, cmobility30.es, no pertenece a la DGT ni a la UTE encargada de la DGT 3.0, sino a un particular desconocido.

Según la interventora, la firma de estos documentos se realizó conforme a las normas de la universidad y no requiere una cualificación técnica específica. La acusación de intrusismo se centra en que Gómez elaboró los pliegos de prescripciones técnicas para contratar un servicio de asistencia tecnológica destinado a gestionar la plataforma de la cátedra. La defensa argumenta que Gómez actuó siguiendo instrucciones de responsables universitarios para evitar problemas presupuestarios antes de que finalizara el año natural.

En una entrevista en el programa *Hora 25*, afirmó que los datos que ofrece el Gobierno regional están “inventados” y que generan una falsa percepción del funcionamiento del servicio ferroviario. Fernández-Heredia subrayó que Renfe publica desde junio todos los datos de demoras y afecciones en su web, accesibles para cualquier ciudadano, como muestra de un compromiso con la transparencia y la fiscalización pública. El presidente de la entidad ferroviaria lamentó que la Comunidad de Madrid no haga lo mismo con los datos de otros medios de transporte de su competencia, como la EMT, Metro o los autobuses interurbanos.

La periodista preguntó sobre las políticas migratorias de Biden y cómo estas pudieron influir en la entrada del presunto atacante afgano Rahmanullah Lakanwal, quien llegó al país con el programa ‘Operation Allies Welcome’. Trump defendió su postura señalando que Lakanwal y otros afganos fueron admitidos por la Administración de Biden y reiteró que retirar a estas personas del país es complicado, aunque aseguró que su Gobierno tomará medidas.

Más tarde, el bloque fue vendido a tres compañías con sede en Barcelona. En 2023, el Ayuntamiento de València, gobernado por PP y Vox, aprobó una licencia de cambio de uso del inmueble de residencial a hotelero, a pesar de que aún quedaban cuatro viviendas habitadas. Después de insistentes reclamaciones vecinales, la licencia hotelera caducó y fue anulada, aunque el consistorio otorgó una nueva para una reforma integral del edificio.

Conesa justificó su propuesta acusando a Sánchez de pactar con 'los asesinos y herederos de ETA', de inutilidad en la gestión de la pandemia y la DANA, y de corrupción crónica.

Esta condición, alimentada por la adicción al uso constante de dispositivos móviles, afecta la salud mental y contribuye a la disminución de la capacidad crítica y al aumento del anti-intelectualismo. Además, el 'brain rot' sirve al capitalismo como una herramienta para alienar a la población, transformando a las personas en meros consumidores cuyo sentido de identidad se basa en lo que compran o consumen, reforzando así el vínculo entre identidad personal y consumo.

La Fiscalía Anticorrupción le atribuye delitos de organización criminal, cohecho, tráfico de influencias, malversación y uso de información privilegiada, solicitando hasta 24 años de cárcel. 

El primer exministro encarcelado en la democracia española fue José Barrionuevo, ministro del Interior con Felipe González, condenado en 1998 por el secuestro de Segundo Marey en el marco del caso GAL. Tras cumplir dos meses en prisión fue indultado por el Gobierno de José María Aznar.

Las imágenes muestran a los jóvenes saliendo del edificio con las manos en alto, aparentemente desarmados, antes de recibir disparos. El Ejército israelí ha reconocido el vídeo, aunque califica lo ocurrido como un 'incidente' y afirma que los individuos estaban implicados en una supuesta 'red terrorista'. Hamás ha denunciado la acción como una 'ejecución a sangre fría' y parte de una campaña de limpieza étnica, mientras que la operación ha causado al menos 25 heridos y desplazado a miles de personas en la región. El Ejército israelí señaló que la operación formaba parte de una intervención conjunta con la Policía de Fronteras y que los detalles del disparo están bajo investigación.

El PSOE se ha desmarcado del resto del grupo socialdemócrata europeo al votar a favor de la medida, alineándose con la posición del Consejo de la Unión Europea y del gobierno de España. Nueve eurodiputados socialistas apoyaron el reglamento, pese a que otros compañeros de su propia delegación votaron en contra o se abstuvieron, y uno de ellos alegó haber votado a favor por error. La propuesta del Partido Popular Europeo, respaldada también por Vox, pretendía frenar esa modificación del etiquetado para evitar sortear las sentencias del Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea, que ha dictaminado que el Sáhara no forma parte de Marruecos.

UU. a partir de 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[La analista inmobiliaria Melody Wright ha advertido que el mercado de la vivienda en Estados Unidos podría sufrir una corrección de precios más severa que la crisis de 2008. Según sus declaraciones a Newsweek, se prevé que los precios de las viviendas se reduzcan hasta en un 50 % en los próximos años, empezando a caer con fuerza el año que viene. Wright señala que esta tendencia se debe principalmente al aumento del inventario, la disminución de la demanda y el estancamiento de la accesibilidad, ya que los altos costes de las hipotecas, los impuestos y los seguros continúan excluyendo a millones de estadounidenses del mercado inmobiliario. 

Los datos recientes respaldan esta visión pesimista: más de la mitad de las viviendas del país perdieron valor durante el último año, el mayor descenso desde 2012. Aunque el crecimiento de precios se ha ralentizado, muchas propiedades siguen muy por encima de los niveles anteriores a la pandemia.

Aunque ofrece mayor libertad para viajar y dormir en plena naturaleza, la inversión inicial en una camperizada puede oscilar entre 35.000 y 60.000 euros. Además, los gastos anuales de mantenimiento, seguro y otros servicios específicos suman entre 1.500 y 2.500 euros. Comparando con diferentes opciones de vacaciones, se estima que con el precio de compra de una camper (40.000 euros) se podrían financiar 40 a 57 años de vacaciones mochileras en Europa, de 14 a 7 años en hoteles de lujo en Bali, y entre 32 y 14 años en alojamientos de Airbnb en España. El coste de la comida en estas opciones es similar al de viajar en camper, y mientras la camperización permite libertad de movimientos, no es la opción económica por excelencia sino un estilo de viaje diferente, que mezcla comodidad con gastos significativos tanto fijos como variables.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/comparativa-economica-entre-vacaciones-en-camper-y-otros-tipos-de-alojamientos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/comparativa-economica-entre-vacaciones-en-camper-y-otros-tipos-de-alojamientos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 13:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno multa con 350.000 euros a grandes empresas por inflar precios en el Black Friday]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Consumo de España ha multado a varias empresas por inflar precios antes de aplicar supuestos descuentos en el Black Friday de 2023.

Esta campaña ha tenido una historia peculiar en España, donde su primera edición se publicó con un retraso de varios años. Mientras que la edición original estadounidense apareció en 1991, JOC Internacional nunca la lanzó en España, lo que obligó a los aficionados a esperar hasta el año 2000 para que La Factoría la publicara en formato caja, a un precio elevado. En 2012, Chaosium, la editorial responsable del juego, organizó un mecenazgo en Kickstarter para financiar una nueva edición, que se publicó en 2014. Ahora, Edge Entertainment ha lanzado una nueva edición en castellano, que no sigue el formato original de caja, sino que está dividida en dos libros de tapa dura. Esta nueva versión ha generado interés por los cambios en las ilustraciones y el interior, así como por el alto precio de 49,99 € por libro.

La directora evita mostrar violencia explícita, enfocándose en las voces y emociones de los involucrados. La película se ha convertido en un símbolo de denuncia y es un llamado a la justicia por los crímenes de guerra perpetrados durante la invasión.

Aunque el dictador lideró una dictadura sangrienta que dejó miles de muertos, muchas personas, sobre todo jóvenes, tienen una visión distorsionada de su impacto positivo en la historia del país. La educación sobre la dictadura franquista ha sido deficiente, lo que contribuye a una falta de conciencia sobre los horrores de esa época. En la actualidad, muchos jóvenes piensan que Franco fue beneficioso para España, sin entender las consecuencias de su régimen autoritario, represivo y violento. El historiador Giles Tremlett alerta sobre esta tendencia y subraya la importancia de romper el silencio en torno a la dictadura y enseñar la verdadera historia a las nuevas generaciones.

La junta militar que gobierna desde los golpes de Estado de 2020 y 2021 no ha conseguido frenar el avance del Grupo de Apoyo al Islam y a los Musulmanes (JNIM), vinculado a Al Qaeda, que ha impuesto un bloqueo económico sobre la capital, Bamako. Este grupo ataca convoyes de combustible y paraliza el suministro energético, lo que ha provocado colas kilométricas, cierre de escuelas y escasez de alimentos y medicinas. La situación ha generado un clima de asfixia social y política que amenaza la estabilidad del país y de toda la región del Sahel.

Hao, quien fue la primera periodista en visitar las oficinas de la empresa en 2019, ha señalado que, a pesar del discurso idealista sobre el futuro de la IA, este no es un negocio viable. Según Hao, las grandes promesas de OpenAI, como curar enfermedades o salvar al mundo, se ven opacadas por la realidad económica de la empresa, que lucha por encontrar formas sostenibles de generar ingresos. A pesar de las enormes inversiones en IA, Hao advierte que las empresas tecnológicas como OpenAI están perdiendo dinero y no tienen un modelo de negocio sólido.

Este producto entra a granel con controles más laxos que los exigidos a los productores europeos, lo que genera un 'agujero negro' en la trazabilidad y hace que su origen tunecino rara vez aparezca en las etiquetas de los supermercados. Según COAG, este 'aceite fantasma' se mezcla posiblemente con aceite comunitario, se reexporta o comercializa sin declarar su procedencia real, distorsionando la competencia y presionando a la baja los precios del aceite español.[attached_file:1][web:2]

La resolución fue adoptada con 169 votos a favor, 3 en contra y 4 abstenciones. Los países que votaron en contra fueron Argentina, Israel y Estados Unidos, mientras que Burundi, Nicaragua, Papúa Nueva Guinea y Rusia se abstuvieron. En su explicación, Estados Unidos justificó su voto negativo argumentando que muchas resoluciones de este tipo se repiten año tras año, resultando en un gasto ineficaz de recursos y esfuerzos de la ONU sin generar un impacto significativo. También señalaron que las resoluciones deberían ser más concisas, prácticas y orientadas al futuro para contribuir mejor al mantenimiento de la paz y la seguridad internacional.

Según la denuncia, Arrieta empleó un tono jocoso, pero los Comuns consideran que esta conducta evidencia que existía ya una mayoría formada y un cambio de ponencia, revelando así deliberaciones internas del tribunal.

Las áreas centrales y litorales, especialmente aquellas con sobreexplotación agrícola y fuerte desarrollo turístico, sufren un mayor deterioro. Entre los factores humanos que impulsan esta situación destacan el uso intensivo del agua, la acumulación de residuos agrícolas y una gestión hídrica inadecuada en algunas comarcas.

El estudio, publicado en la revista Science Advances, demuestra que un conjunto de conexiones que va desde el núcleo accumbens hasta el hipotálamo, y de éste a la habénula lateral, puede provocar que los ratones realicen acciones repetitivas como cavar o olfatear incluso cuando disponen de comida u otras recompensas. El núcleo accumbens forma parte del sistema de recompensa, mientras que la habénula lateral procesa experiencias negativas, lo que sugiere que la interacción entre ambas zonas puede alterar el equilibrio entre motivación y comportamiento repetitivo.

Esta campaña se produce en un contexto en el que RTVE ha experimentado un notable incremento de audiencia, especialmente en su franja matinal con programas como 'La hora de la 1' y 'Mañaneros', lo cual, según fuentes socialistas, ha provocado nerviosismo en la sede del PP en la calle Génova. Vox también ha intensificado sus ataques a la corporación pública, usando un tono aún más agresivo.

Ábalos sostiene que la Fiscalía Anticorrupción ha detectado indicios de cohecho relacionados con el pago de unas vacaciones en un chalé de Marbella por parte de la compañía aérea, y critica que no se haya investigado a quienes presuntamente pagaron los beneficios ni a la esposa del presidente, Begoña Gómez, cuya implicación en el rescate de la aerolínea considera directa.

Monte Soccer, compuesto por niñas de aproximadamente 12 años. Según ASESPAI España, los jugadores del Velarde F.C., equipo rival, habrían dirigido comentarios despectivos del tipo 'a fregar' tras vencerlas por 0-8. Este incidente ha provocado críticas hacia entrenadores, familias y educadores por no fomentar valores de respeto e igualdad de género en el deporte desde edades tempranas. ASESPAI señala que este comportamiento refleja una falta de respeto hacia el rival independientemente de su sexo y advierte de la necesidad de reforzar la educación deportiva y la promoción de la igualdad en el fútbol infantil. Además, el suceso evidencia los desafíos adicionales que enfrentan los equipos femeninos en categorías infantiles, donde la ausencia de competiciones propias obliga a las niñas a competir con equipos masculinos, generando situaciones de desigua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/conducta-machista-en-un-partido-infantil-de-futbol-en-cantabria-genera-polemica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/conducta-machista-en-un-partido-infantil-de-futbol-en-cantabria-genera-polemica</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 23:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[RTVE mantiene el veto a Israel por motivos de derechos humanos en Eurovisión]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de RTVE, José Pablo López, ha comparecido ante la Comisión Mixta de Control Parlamentario de la Corporación para aclarar la posición de España respecto a la participación de Israel en el Festival de Eurovisión.

Durante su intervención, denunció la situación humanitaria en Gaza, señalando que los derechos humanos no deben tratarse como si fueran parte de una competición musical. 

Además, López subrayó que Israel ha quebrantado en varias ocasiones las normas del festival sin recibir sanciones por parte de la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER), lo que, en su opinión, demuestra una doble vara de medir.

Este hecho podría comprometer la neutralidad objetiva exigida por la Constitución española y la doctrina del Tribunal Constitucional y del Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos. La secuencia temporal sugiere que los magistrados pudieron haber tomado decisiones antes de redactar y fundamentar el fallo, lo que pone en cuestión la validez jurídica de la condena.

Durante los recitales, el público porteño mezcló entusiasmo, banderas y mensajes de protesta con su repertorio, que incluyó tanto clásicos de la Nueva Trova como canciones recientes de su álbum 'Quería saber' (2024). Silvio homenajeó a figuras políticas y culturales, desde Pepe Mujica hasta Mercedes Sosa, y abordó temas de actualidad en Cuba y América Latina, como la represión a jóvenes artistas cubanos y la lucha por los derechos humanos.

Este centro educativo fue uno de los afectados por la DANA de 2024, que dañó gravemente su sistema de climatización. La Conselleria de Educación instaló posteriormente una caldera provisional, pero no puede ponerse en marcha debido a fugas de gas detectadas durante las revisiones. Mientras tanto, ni siquiera se pueden usar calefactores eléctricos en las aulas porque la instalación no soporta la carga.

El AMPA del colegio ha denunciado esta situación y otras muchas deficiencias que persisten desde la riada, como la falta de puerta en el aula de dos años, el ascensor averiado, goteras mal reparadas y deficiencias estructurales que comprometen la seguridad.

Según Pradas, Mazón se limitó a pedir que le mantuviera informado y no reveló dónde se encontraba, aunque se sabe que pasó buena parte del día en una comida con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana. La entrevista, la primera desde la tragedia, aportará lo que la exconsellera define como “detalles exclusivos” sobre la gestión de la emergencia que acabó con 229 muertos.

Sin embargo, a día de hoy, apenas se ha incorporado un radiólogo nuevo y otro a tiempo parcial, y la unidad prometida aún no se ha implementado.

Los soldados relatan que se les ordenó ignorar el derecho internacional y emplear civiles, incluidos niños, como escudos humanos mediante un procedimiento denominado 'Protocolo Mosquito'. Este método consistía en forzar a palestinos detenidos a entrar en zonas potencialmente peligrosas, como túneles o edificios con riesgo de explosión, para proteger a las tropas israelíes. Algunos soldados, como Eli y Daniel, detallaron cómo las órdenes se daban al margen de reglas formales de enfrentamiento, basándose en la interpretación de los comandantes de cada situación.

Según el barómetro de la Asociación de Usuarios Financieros (Asufin), casi el 48% de los préstamos se destinan a comprar una segunda residencia con fines de inversión, mientras que solo el 15,9% corresponde a la compra de la primera vivienda. Este fenómeno refleja el peso del mercado inmobiliario como refugio de valor y como vía para obtener rentabilidad mediante el alquiler o la reventa. El estudio también muestra que, aunque la proporción de hipotecas para invertir ha caído desde el 56,2% al 47,7% entre febrero y noviembre de 2025, sigue liderando ampliamente las motivaciones para endeudarse.

El Tribunal Supremo condenó a García Ortiz a dos años de inhabilitación y a una multa de 7.200 euros por un delito de revelación de secretos relacionado con Alberto González Amador, pareja de Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Además, el Fiscal General deberá indemnizar a Amador con 10.000 euros por daños morales. Fesser expresó en Instagram, donde su mensaje superó los 119.000 'me gusta', su preocupación sobre la condena y cuestionó la percepción de algunos sectores políticos sobre la justicia. En su mensaje, Fesser subraya que no celebraría la injusticia contra nadie, independientemente de su ideología, destacando que la convivencia y la libertad dependen del respeto a la justicia. La actriz Ana Wagener también reaccionó al mensaje, llamando a los ciudadanos a movilizarse por l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-fesser-critica-publicamente-la-condena-del-fiscal-general-del-estado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-fesser-critica-publicamente-la-condena-del-fiscal-general-del-estado</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Martínez Arrieta, investigado por filtración de deliberaciones judiciales sobre la Fiscalía]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de la Sala Penal del Tribunal Supremo, Andrés Martínez Arrieta, ha sido acusado de vulnerar el secreto de las deliberaciones de un tribunal al revelar información sobre la sentencia del fiscal general del Estado durante un curso en el Colegio de Abogados de Madrid. El suceso ocurrió el 18 de noviembre, mientras los siete magistrados seguían deliberando sobre el juicio que había finalizado el 13 de noviembre, cuyo ponente era la magistrada Susana Polo. Martínez Arrieta anunció que debía 'poner la sentencia del fiscal general', lo que constituiría una revelación de datos reservados según el artículo 417 del Código Penal. Además, su intervención implicaba un cambio en la ponencia de la magistrada Polo, sugiriendo que la sentencia podría ser condenatoria. La situación ha generado controversia porque el curso fue organizado por una de las acusaciones populares que pedía prisión para el fiscal general. La querella contra Martínez Arrieta debería ser asumida por la Sala del 61 d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/martinez-arrieta-investigado-por-filtracion-de-deliberaciones-judiciales-sobre-la-fiscalia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/martinez-arrieta-investigado-por-filtracion-de-deliberaciones-judiciales-sobre-la-fiscalia</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 18:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reino Unido estudia un impuesto por kilómetro a coches eléctricos para equilibrar la recaudación fiscal]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno del Reino Unido planea introducir, a partir de 2028, una tasa por kilómetro para los vehículos eléctricos e híbridos con el objetivo de compensar la caída de ingresos por impuestos sobre la gasolina y el diésel. La ministra de Finanzas, Rachel Reeves, presentará esta medida en los Presupuestos de noviembre. El esquema afectará principalmente a los coches eléctricos puros y, en menor medida, a los híbridos, con un coste aproximado de 250 libras (unos 285 euros) al año para un conductor medio. La recaudación estimada podría alcanzar los 1.800 millones de libras anuales a principios de la década de 2030. 

El Tesoro británico estima que, sin reformas, los ingresos por impuestos sobre combustibles podrían reducirse entre 10.000 y 12.000 millones de libras al año, generando un desajuste fiscal considerable. Bajo el nuevo sistema, los conductores declararían anualmente su kilometraje y se ajustarían los pagos según las lecturas de la ITV. La medida se aplicaría tras una consulta ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reino-unido-estudia-un-impuesto-por-kilometro-a-coches-electricos-para-equilibrar-la-recaudacion-fiscal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reino-unido-estudia-un-impuesto-por-kilometro-a-coches-electricos-para-equilibrar-la-recaudacion-fiscal</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 17:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Modelo urbanístico en Finestrat bajo el gobierno de Pérez Llorca, candidato del PP a la Generalitat]]></title><description><![CDATA[Juan Francisco Pérez Llorca, alcalde de Finestrat desde 2015 y portavoz del PP en las Corts Valencianas, aspira a suceder a Carlos Mazón como presidente de la Generalitat, con posible apoyo de Vox. Su municipio, cerca de Benidorm, ha experimentado un fuerte crecimiento poblacional, pasando de 7.000 a casi 10.000 habitantes en una década, con un promedio de 300 licencias de obra anuales. Predominan urbanizaciones de chalets de lujo con piscina, con precios desde 300.000 hasta un millón de euros. Sin embargo, existen unas 200 viviendas diseminadas en partidas rurales sobre parcelas de 2.000 a 10.000 m², muchas originadas como casetas de campo en los años 80 y convertidas ilegalmente en residencias en suelo no urbanizable. Pérez Llorca reside en una de estas construcciones irregulares de 800 m² en la falda del Puig Campana, con piscina ampliada en 2016 y cenador de 2006, propiedad de su familia, que expertos consideran fuera de ordenación pese a sus argumentos sobre una ley anterior y cal]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/modelo-urbanistico-en-finestrat-bajo-el-gobierno-de-perez-llorca-candidato-del-pp-a-la-generalitat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/modelo-urbanistico-en-finestrat-bajo-el-gobierno-de-perez-llorca-candidato-del-pp-a-la-generalitat</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 17:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El presupuesto de Starmer apunta a estabilizar la economía en un Reino Unido en crisis política y social]]></title><description><![CDATA[Keir Starmer, poco más de un año después de ganar las elecciones con mayoría absoluta en 2024, enfrenta una crisis política marcada por un presupuesto que refleja medidas fiscales elevadas, entre ellas una subida de impuestos de unos 26.000 millones de libras, la mayor desde la posguerra. Aunque mantiene la disciplina fiscal para no aumentar la deuda pública, el Gobierno no consigue apagar la crisis política ni reforzar el liderazgo del primer ministro. El plan fiscal, que grava principalmente a rentas medias y altas, busca enviar un mensaje de responsabilidad a inversores y Bruselas, pero la percepción pública es negativa, con servicios públicos colapsados y dificultades diarias para la ciudadanía. Las medidas sociales anunciadas son insuficientes para cambiar la experiencia de la población, y la falta de una visión clara de crecimiento económico aumenta la inestabilidad política. El auge del populismo de derecha radical liderado por Nigel Farage añade presión al Gobierno, que también]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-presupuesto-de-starmer-apunta-a-estabilizar-la-economia-en-un-reino-unido-en-crisis-politica-y-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-presupuesto-de-starmer-apunta-a-estabilizar-la-economia-en-un-reino-unido-en-crisis-politica-y-social</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 16:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
