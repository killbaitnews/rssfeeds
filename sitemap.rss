The platform uses AI to detect clickbait and generate concise, politically neutral summaries of news articles, though it struggles with videos, opinion pieces, and detecting misinformation. The project emphasizes community participation: users can vote to correct the AI's initial classification, ensuring collective judgment prevails. Over its first year, KillBait received mixed feedback, ranging from positive engagement to legal threats. Some incidents involved literary magazines and sports websites disputing AI-generated summaries, which KillBait addressed by removing content and banning offending domains, often driving traffic back to the original sources. The platform also faced criticism from the translator community regarding AI biases, though KillBait clarified it does not claim AI ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflections-on-killbait-s-first-year-ai-clickbait-and-community-feedback</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflections-on-killbait-s-first-year-ai-clickbait-and-community-feedback</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 03:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[European Commission Targets Addictive Social Media Design Under Digital Services Act]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Commission has taken a significant step in its enforcement of the Digital Services Act (DSA) by targeting what it considers addictive design features on social media platforms, starting with TikTok. In preliminary findings, Brussels declared that elements such as infinite scrolling, certain recommender systems, and the absence of strict screen time breaks may pose risks to users’ mental health, particularly for children. The Commission has asked TikTok to modify key aspects of its platform, marking the first time an EU regulator has formally treated addictive design as an enforceable systemic risk under the DSA.

If TikTok fails to address the Commission’s concerns, it could face fines of up to 6 percent of its annual global revenue. The company has rejected the findings as inaccurate and has indicated it will challenge them through all available legal avenues. The case is considered groundbreaking because it attempts to set a legal standard for how platform design may con]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-commission-targets-addictive-social-media-design-under-digital-services-act</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/european-commission-targets-addictive-social-media-design-under-digital-services-act</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 02:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Strategic Responses of Russia and China to U.S. Operations in Latin America]]></title><description><![CDATA[In spring 2026, the U.S. launched a major military operation in Venezuela, including the capture of President Nicolás Maduro, under the stated aim of defending democracy and countering the influence of rival powers. The article explores why Russia and China have not responded with equivalent military action. From Moscow and Beijing's perspective, direct military confrontation in America's traditional sphere of influence carries prohibitive costs and limited benefits. Instead, they pursue a strategic approach of indirect pressure, focusing on areas where the U.S. is more vulnerable, such as Ukraine for Russia and the Indo-Pacific for China. Both countries also coordinate to avoid uncontrolled escalation. The strategy includes building alternatives to the U.S.-dominated global economic system, deepening bilateral cooperation in energy and finance, and developing long-term economic resilience against sanctions.

The men, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis and Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna, had been charged with forcibly assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers following a confrontation that ended with Sosa-Celis suffering a gunshot wound to the leg.

Initially, the Department of Homeland Security described a chaotic scene involving a car chase, a physical struggle, and multiple attackers wielding objects such as a snow shovel and broom handle. An officer reportedly fired in self-defense, claiming he feared for his life. However, as court documents evolved, aspects of the narrative shifted, including the number of alleged assailants and who had fled in the vehicle.

ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons later acknowledged that ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-judge-dismisses-minneapolis-ice-assault-case-after-video-contradicts-officers-testimony</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/federal-judge-dismisses-minneapolis-ice-assault-case-after-video-contradicts-officers-testimony</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 00:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rising Tensions Between Niger and France Amid Military and Economic Disputes]]></title><description><![CDATA[A senior Nigerien military official, General Amadou Ibro, stated during a large public rally in Niamey that Niger is preparing for a potential conflict with France. Speaking before a crowd in a stadium, Ibro declared that although the country had not previously been at war, it was now moving toward confrontation with France. The audience responded with applause and anti-French chants, and footage of the speech quickly spread on social media.

French military officials dismissed the remarks as part of an 'information war.' Colonel Guillaume Vernet, spokesperson for the French armed forces, emphasized that French troops had already withdrawn from Niger at the end of 2023, concluding their involvement in Operation Barkhane, which targeted jihadist groups in the Sahel region.

Relations between Niger and France have deteriorated significantly since the July 2023 military coup that ousted President Mohamed Bazoum.

Files for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, Citing Tariffs and Financial Pressures]]></title><description><![CDATA[Electric Bicycle Co. (EBC), a California-based assembler of custom electric bicycles, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation, reporting $6.1 million in liabilities and $953,000 in assets. Founder Sean Lupton-Smith attributed the company’s financial collapse largely to rising U.S. tariffs on imported components. According to Lupton-Smith, tariffs on key parts increased from 25% to as high as 55%, significantly raising production costs. He also pointed to financing charges and competitive pressures from companies allegedly bypassing tariffs through third countries or under-invoicing products.

Founded about 14 years ago, EBC focused on producing customizable e-bikes with as much U.S.-made content as possible in an effort to reduce exposure to import duties. At its Newport Beach facility, employees painted frames and components to order, assembled battery packs, built wheels, and completed final assembly. Despite these efforts, Lupton-Smith acknowledged that a portion of component]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/electric-bicycle-co-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy-citing-tariffs-and-financial-pressures</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/electric-bicycle-co-files-for-chapter-7-bankruptcy-citing-tariffs-and-financial-pressures</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 23:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Complete Guide to Delta Sky Club Access Rules, Credit Cards, and Membership Options in 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Delta Sky Club access rules have changed significantly in recent years, largely in response to overcrowding. The article explains that, in all cases, travelers must be flying Delta or a Delta partner airline on the same day to enter a Sky Club. Basic Economy passengers are generally excluded from access, regardless of status or credit card benefits.

Several premium credit cards provide entry, though with new restrictions. American Express Platinum cardholders receive 10 Sky Club visit days per year unless they spend $75,000 annually on the card, which unlocks unlimited visits. Eligible versions include the personal Platinum, Business Platinum, Schwab Platinum, and Morgan Stanley Platinum cards. Delta SkyMiles Reserve cardholders receive 15 visit days per year under similar spending requirements.

Travelers can also purchase a Sky Club membership, but only Delta Medallion elite members are eligible to buy one.

The mission restored a U.S. crew presence aboard the International Space Station (ISS) after the early return of Crew-11 due to a medical issue left only three Soyuz MS-28 cosmonauts on board. The Crew Dragon capsule Freedom (C212), flying for the fifth time, carried four astronauts: NASA commander Jessica Meir, NASA pilot Jack Hathaway, ESA mission specialist Sophie Adenot of France, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

The first stage booster, B1101, completed its second flight and landed at the newly inaugurated Landing Zone 40 (LZ-40), expanding SpaceX’s recovery infrastructure at Cape Canaveral. Following a nominal ascent and a second-stage burn lasting over six minutes, the spacecraft entered its target orbit and docked with the Harmony module’s zenith port (PMA-3/IDA-3) on February 1]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nasa-and-spacex-launch-crew-12-to-the-iss-following-early-return-of-crew-11</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nasa-and-spacex-launch-crew-12-to-the-iss-following-early-return-of-crew-11</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 18:12:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senate Democrats Introduce Bill to Prohibit Surveillance and Surge Pricing in Large Grocery Stores]]></title><description><![CDATA[Two Democratic senators, Sen. Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico and Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, have introduced the Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026, a bill aimed at banning surveillance and surge pricing practices in large grocery stores. The proposed legislation would require retailers to disclose any use of facial recognition technology and would prohibit the use of electronic shelf labels (ESLs) in major grocery outlets. Lawmakers argue that ESLs make it easier for stores to change prices remotely and potentially connect them to algorithms capable of adjusting prices dynamically based on factors such as time of day, demand, or even the identity of the shopper.

Critics of these technologies warn that they could enable personalized pricing strategies that discriminate against customers based on race, gender, income level, or location. Concerns intensified after a 2025 study found that Instacart charged customers varying prices for identical products, in some cases up to 2]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to-prohibit-surveillance-and-surge-pricing-in-large-grocery-stores</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to-prohibit-surveillance-and-surge-pricing-in-large-grocery-stores</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 17:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Department of Justice Confirms Compilation of Domestic Terrorism List]]></title><description><![CDATA[On February 15, 2026, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged, for the first time, the existence of a secret list of 'domestic terrorist organizations' during a House of Representatives hearing. When asked, Bondi confirmed that Antifa is included on the list, which is compiled under the Trump administration's National Security Presidential Memorandum 7 (NSPM-7). The list identifies certain political movements and individuals as 'domestic terrorists,' a term not formally defined in U.S. law, encompassing groups opposing traditional American values or government policies. Bondi has instructed the FBI to maintain a record of groups potentially involved in domestic terrorism, with reports initially due January 3 and updated every 30 days. Congressional inquiries about the list were met with evasion, and the FBI declined to comment on its contents or the people included.

The document, released by the Justice Department under a law requiring disclosure of investigative files related to Epstein, recounts a 2018 FBI interview with then–Police Chief Michael Reiter. According to Reiter, Trump called him in 2006 after news spread of a local investigation into Epstein. Reiter said Trump told him, “Thank goodness you’re stopping him, everyone has known he’s been doing this,” and urged investigators to focus on Maxwell, whom he described as Epstein’s “operative” and “evil.”

The report appears to conflict with Trump’s past public statements. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest in New York on federal sex trafficking charges, Trump said he had no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Epstein. In later years, Trump offered a different explanation for distancing h]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fbi-document-reveals-2006-trump-call-to-palm-beach-police-about-epstein-raising-questions-about-timeline</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fbi-document-reveals-2006-trump-call-to-palm-beach-police-about-epstein-raising-questions-about-timeline</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 12:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Guide to Paying Taxes Using Your Credit Card]]></title><description><![CDATA[Paying taxes by credit card is a strategy that many people use to increase their spending on rewards cards.

He complimented her appearance and her parents' efforts, then picked her up, kissed her on the cheek, and gave a thumbs-up to the crowd. As he leaned in for a second kiss, seemingly aiming for her lips, the girl turned her head, causing it to land on her cheek instead. The moment was presented in some coverage as an effort to connect with African American voters amid criticism of Trump's outreach to Black communities. Video of the interaction circulated widely, prompting strong negative reactions on Twitter (now X), where users expressed discomfort, questioned the parents' decision to allow it, and connected it to Trump's 'Access Hollywood' comments about kissing women without waiting and a 1992 remark abou]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-attempts-to-kiss-young-girl-onstage-at-green-bay-rally-sparks-social-media-backlash</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-attempts-to-kiss-young-girl-onstage-at-green-bay-rally-sparks-social-media-backlash</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 09:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eradicating Invasive Yellow Crazy Ants on Johnston Atoll]]></title><description><![CDATA[Johnston Atoll, a remote group of islands in the Pacific Ocean under U.S. jurisdiction, has a turbulent history marked by military use, nuclear testing, and chemical weapons storage. After decades of abandonment, the islands became a sanctuary for seabirds. However, in 2010, invasive yellow crazy ants (Anoplolepis gracilipes) appeared, threatening the fragile ecosystem by preying on bird eggs and disrupting native species. Known for their acid-spitting defense and highly collaborative colonies, these ants posed a severe ecological risk. The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service launched an extensive eradication program, employing volunteer teams called the Crazy Ant Strike Team (CAST). Over a decade, through innovative methods including insecticide-laced cat food and sugar hydrogel crystals, the teams successfully eradicated the ants by 2021, restoring the atoll's ecological balance. Proposals to use Johnston Atoll for SpaceX rocket testing were ultimately rejected to preserve the island's wild]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eradicating-invasive-yellow-crazy-ants-on-johnston-atoll</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eradicating-invasive-yellow-crazy-ants-on-johnston-atoll</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 09:51:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exploring Vintage Valentine's Day Cards from the 1940s]]></title><description><![CDATA[Valentine’s Day has always been a time to express affection, and the tradition of exchanging cards has been a charming part of this celebration for many. In this article, we take a nostalgic journey through a collection of vintage Valentine’s Day cards, most of which hail from the 1940s. These cards are characterized by their use of playful puns and endearing messages, with each one showcasing a delightful and sometimes corny sense of humor. While some of these cards might be considered a bit old-fashioned today, they still carry a warmth and sweetness that is both timeless and nostalgic. The cards were designed to bring smiles, with exaggerated expressions of affection and witty wordplay that were popular in the mid-20th century. As the author notes, 'the cornier the pun, the sweeter the sentiment.' The collection not only gives us a glimpse into the past but also highlights the charmingly simple yet heartfelt way people used to send their love.

The first case involves a large group of farmers blocking the A-52 highway near Xinzo de Limia for weeks using heavy machinery, causing significant disruption to traffic and damage to infrastructure. Despite the severity of the action, the state response was minimal, with no police intervention and apparent impunity. In contrast, four years ago, climate activists from Futuro Vegetal blocked a single lane of the M-30 highway in Madrid to protest meat industry subsidies and environmental concerns. This protest, although nonviolent and motivated by altruistic reasons, led to immediate police intervention, arrests, and charges including participation in a criminal organization and public disorder.

This limited-time offer could appeal to those with a large amount of Chase Ultimate Rewards points, especially if they're not often used for Hyatt stays or other Chase-specific rewards. However, users should be cautious when transferring to Virgin Atlantic as the airline is known for devaluations that may impact the value of points. Virgin Points can be redeemed for valuable awards, such as ANA First Class flights to Japan for as low as 72.5K points, or flights to London in economy from 6K points.

Thiel is also known for co-founding Palantir, a surveillance technology firm, and his controversial history in the tech and finance world.

Facilities such as the Everglades Detention Facility, Chicago’s Broadview ICE facility, Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Center, and the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley are described as overcrowded, unsanitary, and abusive. Reports include shackling in extreme heat, denial of medical care, beatings, punitive isolation, and mistreatment of children. Documented deaths and mistreatment, such as José Manuel Sánchez-Castro, Paraday La, Geraldo Lunas Campos, and Víctor Manuel Díaz, raise concerns over medical neglect and cover-ups.

The case has since become a symbol of racist migration policies in Belgium. Journalist and filmmaker Marta Bergman created the fiction film “L’enfant bélier” (The Ram Girl) inspired by this crime. However, the film has been criticized for depoliticizing the case, omitting political responsibility, and removing the solidarity efforts of the public, presenting instead a purely psychological narrative focused on the emotional struggle of the police officer who fired the fatal shot. In reality, the media and authorities initially misrepresented the incident, spreading false narratives that criminalized the victims and invented the legend of the “ram girl.” The prosecution falsely claimed the death could have been caused by an illness or an accidental injury, while in reality, the child died from a traumatic head injury during the police altercation.

Nick Reyes opens with a cautionary tale about booking a nonrefundable cash flight just days before departure. When his son fell ill shortly afterward, the family had to cancel. Fortunately, trip cancellation protections from a credit card are expected to cover the loss, underscoring the importance of built-in travel insurance benefits when flexibility is limited.

The blog also details ongoing issues with the Bilt 2.0 rollout. Some cardholders have reported frozen accounts shortly after approval and problems receiving a limited-time 5x promotional offer. In several cases, Bilt’s initial customer service responses were viewed as inadequate, though the company later indicated it would review certain cases individually.

Rather than choosing the rational option of taking 15,000 TrueBlue points each as their Mosaic “Perks You Pick” benefit—a combined total of 60,000 points—Reyes opted for a riskier strategy. He and his family selected 20-tile bonuses, with his wife and children gifting their tiles to him in hopes of pushing him close to Mosaic 2 status.

His motivation extended beyond immediate perks like EvenMore Space seating. He speculated about a potential future merger between JetBlue and United Airlines, wondering whether Mosaic status might someday map to United’s MileagePlus elite tiers. Although he acknowledges this is pure speculation, he believed achieving Mosaic 2 could potentially translate into more valuable United status if a merger were to occur.

The posts often use memes, AI-generated art, patriotic slogans, and cinematic language, but some contain phrases, symbols, and imagery with direct ties to neo-Nazi and white nationalist movements. Notable examples include phrases lifted from William Gayley Simpson’s antisemitic book 'Which Way Western Man?' and songs used in white nationalist circles, such as 'We’ll Have Our Home Again' by the Pine Tree Riots. Other posts mimic slogans closely associated with Hitler, like the Department of Labor’s caption “One Homeland. One People. One Heritage.” Scholars and propaganda experts note that these posts subtly normalize extremist rhetoric, appealing to emotions, simplifying ideas, and using dog whistles that are recognizable only to specific audiences.

This lighthearted comment followed recent criticisms of the government by the rapper regarding immigration policies. Cardi B also engaged directly with her audience, discussing issues related to ICE and voicing her support for immigrant rights. Her remarks, which included a bold statement warning about ICE officials, sparked both attention and controversy. Some Homeland Security officials reportedly took issue with her comments, recalling a past controversy involving Cardi's criminal history.

However, this support is now eroding, particularly among younger generations. Surveys indicate that U.S. Republicans under 50 have shifted from a predominantly positive view of Israel in 2022 to a negative majority by 2025. Young evangelicals also show a steep decline in support, with backing for Israel dropping from 69% in 2018 to 33.6% in 2021. This shift predates the recent Gaza conflict and reflects a broader generational change. Influential figures such as Tucker Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Steve Bannon have openly criticized Israeli policies. Additionally, changes in evangelical theology—from dispensationalism, which emphasized Israel as the 'promised land,' to supersessionism, which frames Christians as the new chosen people—have contributed to the decline.

Maher argued that much of the outrage from Republican commentators and supporters was exaggerated and inconsistent. He joked that conservative critics were still “butt-hurt” over the show and suggested their complaints had shifted over time. According to Maher, some initially criticized the performance for being in Spanish, while others later claimed their objections were about its sexual content and explicit lyrics.

Maher mocked former President Donald Trump’s remarks about not understanding the lyrics, comparing the experience to listening to Mick Jagger, whose words he said he also often could not understand but still enjoyed. Although Maher admitted he did not understand the Spanish-language performance either, he said that did not prevent him from appreciating the show’s energy and spectacle.

The ban, enforced under anti-terrorism laws, was deemed disproportionate and unlawful. The group, which has protested against Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems, was accused of causing financial damage to the company. Since the proscription, over 2,500 people have been detained for supporting the group, and while police will stop arrests for displaying support, the legal limbo remains for those charged under the terrorism act. Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action, hailed the ruling as a victory for freedom of expression and direct action. The government intends to appeal, with critics highlighting that the proscription was politically motivated, intended to appease pro-Israel groups.

According to a summit attendee, participants privately criticized President Donald Trump’s aggressive push to restart operations in Venezuela, citing logistical and security risks despite the US military’s recent capture of President Nicolas Maduro. Industry consultant Bob McNally highlighted Iran as a potential market with high rewards but significant risks, describing it as an opportunity for the US, the oil industry, and global stability. Meanwhile, the private discussions revealed hesitancy among oil executives about immediate reinvestment in Venezuela, due to guerrilla threats, unstable infrastructure, and possible conflicts with international partners.

Epstein, despite having no verifiable credentials, was given broad power of attorney over Wexner's fortune in 1991, allowing him to control billions in assets, including Manhattan real estate. Over the years, Epstein used Wexner’s wealth, influence, and properties, including the 9 East 71st Street mansion, to facilitate sexual abuse and trafficking of young women. Multiple women, such as Maria Farmer and Alicia Arden, reported assaults linked to Epstein, yet authorities did not act effectively at the time. Epstein also financially supported Jean-Luc Brunel’s modeling agency, which allegedly supplied underage girls to him. Even after Wexner severed ties with Epstein in 2007, Victoria's Secret continued working with Epstein-funded agencies until 2015.

Instead of sharing the report widely within the intelligence community, the complaint claims Gabbard presented it only to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and directed the NSA to provide further details exclusively to her office. The participants of the call reportedly indicated Kushner as a key contact to influence Middle East peace talks.

Seeking a creative tribute to the vibrant flowers native to their region, the duo froze freshly picked blooms inside solid blocks of ice and photographed them at dawn. The project, titled “Zero Degrees,” captures flowers suspended in time, preserving their vivid colors and delicate forms within crystal-clear ice.

The process was far from simple. Working in early morning light to achieve the desired atmosphere, Boyd and Smith faced technical challenges including unwanted air bubbles forming inside the ice and inconsistent lighting conditions.

ESTA applies to citizens from 42 countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and many European nations.

The term “incel,” originally coined in the 1990s as a gender-inclusive support label meaning “involuntary celibate,” has since evolved into a label associated with male-dominated online spaces that often promote misogynistic and extremist views. In the featured videos, content creator Kylie Brewer reveals posts from a large incel forum, describing widespread use of dehumanizing language toward women, racist rhetoric, and discussions that normalize hostility and, in some cases, violence.

The article explains that although some incel-related groups have been banned from mainstream platforms like Reddit, independent forums continue to operate.

After a brief chase, the 47-year-old captain, Zheng Nianli, was detained for refusing an onboard inspection. The vessel was seized, indicating Japan considered the infraction serious. While details on any illegal catch are not yet disclosed, the incident marks Japan's first detention of a Chinese fishing vessel in four years. The event occurs amid escalating tensions between Japan and China over Taiwan. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had suggested potential military intervention if China attacked Taiwan, prompting Chinese economic retaliations, including flight cancellations, restrictions on seafood trade, and limits on rare earth exports critical to Japanese industries.

The exchange occurred after lawmakers pressed Bondi on several issues, including redactions in the Epstein files and broader accountability within the department.

Tensions escalated when Bondi commented that she did not support a particular legislative measure aimed at combating antisemitism. Rep.

In an emotional moment, Balint referenced her personal family history, stating that her grandfather was killed in the Holocaust.

The mission launched at 03:00 UTC from the newly inaugurated LC-301 launch pad at the Wenchang Space Launch Center, using a modified version of the Long March CZ-10A rocket without a second stage. The primary objective was to validate the spacecraft’s launch escape system under maximum dynamic pressure (Max-Q), one of the most critical phases of ascent.

Approximately 65 seconds after liftoff, at Max-Q, the solid-fueled escape tower ignited its four main motors, pulling the capsule safely away from the rocket while the first stage continued its ascent. Attitude control motors reoriented the vehicle before the tower separated. The capsule then deployed pilot and main parachutes and performed a controlled splashdown off the coast of Hainan Island.

The USS Gerald R. Ford, currently operating in the Caribbean, is expected to join the USS Abraham Lincoln, which has been stationed in the region since January along with its escort ships. The deployment would mark the first time in nearly a year that two U.S. aircraft carriers operate simultaneously in the Middle East.

Former President Donald Trump had recently mentioned the possibility of additional military measures in an interview with Israeli outlet News 12, stating that either an agreement would be reached with Iran or the United States would take “very tough” action.

According to reports, the musician posted an image that seemed to depict him driving at 123 miles per hour, based on a blurred speedometer visible behind the steering wheel. The post quickly drew attention online and raised concerns among those close to him. Shortly afterward, he shared a black-and-white selfie in which he appeared to be smoking what looked like a hand-rolled cigarette or joint, adding to the unease surrounding his recent actions.

The situation comes amid a reportedly difficult period for the former couple, who share a young daughter, Saga Blade, born in March 2025. Fox and Machine Gun Kelly allegedly split after she discovered he had been messaging other women during her pregnancy. Since their breakup, they have remained connected through co-parenting responsibilities.

Rather than working directly with a single moving company, a broker connects clients with a network of licensed and vetted carriers, each authorized by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. This network allows brokers to match clients with movers who specialize in fragile items, climate-controlled transport, or custom crating, ensuring that high-value possessions receive appropriate care.

One of the key benefits highlighted is transparent pricing. Brokers provide detailed, upfront estimates that outline potential additional charges, such as fees for stairs, long carrying distances, or weekend deliveries. Because multiple carriers compete for the job, clients can compare clear quotes and avoid unexpected costs on moving day.

Speaking on a recent episode of the podcast “Inside Trump’s Head” with co-host Hugh Dougherty, executive editor of The Daily Beast, Wolff described the couple’s relationship as “remote at best.” He alleged that Melania Trump spends most of her time at Mar-a-Lago in Florida and at Trump properties in New York rather than residing full-time with the president.

Wolff, known for his critical coverage of Trump, has written four books examining Trump’s political career and personal life, including the widely discussed 2018 book “Fire and Fury.” His latest remarks come amid an ongoing legal battle with Melania Trump, who has filed a lawsuit seeking more than $1 billion in damages over claims that she had ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Her work is part of a broader artistic exploration she calls the “Gravity” project, in which she documents natural elements isolated within their native environments during moments of apparent weightlessness.

While Amazon emphasizes that participation is voluntary and secure, many users have removed or destroyed their Ring cameras in protest. Experts warn that such AI-enabled surveillance networks, while helpful for locating pets or investigating crimes, can potentially be misused by authorities for broader surveillance, including monitoring individuals' political or social activities.

Leadership changes within immigration enforcement are also mentioned, with Tom Homan replacing Greg Bovino.

Kennedy emphasized his commitment to attending meetings every day for survival, stating that addiction posed a greater threat to him than any germ. He remarked, 'I'm not scared of a germ.

Estimates range widely from 300,000 to as many as 2 million individuals, though most scholars place the figure between 500,000 and 1 million. Strikingly, 40 to 60 percent of those affected were American citizens, many of them children born in the United States.

Although the federal government supported deportation efforts, much of the initiative came from state and local authorities, often working with private organizations. Formal deportations accounted for at least 82,000 removals, primarily between 1930 and 1933, but voluntary departures—often carried out under pressure or fear—far outnumbered official expulsions. Many families left in hopes of escaping economic hardship, while others were directly targeted in raids that swept through Mexican American neighborhoods, especially in ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-mexican-repatriation-during-the-great-depression-mass-deportations-and-civil-rights-violations</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-mexican-repatriation-during-the-great-depression-mass-deportations-and-civil-rights-violations</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 18:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spain’s Prime Minister Pushes for Stricter Social Media Regulations Amid Personal Attacks]]></title><description><![CDATA[Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is spearheading legislation aimed at curbing the influence of social media platforms, motivated in part by personal experiences of online abuse.

The text links this trend to public education, which it claims promotes progressive doctrines, leading some students to react against it, similar to how earlier generations reacted against religious instruction. The author emphasizes that individuals with higher tolerance for conflict tend to resist indoctrination, contributing to the formation of politically reactive groups.

The piece further suggests that King Charles has attempted to distance the monarchy from Prince Andrew in order to protect the institution’s reputation.

This move is part of a broader strategy by Moscow to encourage citizens to adopt local platforms, particularly Max, a VK-developed application integrating administrative, e-commerce, and communication services. Unlike WhatsApp, Max does not offer end-to-end encryption, raising privacy concerns. The Russian communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, had previously issued notifications to Meta about legal violations before enforcing the ban.

The launch took place from the ELA4 pad at the Guiana Space Centre and marked the sixth flight of the Ariane 6 series, following five previous missions with the A62 configuration, which had only two boosters. The mission, designated VA267 by Arianespace and Leo LE-01 by the client Amazon, successfully deployed 32 satellites for the Amazon Leo megaconstellation, formerly known as Kuiper. This launch also used the Ariane 6's long fairing (20 meters) for the first time, allowing for larger payloads. With four P120C boosters producing 3500 kN each, the A64 can place up to 21.6 tons into low Earth orbit (LEO) and 11 tons into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), nearly doubling the payload of the A62 variant.

On September 12, 2024, when officers arrived at their shared home to arrest Khan for the rape of a 15-year-old girl, Ejaz delayed entry for over 90 seconds while speaking to him in Urdu. This gave Khan time to hide his phone, which prosecutors believe contained a video he filmed of the assault. The victim had been given MDMA-laced vodka by Khan, causing her to black out; she awoke undressed in his car with no memory of events, but he later showed her the recording—depicting him choking and slapping her—and threatened to share it or harm her if she spoke out. Khan was convicted of rape and had already pleaded guilty to perverting justice for concealing the device, which was never recovered.

Downey, a predominantly Latino and historically conservative-leaning community in Southeast Los Angeles County, has recently experienced growing activism following federal immigration sweeps in Southern California.

Carlos Aranibar, a local electrician and former public works commissioner active in Democratic politics, describes a personal political awakening after seeing a Customs and Border Protection vehicle near his neighborhood. He later joined nearly 200 residents at a Downey ICE Watch meeting, where attendees organized efforts to monitor immigration enforcement and inform neighbors of potential raids. The movement reflects broader concern among some Latino residents who feel the enforcement actions are impacting their community directly.

Video footage obtained by TMZ captured the heated exchange inside the aircraft cabin, showing Ja Rule visibly upset and repeatedly shouting, “What we doing?” while another voice, believed to be Tony Yayo, responded with expletives. A fellow passenger was seen attempting to calm Ja Rule by placing his hands on his shoulders as tensions escalated.

Following the incident, Ja Rule initially downplayed the altercation on social media, describing it as “hilarious” and claiming he confronted the two men over past comments they had made about him. He also stated that he threw a pillow at Tony Yayo during the argument. In a statement to PEOPLE, he referred to the pair as “clowns” and suggested he addressed them because of their history of speaking negatively about him.

The printouts, reportedly titled 'Jayapal Pramila Search History,' were seen in photos from a House Judiciary Committee hearing.

The Estonian agency also indicates that it expects this evaluation to remain consistent in its upcoming strategic analysis.

The article highlights that these conclusions contrast with statements made by several European leaders who have warned of a potential Russian offensive in the coming years. In particular, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is mentioned as one of the officials urging NATO to remain prepared for possible military aggression from Russia. The broader political climate in Brussels is described as increasingly focused on rearmament and the perception of Russia as an existential threat.

Notably, even payments to United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), a partner of Bilt, have been canceled or delayed. Some users report that funds were deducted from their accounts, yet the mortgage provider did not receive the payments. The cause could be technical glitches or timing delays, such as checks being mailed.

Inspired by the visual calm and mechanical rhythm of classic reel-to-reel tape machines, the instrument reinterprets that analog geometry into a contemporary electronic format. Rather than simply mimicking vintage equipment, Hultén translates the iconic dual-reel layout into three visible red, green, and blue discs positioned at the top of the device. These discs rotate via stepper motors, providing both functional and visual feedback that reinforces the connection between motion and sound.

Encased in a finely crafted wooden cabinet, RGB 2.0 resembles a piece of mid-century furniture as much as a musical instrument.

Vance emphasized that the objective of the new discussions is to reduce global nuclear risks and prevent additional countries, particularly Iran, from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Ted Lieu Questions Pam Bondi's Testimony Regarding Epstein Documents Linked to Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California publicly accused former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi of providing false testimony under oath concerning documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Lieu claims that the recently released files from the Justice Department indicate potential links between President Donald Trump and criminal activities. According to Lieu, these files contain evidence that Bondi allegedly misrepresented during her testimony, raising questions about transparency and accountability. The accusations come amid ongoing scrutiny over the handling of Epstein-related investigations and the political implications surrounding figures connected to the case.

For these offers, members can earn 70,000 bonus miles and Silver status after spending $3,000 on purchases within the first three months and completing four flight segments on United or United Express during 2026. An additional 10,000 bonus miles can be earned by adding an authorized user within the same period. While the offer wording may be confusing, the flight segment requirement only applies to achieving Silver status, not the bonus miles. This means the status is not automatically granted upon completing the minimum spend, but members have the entire year to complete the required flights. Those targeted for the offer should verify eligibility through their MileagePlus account and consider taking a screenshot of the offer in case of issues later.

Unlike many humanoid robots that appear suited for industrial or laboratory environments, Sprout is intentionally crafted to feel at home in everyday human spaces. Its soft, padded body, lightweight materials, and minimized pinch points are aimed at ensuring safer interactions, particularly around children and pets. Distinctive antenna-like eyebrows and a glowing rectangular LED face give the robot an expressive quality, while its movements—walking, kneeling, and crawling—are designed to evoke animated characters rather than machines.

Beneath its friendly exterior, Sprout incorporates advanced technology. It runs on NVIDIA Jetson processing hardware and is equipped with stereoscopic vision and directional microphones, enabling it to perceive and respond to its surroundings.

The findings, published in the journal Neurology, indicate that individuals with the highest levels of lifelong cognitive enrichment had a 38% lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 36% lower risk of MCI compared with those with the lowest levels.

The study followed 1,939 adults with an average age of 80 who did not have dementia at the outset. Participants were monitored for approximately eight years. Researchers evaluated cognitive enrichment across three life stages: early life (before age 18), midlife (around age 40), and later life (around age 80).

Trump stated that he initially applied a 30% tariff due to a perceived trade imbalance, as the U.S. was running a $42 billion deficit with Switzerland. However, he later increased the tariffs to 39% after a phone call with Swiss Federal Councilor Karin Keller-Sutter, which he described as confrontational. Trump's explanation, emphasizing personal dislike of the tone during the conversation, drew widespread criticism and ridicule online, with many commentators suggesting that his tariff policies are driven more by personal impulses than strategic planning. Last month, Trump announced that the 39% tariff would be lowered to 15% following pressure from Swiss companies, but he warned that it could rise again in the future.

Six Republicans joined nearly all Democrats in supporting the measure, while only one Democrat opposed it. The resolution seeks to terminate the national emergency Trump declared last year, which his administration used to justify imposing tariffs on Canadian imports.

Although the vote represents a symbolic challenge to Trump’s authority, undoing the tariffs would ultimately require presidential approval, which appears unlikely. Trump publicly warned Republicans against backing the resolution, threatening political consequences for those who defied him. He defended the tariffs as essential for economic and national security, arguing that Canada has long taken advantage of US trade policies.

This decision marks the end of a long-standing practice in which Gallup regularly tracked the public's opinion of the president's performance, a measure often cited by media outlets, political analysts, and academics. The company cited methodological challenges and shifting patterns in survey participation as key factors influencing the decision. In recent years, declining response rates to polls and the changing ways people consume news and engage in political discourse have made it increasingly difficult to obtain accurate and representative data. While Gallup will cease its continuous approval tracking, it will continue to conduct other types of surveys and research.

The woman, who worked for Epstein from 2005 to 2006, gave her statement under a proffer agreement shortly after Epstein’s arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

The documents detail aspects of the assistant’s employment and include allegations that she was a victim of sexual abuse by Epstein, including an incident in Paris. Her statement forms part of a broader set of investigative materials gathered by federal authorities during the Epstein case.

During the Cold War, the U.S. grew increasingly concerned about advances in Soviet surface-to-air missile systems, particularly after American U-2 spy planes were shot down in 1960 and 1962. In response, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched Project Harvey in 1974, tasking Lockheed’s Skunk Works with designing an aircraft capable of penetrating enemy airspace with minimal radar detection.

A breakthrough came when Lockheed engineer Denys Overholser studied a paper by Soviet physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev titled “Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction.” Ufimtsev had developed mathematical equations describing how electromagnetic waves scatter off flat and angular surfaces.

The author, nand2mario, is building an 80386-compatible core in SystemVerilog using original Intel microcode extracted from real 386 silicon. The post details how the 386 executes multi-bit shift and rotate instructions in a single cycle using a hybrid barrel shifter. Unlike iterative multiplication and division, the barrel shifter achieves arbitrary shifts through a two-stage design: a coarse 32x8 crossbar shifting by multiples of 4 bits, followed by a fine shifter handling 0–3 bit shifts. The 64-bit input width allows reuse of hardware for different shift and rotate operations. Microcode sequences control the shifter, with instructions like SHL, SHR, ROL, ROR, RCL, and RCR all using the same micro-operations but adjusting the 64-bit input differently. RCL and RCR rotations through the carry flag are handled with special loops, while bit test instructions (BT, BTS, BTR, BTC) leverage a rot]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-the-80386-barrel-shifter-and-its-microcode-implementation</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-the-80386-barrel-shifter-and-its-microcode-implementation</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marriott Homes & Villas Offers Up to 10,000 Bonus Bonvoy Points for Eligible Stays of Two Nights or More]]></title><description><![CDATA[Homes & Villas by Marriott has introduced a limited-time promotion for Marriott Bonvoy members, offering 2,000 bonus points per night on eligible home rental stays.

The organization estimates that if current tariff levels remain in place, the cost per household could rise to $1,300 in 2026. The report characterizes the tariffs as the largest U.S. tax increase as a percentage of GDP since 1993, suggesting they have added financial pressure for families already dealing with elevated living expenses.

The Tax Foundation reported that the federal government collected $264 billion in tariff revenue in 2025, a figure significantly lower than the trillions of dollars cited by the White House in public statements.

According to Gaza’s Civil Defence, 2,842 individuals have been classified as “evaporated” since October 2023 after search teams were unable to find bodies following air strikes, aside from blood traces or small fragments. The investigation attributes these disappearances to the use of high-temperature and thermobaric munitions, some of which are manufactured in the United States.

Through survivor testimonies, the report describes families searching hospitals, morgues, and bomb sites without success. Civil Defence officials explain that their methodology involves comparing the number of people known to be inside a building at the time of a strike with the bodies recovered afterward.

While the official King County Medical Examiner ruled the death a suicide by shotgun, an independent team of forensic scientists, including Brian Burnett, has questioned this conclusion. After examining Cobain’s autopsy and crime scene evidence, the team suggested inconsistencies with a typical suicide, such as organ damage indicative of oxygen deprivation, unusually clean hands, and a highly organized heroin kit. They also raised doubts about the mechanics of handling the heavy shotgun while allegedly incapacitated and discrepancies in the positioning of the body and gun. The alleged suicide note was partially inconsistent, with the top appearing to be written by Cobain about leaving the band, and the bottom lines showing different handwriting. The forensic report does not seek arrests but calls for transparency and a potential reexamination of the e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forensic-team-reexamines-kurt-cobain-s-death-suggesting-possible-homicide</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/forensic-team-reexamines-kurt-cobain-s-death-suggesting-possible-homicide</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 20:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kenyan mother deceived into involvement in bombing incident]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Kenyan mother became an unwitting participant in a tragic bombing plot, manipulated by others into carrying or transporting explosives without her knowledge.

Drawing on Similarweb traffic data from October through December 2025, Nieman Lab highlights a clear pattern: when immigration enforcement actions escalate in specific cities or regions, readership surges for trusted local and nonprofit news outlets that provide relevant, community-centered coverage.

The piece situates this trend within a broader context already observed among public media and local newspapers, noting similar traffic spikes in cities such as Chicago, Charlotte, and Minneapolis during periods of high-profile ICE activity.

At the time, Epstein was transitioning into a period of house arrest, while Beatrice and Eugenie were reportedly aged 20 and 19 respectively.

The emails suggest that Ferguson personally contacted Epstein to arrange the visit and lunch at his Palm Beach mansion.

The ship is believed to be monitoring U.S. Navy ship and submarine movements and transmitting relevant information to Iranian authorities.

In addition to maritime surveillance, China has allegedly taken a more assertive stance by publicly releasing geolocated photographs of U.S. military installations. One example cited is the recent publication of images of a THAAD missile defense battery at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan.

Rather than focusing on a single iconic structure, the project reimagines the entire Zhedong Canal waterfront as a connected urban landscape where architecture, ecology, and public life intersect.

The masterplan organizes gardens, promenades, plazas, and cultural buildings along a central water axis, turning the canal into the defining feature of the district. Public spaces are prioritized, encouraging gathering, reflection, and interaction along the water’s edge. A new library anchors the development, designed as a composition of interwoven columns clad in masonry tiles inspired by local jade craftsmanship. Its folded glass façade allows natural light to filter into reading rooms that open toward public plazas and canal views.

According to the author, President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent send contradictory signals by publicly endorsing a strong dollar while simultaneously pursuing policies that deliberately weaken it. This strategy has contributed to heightened volatility in global markets, rising gold prices, capital flows into perceived safe havens such as the Swiss franc, and growing unease among international investors.

The weakening of the dollar has far-reaching consequences.

The airline will be 51% Syrian-owned and 49% Saudi-owned. Another major project, SilkLink, will invest approximately $1 billion to improve Syria's telecommunications network and digital connectivity. Additionally, Saudi Arabia will invest $2 billion in modernizing Aleppo's existing airport and constructing a new one, alongside funding initiatives for seawater desalination and real estate projects in historic Syrian cities.

Hosted by Caroline Yoder, the episode breaks down the card’s benefits, potential drawbacks, and ideal use cases in a clear and practical way, aimed at listeners who are considering applying for the card.

The discussion is structured around three main scenarios. First, the hosts consider whether the card makes sense for someone planning a single upcoming Disney vacation. In this case, the analysis focuses on short-term perks such as welcome bonuses, Disney-related discounts, and any immediate savings that could offset the card’s annual fee. Next, the podcast explores the card’s long-term value for regular Disney visitors who primarily spend money on Disney parks, hotels, and merchandise.

Collaborating with designers Marc Newson and Jony Ive from LoveFrom, Ferrari focused on craftsmanship and tactile interaction rather than relying heavily on digital screens. The interior emphasizes high-quality materials, metal finishes, and real switches, creating a sense of presence and sophistication. Displays are integrated subtly, avoiding visual clutter, while controls are designed as objects that invite interaction. Notably, the shifter is a single piece of glass, developed with Corning's Fusion 5 and precision laser drilling to allow hidden illumination, reflecting the meticulous attention to detail. This approach prioritizes simplicity, elegance, and a stronger connection between driver and machine. The exterior design aligns with Ferrari's latest design language for a four-door EV, though technical specifications are still limited.

The piece in question, 'Barbara Rose', was used in the documentary directed by Brett Ratner without Greenwood's consultation. Although Greenwood does not own the copyright to the score, his legal representatives argue that the film's distributor, Universal, violated his composer agreement by allowing a third-party use of the music without approval. The documentary, which follows Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to Donald Trump’s second inauguration, has generated $13.35 million domestically, surpassing initial box office expectations despite criticism. Reviewers, including The Independent’s Nick Hilton, have described the documentary as more staged entertainment than factual portrayal.

Under the new system, all accounts will default to a “teen-appropriate” experience unless users verify that they are adults. This means unverified users will be restricted from accessing age-restricted servers and channels, speaking in Stage channels, or viewing content flagged as graphic or sensitive. Additional safety measures include warnings for friend requests from unfamiliar users and filtering direct messages from unknown contacts into a separate inbox.

Existing age-restricted servers will become inaccessible until users complete age verification, even if they were previously members.

Through April 22, 2026, eligible cardholders can earn extra Hyatt points on DoorDash purchases, with enhanced rewards for restaurant orders and a one-time discount opportunity tied to Hyatt hotel stays.

Under the promotion, World of Hyatt cardholders earn a total of 3 Hyatt points per dollar on DoorDash restaurant orders. This total is achieved by stacking the card’s standard 2 points per dollar on dining purchases with an additional 1 bonus point per dollar offered during the promotional period. For non-restaurant DoorDash orders, cardholders earn 2 points per dollar, combining the card’s usual 1 point per dollar with the same 1-point bonus.

Many cardholders reported declined transactions and subsequently frozen accounts, causing delays in earning the advertised 5x points on purchases. Verification processes for unlocking accounts required sending a photo with a government ID via email, a method considered insecure and inefficient. Additional problems arose with the 5x rewards offer, particularly for users who applied through The Points Guy (TPG) affiliate link within the first 24 hours. Some were not seeing the 5x points attached to their accounts due to miscommunication with Bilt’s AI chatbot or delays in processing, despite Bilt confirming eligibility via email in some cases.

The initiative seeks to leverage Ukraine's defense industry growth, particularly in drones battle-tested against Russian forces, to enable partners to acquire advanced, proven technologies. Production of Ukrainian drones is scheduled to commence in Germany by mid-February 2026, with Zelenskyy noting he will receive the first unit produced there on a fully operational line. Similar projects already exist in the UK, relying entirely on Ukrainian tech and expertise. With approximately 800 arms producers in Ukraine and over 4 million drones manufactured annually, the sector has become the country's largest industry by wartime financial inflows.

Released on December 8, 2025, the video uses satire to explain the rationale, implications, and controversies surrounding the policy in a way that is both accessible and informative.

According to the article, the ad stands out because it closely mirrors the government’s own messaging while stripping away political spin. It outlines official concerns such as the impact of social media on young people’s mental health, exposure to harmful content, online bullying, and data privacy risks. At the same time, the video highlights unresolved questions about how such a ban would be enforced, what role social media companies would play, and whether age-verification systems could create new privacy or surveillance issues.

Beginning with the work of French geologist Jacques de Morgan in 1892, it highlights how British capitalist William Knox D'Arcy secured exclusive oil rights from the Shah of Persia in 1901. Through complex negotiations, investments, and espionage involving figures like Sidney Reilly, D'Arcy's concession was eventually shared with Burmah Oil, forming the Anglo Persian Oil Company, now known as BP. The discovery of the Abadan oil field in 1908 and the subsequent construction of the world's largest refinery by 1912 cemented Persia's strategic significance. Winston Churchill later intervened to ensure British naval superiority by transitioning the Royal Navy from coal to fuel oil, asserting that petroleum was essential for military and economic power.

According to a joint statement issued by their representatives and reported by Variety, a piece of Greenwood’s score was used without proper consultation, which they argue constitutes a breach of the composer’s agreement.

Although Greenwood does not personally own the copyright to the Phantom Thread score, his legal team maintains that Universal, the film’s distributor, failed to consult him before authorising its use in a third-party project. As a result, Greenwood and Anderson have asked for the music to be removed from the documentary, which was directed by Brett Ratner and distributed by Amazon MGM Studios.

Drawing on groundwater data and heat stress research, the piece claims that India’s demographic advantage is rapidly becoming a liability as climate thresholds for human labor are exceeded.

Against this backdrop, India’s foreign policy is framed as a short-term asset liquidation strategy rather than a coherent civilizational project.

In the video, the women urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to stand with Epstein’s victims and called for the truth to be fully revealed, emphasizing solidarity after years of silence.

The discussion gained traction after conservative commentator Matt Walsh shared the PSA and questioned why the women had not publicly named individuals they allege were involved in Epstein’s crimes.

It argues that the PSOE, which had little presence inside Spain in the early 1970s, was effectively refounded at the 1974 Congress of Suresnes with decisive support from foreign intelligence services and European social democracy, particularly the CIA and the German Social Democratic Party.

According to the text, the rise of Felipe González as secretary general was not merely an internal party process but part of a broader strategy to prevent a revolutionary outcome after Franco’s death and to marginalize the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), which had borne the brunt of anti-Franco resistance.

Early in the morning, people gather outside distribution centers to receive essential food supplies as wages fail to cover basic living costs. Families that once managed on two incomes now struggle to pay rent and buy food, with inflation steadily eroding purchasing power. According to Capital Area Food Bank, over one-third of households in the region experienced hunger last year, including some with annual incomes of $90,000 to $120,000. Individuals like Shirleyann Desormeaux, a mother of four, and Salih Taylor, a government worker, are forced to rely on food banks despite having jobs. The rise in food insecurity is exacerbated by reduced government assistance, fewer food stamps, and cuts in subsidies for local organizations. As a result, both longtime residents and asylum seekers are increasingly seeking support from charities and church-run food distributions.

Since May, the DOJ has pursued these records from nearly every state, prompting widespread resistance. More than 20 states have refused and have been sued by the federal government, while at least 10 states—representing over 37 million registered voters—have complied, sometimes under so-called “confidential memoranda of understanding.”

According to the Brennan Center, these agreements reveal unprecedented federal ambitions to intervene directly in state-run election administration.

Her portfolio, especially visible on Dribbble, showcases a mastery of saturated colors, soft gradients, and sculptural forms that give a sense of being illuminated from within. Each piece, whether a product visualization or abstract artwork, balances boldness with precision, creating a sense of controlled vibrancy.

According to court filings, the incident occurred at the Hulu Theater during a sold-out event promoted by Top Rank. Przybyszewski, who was part of a paid security detail, was instructed to remove Lil Tjay from the venue following reports of disruptive behavior. The complaint claims that Lil Tjay spat at a Madison Square Garden employee and that a physical confrontation ensued, resulting in severe cervical and lumbar spine injuries to the officer, including disc damage at the L4–L5 level. The officer alleges that the venue's insufficient staffing and lack of proper crowd control contributed to the escalation. Only two officers were present despite recommendations for at least eight.

Once overlooked and disorganised, the freezer is now presented as a quiet yet powerful tool that supports better meal planning, reduces food waste, and helps households adapt to busy schedules. With life moving at a fast pace, thoughtful freezer design is shown to contribute to calmer routines and more efficient kitchens.

Rather than simply keeping food frozen, today’s freezers enable families to cook in bulk, store seasonal produce, and preserve leftovers with ease. The article highlights how intuitive layouts, smooth-gliding drawers, and clearly defined compartments make daily interactions simpler and less stressful. These seemingly small design improvements reduce time spent searching for food and encourage better storage habits, which ultimately lead to a more organised home environment.

Pond lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes. Strategically placed lights improve safety by highlighting pond edges and pathways, reducing the risk of accidents, and enhancing security by deterring intruders. Various lighting options are available: submersible lights offer an ethereal glow beneath the water, floating lights provide easy installation and can be solar-powered, while spotlights and uplights draw attention to specific features like waterfalls, fountains, or statues. Fibre optic lighting mimics starlight effects without electricity entering the water, and path lights illuminate walkways while contributing ambient light to the pond area. When choosing lighting, consider power sources such as low-voltage, solar, or traditional line voltage, along with color temperature, beam intensity, and durability for wet environments.

Speaking on Czech television channel TN.cz, Babiš stated that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in April 2022 were close to producing a peace agreement before they were abruptly derailed. According to him, the turning point came after a visit to Ukraine by then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom Babiš directly blamed for disrupting the negotiation process.

Babiš argued that the failure to conclude talks at that time eliminated the possibility of a rapid end to the conflict and prolonged the war. He did not provide documentary evidence for his claims but presented them as his political assessment of events during the early months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

This represents a dramatic departure from Musk’s long-standing narrative, in which Mars colonization was portrayed as an imminent and overriding priority. Instead, SpaceX will now focus its Starship program primarily on the Moon, aligning more closely with NASA’s Artemis program and U.S. geopolitical objectives in cislunar space.

According to the author, the shift is driven by practical constraints rather than visionary reassessment. SpaceX faces intense pressure to deliver an uncrewed lunar Human Landing System (HLS) mission by March 2027 in order to keep Artemis III on schedule for 2028.

According to the latest official information, he has since regained consciousness, although he remains under close medical observation.

Investigators state that surveillance cameras recorded a suspect leaving the scene wearing a long green hooded jacket and carrying a backpack.

Known as the “White Swan” due to its white exterior, the Tu-160 is presented as one of the most imposing bombers ever built, combining high speed, long range, and heavy payload capacity. Constructed from titanium, aluminum and steel alloys, and composite materials, the aircraft is capable of exceeding Mach 2 thanks to its four engines and variable-sweep wings.

According to the article, the Tu-160 can carry up to 45 tons of ordnance, including cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear warheads, making it a central component of Russia’s strategic deterrence. Its long endurance—exceeding ten hours and extendable through aerial refueling—allows it to conduct intercontinental missions. A recent patrol over the Arctic, closely monitored by NATO, is cited as an example of its continued operational relevance.

If a loss of status was caused by an unusual or unavoidable change in travel patterns—such as a job change, medical issue, or new family responsibilities—it can be worthwhile to contact the loyalty program and request an extension.

The piece highlights reporting from View from the Wing, which notes that United Airlines has, in practice, offered elite status extensions once every five years to some members who fail to requalify, provided they proactively ask. This policy is not widely advertised, and customers generally must reach out directly to inquire.

The development of a new cosmetic begins with identifying a clear objective: defining the skin concern to address, the target consumer, and the expected benefits. Ideas may arise from market trends, unmet consumer needs, scientific evidence, or innovation in new ingredients developed through basic research. Once the objective is established, scientific literature is reviewed to select ingredients and technologies that best align with the intended mechanism of action.

La imagen, sencilla en su forma pero cargada de significado, sugiere que los procesos electorales y la selección de líderes se han transformado en un espectáculo donde prima la caricatura, el ruido y la provocación por encima del rigor, la responsabilidad o el proyecto colectivo.

El Roto no señala a un país concreto ni a un partido específico, lo que dota a la viñeta de un carácter universal. La crítica apunta a una tendencia global: la banalización de la política, la conversión de los candidatos en personajes mediáticos y la complicidad de una ciudadanía que, cansada o desinformada, acaba participando de esa lógica.

Según criterios de la , la interrupción de la transmisión durante al menos doce meses es clave para considerar eliminada la enfermedad, un umbral que ya no se cumple.

El sarampión destaca por su altísima capacidad de contagio, con un número básico de reproducción muy superior al de la gripe o incluso al del SARS-CoV-2 en sus primeras fases. Esta característica hace que pequeños descensos en la cobertura vacunal, especialmente en la segunda dosis, generen brotes localizados.

A lo largo del texto se contextualiza el surgimiento del cómic underground en las décadas de 1960 y 1970, vinculado a los movimientos contraculturales, la oposición a la guerra de Vietnam y la crítica a los valores dominantes de la sociedad norteamericana. En este marco, Shelton destaca por crear personajes y relatos que cuestionan de forma directa el consumismo, la moral conservadora, el poder político y los modelos de vida impuestos.

El trabajo pone el foco en cómo el cómic underground se convierte en un medio alternativo de expresión, alejado de los circuitos comerciales tradicionales y de la censura, permitiendo una comunicación más libre y provocadora. En el caso de Shelton, sus historietas no solo buscan entretener, sino también generar reflexión crítica a través del humor, la sátira y l]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-del-comic-underground-de-gilbert-shelton-en-la-critica-social-contemporanea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-del-comic-underground-de-gilbert-shelton-en-la-critica-social-contemporanea</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 23:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel plantea condiciones estrictas a Irán para un acuerdo nuclear y regional]]></title><description><![CDATA[El primer ministro israelí, Benjamín Netanyahu, ha detallado este domingo las condiciones que Israel considera imprescindibles para un acuerdo entre Estados Unidos e Irán. Entre ellas, la reducción del alcance de los misiles balísticos iraníes a 300 kilómetros, la salida de todo el material de enriquecimiento de uranio del país, el desmantelamiento de la infraestructura nuclear y el cese del apoyo a grupos considerados terroristas, como Hizbulá, los rebeldes hutíes y milicias palestinas. Netanyahu subrayó la importancia de inspecciones rigurosas y sorpresivas por parte de la Agencia Internacional de la Energía Atómica para asegurar el cumplimiento del acuerdo. Además, el primer ministro abordó la situación en Gaza, indicando que Hamás debe entregar sus armas ligeras, ya que, según él, el grupo prácticamente no posee armas pesadas.

La propuesta plantea vetar estas prendas, que cubren total o parcialmente el rostro, tanto en espacios públicos como en determinados ámbitos privados con proyección pública, aunque excluye expresamente el hiyab.

Vox justifica la iniciativa en la defensa de la dignidad de las mujeres y la seguridad ciudadana, argumentando que el uso del velo integral es incompatible con los valores democráticos y puede generar riesgos en el espacio público. El texto prevé sanciones administrativas de hasta 600 euros por llevar burka o niqab, con multas que podrían alcanzar los 30.000 euros en caso de reincidencia. Además, contempla penas de prisión para quienes impongan su uso mediante coacción, con castigos más severos si la víctima es menor o se encuentra en si]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pp-y-vox-respaldan-debatir-en-el-congreso-la-prohibicion-del-burka-y-el-niqab-en-espacios-publicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pp-y-vox-respaldan-debatir-en-el-congreso-la-prohibicion-del-burka-y-el-niqab-en-espacios-publicos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 23:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Debate político y moral tras una colecta solidaria de un militante libertario con discapacidad]]></title><description><![CDATA[El caso de Matías Garate, un joven argentino con síndrome de Moebius y militante activo de La Libertad Avanza, desató una fuerte polémica en redes sociales tras solicitar ayuda económica para adquirir una prótesis de pierna. Garate inició una colecta pública con el objetivo de reunir más de 22 millones de pesos, necesarios para afrontar el coste de una nueva prótesis luego de sufrir una fisura de cadera por una caída. Según explicó, recurrió a la financiación ciudadana ante las demoras en los mecanismos formales de cobertura sanitaria.

Sin embargo, la reacción en redes no tardó en llegar y estuvo marcada por la confrontación política. Numerosos usuarios rescataron publicaciones anteriores del propio Garate en las que defendía los recortes en políticas públicas de discapacidad y criticaba la intervención del Estado en materia de salud.

La magistrada del juzgado 1 de Ripoll decidió dejar en libertad al imán sin fianza, con la condición de que no se acerque a menos de 150 metros de la víctima ni se comunique con ella mientras continúa la investigación. No se le ha retirado el pasaporte ni se le ha prohibido salir del país, aunque debe informar de cualquier cambio de domicilio. La alcaldesa Silvia Orriols expresó su malestar por no haber sido informada oficialmente, criticando que la noticia llegara a través de un particular y no del Departamento de Interior, y lamenta que no se haya dado cobertura mediática.

Reclama control absoluto sobre los pactos autonómicos, pese a precedentes donde barones regionales, como Isabel Díaz Ayuso, han marcado la agenda sin consultar a la dirección nacional. Además, su propuesta de convocar elecciones si no se aprueban los Presupuestos no se cumple en comunidades como Cantabria, lo que debilita su mensaje sobre coherencia democrática.

Más allá del salario, señala una combinación de factores que están deteriorando la calidad educativa y la salud laboral de los docentes: exceso de horas no remuneradas, falta de recursos, aumento de conflictos en las aulas y una bajada notable del nivel académico del alumnado.

Álamo explica que gran parte del trabajo docente se realiza fuera del horario oficial: corrección de exámenes, preparación de clases, reuniones con familias y atención individualizada a alumnos con dificultades académicas o emocionales. Estas tareas, imprescindibles para el funcionamiento del sistema, no están reconocidas ni compensadas adecuadamente. A ello se suma que Cataluña es una de las comunidades donde el profesorado cobra menos por el mismo trabajo, lo que incrementa la sensación de agravio.

Ocho años después, esa reflexión sigue siendo relevante en un contexto marcado por una elevada volatilidad, crisis empresariales en el sector cripto y un aumento notable de la presión regulatoria a nivel global. El inversor no criticaba la tecnología blockchain en sí, sino el carácter especulativo de muchos criptoactivos y su falta de generación de valor económico tangible.

Buffett defendía que un activo debe producir flujos de caja reales y sostenibles, algo que, a su juicio, no ocurre con la mayoría de criptomonedas, cuyo precio depende en gran medida de la expectativa de que alguien pague más en el futuro. Desde entonces, el mercado ha vivido fuertes subidas, desplomes abruptos, quiebras de plataformas relevantes y episodios de pérdida de confianza que han reforzado parte de su escepticismo.

Recalca que España acoge a quienes aporten y cumplan las normas, criticando la política migratoria actual que, según él, confunde humanidad con oportunismo. Además, Feijóo sitúa la vivienda y el apoyo a los jóvenes como prioridades.

La intención era claramente satírica, pero los presentadores televisivos y algunos espectadores tomaron la frase como literal, celebrándola entre risas, lo que generó polémica y confusión.

Según Trump, Canadá se había negado de forma “ilegal” a certificar los modelos G500, G600, G700 y G800 de Gulfstream, y advirtió incluso de la posible imposición de un arancel del 50% a cualquier aeronave canadiense vendida en Estados Unidos si la situación no se resolvía de inmediato.

Aunque muchos de estos coches cumplen los requisitos medioambientales —incluidos modelos eléctricos de cero emisiones—, el sistema municipal no permite verificar automáticamente sus matrículas al no estar integradas en la base de datos de la DGT.

El problema surge porque los vehículos con matrícula extranjera no pueden registrarse fácilmente en el sistema que autoriza el acceso a la ZBE. La normativa local prevé permisos principalmente para residentes o propietarios con vínculos estables en la ciudad, dejando fuera a turistas ocasionales. Como consecuencia, conductores que circulan con vehículos plenamente aptos han recibido sanciones de hasta 200 euros por acceder a zonas restringidas.

Su relevancia se incrementa por su temprana datación: fueron realizados en la década del 140 d.C., durante la reocupación del sur de Escocia bajo el emperador Antonino Pío, mientras que la mayoría de restos relacionados con el culto a Mitra en Britania corresponden al siglo III. Ambos altares proceden del mitreo más septentrional conocido del Imperio romano, un espacio subterráneo, oscuro y sin ventanas, concebido para recrear una cueva.

La institución ha confirmado que se encuentra en un proceso de revisión y actualización de textos explicativos en algunas de sus galerías, argumentando que las pruebas con el público indican que el uso histórico del término “Palestina” puede resultar confuso o poco significativo en determinados contextos.

Según UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), la utilización del nombre Palestina en exposiciones que abarcan periodos de miles de años, como las dedicadas al Levante antiguo y a Egipto, sería históricamente inexacta y daría una impresión falsa de continuidad histórica. El grupo sostiene que aplicar una sola denominación a realidades políticas y culturales muy distintas borra los cambios históricos ocurridos a lo largo del tiempo.

En este periodo, sus acciones han perdido más de un 18% de su valor, lo que se ha traducido en una reducción de su capitalización bursátil cercana a los 500.000 millones de dólares. Se trata de la peor racha de descensos continuados de la compañía en casi veinte años, según datos citados por Bloomberg.

El principal factor detrás de este castigo por parte del mercado es la creciente inquietud de los inversores sobre la rentabilidad de las enormes inversiones que Amazon ha anunciado en inteligencia artificial. A comienzos de febrero, la compañía comunicó que su gasto de capital para 2026 ascenderá a unos 200.000 millones de dólares, un 60% más que el año anterior y muy por encima de las previsiones de los analistas.

El Comité Olímpico Internacional consideró que el casco vulneraba la prohibición de mensajes políticos durante la competición y ofreció como alternativa un brazalete negro, opción que el atleta rechazó por considerarla insuficiente. Heraskevych defendió que su gesto no era político, sino un acto de memoria hacia compañeros del mundo del deporte asesinados durante la guerra.

El llamado ‘Casco de la Memoria’ fue utilizado durante entrenamientos oficiales en Cortina d’Ampezzo, donde el deportista llegó a marcar los mejores tiempos.

La decisión llega después de que nuevas pruebas en vídeo contradijeran de forma clara la versión ofrecida bajo juramento por varios agentes de ICE, lo que llevó a la Fiscalía a solicitar el sobreseimiento “con prejuicio”, impidiendo reabrir el caso.

Según la versión inicial del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, los hechos incluyeron una persecución en coche, un forcejeo en el suelo y un supuesto ataque con objetos como una pala o un palo de escoba, lo que habría llevado a un agente a disparar por miedo a perder la vida.

Estos ataques se producen a pesar de la supuesta tregua, con bombardeos y disparos casi diarios contra palestinos que, según Israel, se acercan a la línea amarilla, donde las tropas israelíes aún mantienen control militar sobre más de la mitad del enclave. El Ejército israelí justifica estas acciones como respuesta a supuestas violaciones del alto el fuego por parte de milicianos de Hamás.

Fue adoptado en 2011 desde el refugio Battersea Dogs and Cats Home por el entonces primer ministro David Cameron, tras detectarse un problema de roedores en la sede gubernamental.

Desde entonces, Larry ha convivido con seis primeros ministros y ha sido testigo silencioso de etapas políticas muy distintas, ganándose un estatus casi institucional. Más allá de su función simbólica como cazador, sus tareas oficiales incluyen recibir a los invitados, supervisar la seguridad y comprobar la comodidad de los muebles para dormir la siesta.

Datos del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica y del CEDEX muestran cómo ríos como el Ebro han visto drásticamente reducida la cantidad de sedimentos que transportan al delta, quedando atrapados en los embalses.

Este reto consiste en consumir al menos 10 gramos del analgésico, cantidad que supera con creces la dosis diaria recomendada de cuatro gramos y que puede provocar daños hepáticos severos, insuficiencia hepática e incluso la necesidad de un trasplante. Los síntomas observados incluyen dolor abdominal intenso, vómitos persistentes y deterioro general, que no mejoran con las medidas habituales aplicadas en casa. La mayoría de los menores no desean hablar sobre el reto, que se percibe como un juego, y comparten posteriormente su experiencia en redes sociales. La coordinadora de Urgencias de Pediatría, Silvia Oliva, insiste en la importancia de la prevención, el control del acceso a medicamentos en el hogar y la supervisión de plataformas digitales.

Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft y Apple destacan por sus elevadas apuestas en este campo, lo que ha generado incertidumbre en los mercados financieros debido a las grandes caídas de sus acciones, a pesar de los récords en ingresos. Estos gastos, que superan al PIB de países como Suecia, Israel o Singapur, se comparan con el coste histórico de la construcción de la red de autopistas interestatales de EE.UU. en la década de 1950, que ascendió a 634.000 millones de dólares. A medida que las empresas buscan dominar la IA, surgen dudas sobre si estos esfuerzos desmesurados podrán generar beneficios a corto plazo.

Esta charla, moderada por Sarah Santaolalla, abordará los retos y la necesidad de autocrítica dentro de la izquierda política en España. Rufián enfatiza que la falta de unidad ha dejado a muchos votantes huérfanos de un espacio político que los represente. Este evento marca un paso importante en el inicio de una gira con el objetivo de fortalecer la cohesión de la izquierda.

(EBC), una empresa con sede en California dedicada al ensamblaje y personalización de bicicletas eléctricas, se ha declarado en bancarrota bajo el Capítulo 7, iniciando un proceso de liquidación. La compañía, fundada hace unos 14 años por Sean Lupton-Smith, acumulaba pasivos por valor de 6,1 millones de dólares frente a unos activos que apenas alcanzaban los 953.000 dólares. Según su fundador, el principal factor que precipitó el colapso fueron los aranceles estadounidenses a componentes importados, que pasaron del 25% al 55%, encareciendo de forma insostenible la producción.

Lupton-Smith, que apoyó públicamente las políticas comerciales de Donald Trump, reconoció que esperaba que estas medidas protegieran a la industria nacional, pero terminó viéndose perjudicado por ellas.

Destaca cómo el crecimiento exponencial de las obras públicas, impulsado por la necesidad de mantener tasas de ganancia elevadas, ha llevado a una situación de 'sobremetabolismo'. Esta aceleración de la construcción y destrucción ha resultado en infraestructuras de mala calidad, una creciente degradación ambiental y un malgasto de recursos cada vez más escasos. Además, la falta de previsión ante nuevos riesgos climáticos agrava la situación, lo que obliga a una 'reconstrucción' continua en lugar de un replanteamiento estructural.

A pesar de que Herron reconoce que Lamb tiene muchas características de un antihéroe, no lo considera como tal, sino como un personaje cuyo papel es hacer sentir mal a los demás.

A partir de una conversación aparentemente ligera, el artículo se adentra en cuestiones profundas sobre el sentido de la vida, la necesidad de los límites y el valor que adquieren las cosas precisamente porque terminan.

La autora contrapone la concepción del fin como meta y como desaparición absoluta, defendiendo que sin final no existirían ni el deseo ni el sentido. Desde ahí, la reflexión se amplía hacia un diagnóstico del presente: un mundo que ha entrado en una deriva distópica, donde discursos absurdos o directamente falsos conviven con la normalización del autoritarismo, el negacionismo científico y la amenaza ecológica.

Tras ser liberado con una fianza de 3.000 dólares y un dispositivo de rastreo, Barranco ahora tiene la oportunidad de solicitar un estatus legal permanente, gracias a su condición de padre de militares estadounidenses.

Algunos menores han necesitado atención hospitalaria. La propagación se relaciona con los bajos niveles de vacunación MMR en la capital, donde más de una quinta parte de los niños no está vacunada antes de los cinco años. El sarampión es altamente contagioso, pudiendo infectar hasta 18 personas no vacunadas por cada caso. Dudu Sher-Arami, directora de salud pública de Enfield, alerta sobre el riesgo de un brote mayor en toda Londres debido a la movilidad de la población. Los síntomas incluyen inicialmente signos similares a un resfriado, seguidos de erupciones cutáneas y posibles manchas en la boca.

Así lo refleja un informe elaborado por a partir de una encuesta realizada a cerca de 900 participantes de su Plan de Empleo. Los datos muestran que el 44% de las personas encuestadas ha sufrido discriminación por edad, un fenómeno que se concentra de forma mayoritaria en los procesos de selección, donde muchos candidatos quedan descartados antes incluso de poder demostrar su experiencia o capacidades profesionales.

La brecha generacional es evidente. Mientras que el 26% de los menores de 30 años afirma haber sufrido edadismo, el porcentaje asciende hasta el 58% entre los mayores de 45 años. Este sesgo penaliza la experiencia en un contexto demográfico marcado por el envejecimiento de la población activa y por la necesidad de perfiles cualificados y estables.

Las hormigas locas amarillas, una especie invasora, comenzaron a desplazar a las aves endémicas del atolón al devorar sus huevos y atacar sus crías. Con colonias masivas y una capacidad devastadora, estas hormigas escupen ácido fórmico como defensa, convirtiéndose en una amenaza letal para la fauna local. A pesar de los esfuerzos previos por erradicar otras plagas como armas nucleares, biológicas y químicas, las hormigas fueron una de las amenazas más difíciles de contener. En respuesta, se formó el Equipo de Combate contra la Hormiga Loca (CAST), un grupo de voluntarios que se dedicó a exterminar a las hormigas a través de innovadoras técnicas de control, como el uso de insecticidas cargados en cristales azucarados. Tras años de trabajo y sacrificios, la erradicación total de las hormigas se logró en 2021, y la isla volvió a ser un santuario para las aves ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-batalla-epica-en-el-atolon-johnston-contra-las-hormigas-invasoras</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-batalla-epica-en-el-atolon-johnston-contra-las-hormigas-invasoras</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 10:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grupo de abogados franceses denuncia al ministro de Exteriores por difundir información falsa sobre experta de la ONU]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un grupo francés de abogados internacionales ha presentado una denuncia ante la Fiscalía de París contra el ministro de Exteriores, Jean-Noel Barrot, por supuestamente difundir información falsa sobre Francesca Albanese, relatora especial de la ONU sobre Palestina. La denuncia surge después de que Barrot pidiera la dimisión de Albanese basándose en una interpretación incorrecta de sus declaraciones en Doha el 7 de febrero, donde criticaba sistemas políticos y económicos que, según ella, han permitido y sostenido la guerra genocida de Israel en Gaza. Albanese nunca calificó a Israel como 'enemigo común de la humanidad'; la expresión se refería a estructuras de poder que perpetúan injusticias globales. Jurdi, la asociación que presentó la denuncia, afirma que la representación de Barrot ante la Asamblea Nacional constituyó una difusión de información falsa y podría poner en riesgo la seguridad de Albanese, al etiquetar sus palabras como discurso de odio o antisemitas.

España entregó a Francia un retrato de Velázquez, un cuadro de El Greco, un tapiz de Goya y otras piezas, a cambio de recuperar la Dama, la Inmaculada de Murillo y varios tesoros íberos y visigodos. El Gobierno de la época presentó esta operación como una devolución, pero en realidad fue una negociación estratégica para recuperar piezas valiosas que habían salido del país sin protección. Durante la década de 1940, España estableció un servicio de recuperación artística para localizar y traer de vuelta las obras desplazadas durante la Guerra Civil y años previos. La Dama permaneció 44 años en Francia, primero en el Museo del Louvre y luego en el Castillo de Montauban para protegerla de la guerra.

El autor sostiene que el supuesto giro a la derecha del expresidente socialista no es reciente ni sorprendente, sino coherente con decisiones tomadas ya durante su etapa de gobierno, como el referéndum de la OTAN, la reconversión industrial o la gestión de casos de corrupción. Torres describe a González como una figura clave del llamado gatopardismo español: cambiar muchas cosas para que, en el fondo, todo siguiera igual.

El texto contextualiza este papel dentro de una Transición en la que gran parte de las estructuras del franquismo permanecieron intactas, maquilladas bajo nuevas siglas y discursos. En ese marco, González aparece como alguien capaz de parecer de izquierdas por contraste con una derecha heredera directa del franquismo, más que por convicción transformadora real.

Según el comunicado difundido por la Presidencia china y recogido por la agencia oficial Xinhua, la decisión se enmarca en un contexto internacional que Pekín define como complejo y volátil. En este escenario, el Gobierno chino afirma querer reforzar su compromiso con la paz mundial, el desarrollo compartido y la construcción de una comunidad de futuro común para la humanidad.

Según el texto, los varones jóvenes tienden a alejarse de la izquierda y a posicionarse en la derecha como reacción a lo que identifican como políticas identitarias centradas en el sexo y percibidas como segregadoras o discriminatorias.

El autor sostiene que esta brecha es más intensa cuanto menor es la edad, porque es en los primeros años de la vida adulta cuando se consolida la conciencia política. A su juicio, muchos de estos jóvenes, una vez instalados en un ecosistema mediático y cultural de derechas, mantendrán esa orientación durante décadas, lo que tendría efectos duraderos en la sociedad española.

Sánchez obsequió a Newsom con un ejemplar en español de El Quijote, la obra más conocida de Miguel de Cervantes y uno de los grandes clásicos de la literatura universal. Al entregar el libro, el presidente español subrayó el valor simbólico de la novela y afirmó que en ella se puede encontrar inspiración para enfrentarse a los “gigantes”, una frase que muchos interpretaron como una alusión indirecta a figuras de peso del actual panorama político y económico internacional, como el expresidente estadounidense Donald Trump o grandes tecnócratas y empresarios influyentes.

La presencia del Reichsführer de las SS no fue un gesto protocolario ni turístico, sino una misión política destinada a inspeccionar los sistemas de seguridad de la dictadura, reforzar la cooperación policial entre España y la Alemania nazi y preparar la posterior entrevista entre Franco y Hitler en Hendaya. En ese contexto, la tauromaquia fue presentada por el régimen como un símbolo identitario adecuado para honrar a uno de los máximos responsables del aparato represivo nazi.

El relato presenta un mundo distópico marcado por la degradación ecológica, el autoritarismo y la desigualdad social, donde un protagonista sin nombre es condenado a trabajos forzados en un entorno exterior devastado por el sol.

La controversia surge tras las declaraciones del rector, Lluís Serra, en Vanity Fair, donde defendía el proceso seguido y aseguraba que la mayoría de la universidad apoyaba la candidatura. Los docentes cuestionan esta afirmación, señalando que la votación en el claustro del 25 de noviembre de 2025 contó con 50 votos a favor, 16 en contra y 8 abstenciones de un total de 200 claustrales, lo que según ellos no refleja el sentir de toda la comunidad universitaria.

La formación surge de la confluencia de varios grupúsculos ultras que adquirieron visibilidad durante las protestas frente a la sede del PSOE en la calle Ferraz en 2023. El partido tiene como principal impulsor a Enrique Lemus, ideólogo de ultraderecha muy activo en redes sociales, y procede directamente del colectivo Núcleo Nacional, registrado como asociación en agosto de 2024.

El local declarado como sede coincide con un espacio previamente vinculado a organizaciones de extrema derecha como Democracia Nacional. Las autoridades han abierto investigaciones judiciales contra Núcleo Nacional por posibles delitos de odio, y varios de sus miembros han sido detenidos en distintas ciudades por pintadas, acoso y difusión de mensajes racistas contra inmigrantes y personas de izqu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-nuevo-partido-de-ideologia-neonazi-se-registra-oficialmente-y-fija-su-sede-en-valladolid</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-nuevo-partido-de-ideologia-neonazi-se-registra-oficialmente-y-fija-su-sede-en-valladolid</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 23:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La cúpula del BBVA aumenta su remuneración en 2025 mientras se congela el salario medio de la plantilla]]></title><description><![CDATA[El informe de remuneraciones remitido a la por el refleja un notable incremento en los salarios de su alta dirección durante 2025, un ejercicio marcado por el fracaso de la OPA sobre Sabadell pero también por beneficios récord.

Por su parte, el consejero delegado, , ganó 8,1 millones, lo que supone un aumento del 11,1%, aunque sin plan de pensiones, al cobrar esa retribución en otros conceptos.

Ambos directivos mantienen oficialmente congelado su sueldo fijo, situado en torno a los 2-3 millones anuales, pero el grueso de su retribución procede de variables y otros incentivos. Esta situación contrasta con la evolución salarial del resto de la plantilla: la remuneración media de los trabajadores del banco se mantuvo en 48.000 euros anuales, sin subida alguna por primera vez desde 2021.

La iniciativa, denominada Stop Price Gouging in Grocery Stores Act of 2026, busca impedir que los comercios modifiquen los precios de los alimentos en tiempo real o de forma personalizada mediante algoritmos, reconocimiento facial u otros sistemas automatizados.

La propuesta obligaría a las tiendas a revelar si utilizan tecnologías de reconocimiento facial y prohibiría el uso de etiquetas electrónicas de precios en los grandes establecimientos, ya que estas permiten cambiar los precios de manera remota e instantánea. Los legisladores temen que estos sistemas puedan emplearse para cobrar importes distintos por el mismo producto en función de factores como la hora del día, el comportamiento del cliente o incluso características personales como ingresos, raza o género.

La preocupación no es solo teórica. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/propuesta-legislativa-en-ee-uu-para-prohibir-la-fijacion-dinamica-y-personalizada-de-precios-en-supermercados</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/propuesta-legislativa-en-ee-uu-para-prohibir-la-fijacion-dinamica-y-personalizada-de-precios-en-supermercados</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 23:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El F-35 y la dependencia de Europa hacia los Estados Unidos: análisis de un experto]]></title><description><![CDATA[El F-35, avión de combate de Lockheed Martin, ha generado un gran debate sobre la dependencia de Europa hacia Estados Unidos. El experto militar Joseph Henrotin explica que este avión no es solo un avión, sino un sistema integrado en redes que requiere constantes actualizaciones de software y mantenimiento a través de servidores estadounidenses. Además, las piezas del F-35, aunque fabricadas en Europa, siguen siendo propiedad de los Estados Unidos, lo que limita la autonomía de los países europeos. Henrotin también destaca que la interoperabilidad, la presencia de armas nucleares estadounidenses y la falta de inversión europea en defensa explican por qué los países optaron por este avión. Aunque algunos países como España y Canadá se han mostrado reticentes, el F-35 sigue siendo un éxito comercial, con más de 3.400 unidades previstas. Sin embargo, el experto señala que el avión presenta importantes limitaciones técnicas y de rendimiento, como la falta de maniobrabilidad y un motor que ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-f-35-y-la-dependencia-de-europa-hacia-los-estados-unidos-analisis-de-un-experto</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-f-35-y-la-dependencia-de-europa-hacia-los-estados-unidos-analisis-de-un-experto</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 22:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El coste oculto de las renovables: Cómo los servicios de ajuste afectan a la factura de la luz]]></title><description><![CDATA[En febrero de 2026, la fuerte integración de energías renovables, especialmente la fotovoltaica y la eólica, ha incrementado el precio de los 'servicios de ajuste' en el sistema eléctrico español, anulando en parte los beneficios de la caída del precio mayorista de la electricidad. Aunque el precio mayorista ha bajado, los consumidores están pagando hasta tres veces más por los ajustes necesarios para estabilizar el sistema debido a la variabilidad de la producción renovable. A pesar de que la electricidad renovable es más barata, la necesidad de ajustar la oferta y la demanda en tiempo real eleva estos costes, sumándose a otros factores como los impuestos y las primas a las renovables. Este incremento en los 'servicios de ajuste' ha elevado los costes hasta niveles superiores a los del año anterior, incluso superando los costes operativos de las plantas convencionales, como los ciclos combinados.

Según el gobierno británico, la toxina se administró mientras estaba bajo custodia en una prisión del Ártico ruso, donde cumplía una condena por su activismo político. La epibatidina, conocida por su potencia, es aproximadamente 200 veces más fuerte que la morfina y causa la muerte por insuficiencia respiratoria. A pesar de las afirmaciones del Kremlin de que Navalny murió de causas naturales, pruebas toxicológicas y testimonios familiares apuntan a un asesinato deliberado bajo supervisión estatal. Este asesinato se suma a un patrón de hostilidades contra Navalny, quien ya había sobrevivido a un intento de asesinato en 2020 con Novichok, un agente nervioso.

Nueno explica que estos métodos permiten reconstruir la verdad de manera estética y afectiva, tomando en cuenta la memoria de las víctimas y su entorno. El libro compara los genocidios de Namibia, perpetrado por Alemania en 1904 contra los pueblos herero y namaa, y el de Gaza, donde la población palestina sufre desplazamientos masivos y destrucción de infraestructuras vitales.

Tras décadas de alteraciones paisajísticas y ecológicas por la construcción de remontes, telesillas, chalets y pistas, la Comunidad de Madrid decidió recuperar la montaña a su estado natural. El proyecto, llevado a cabo de forma manual por operarios especializados y siguiendo estrictos criterios ecológicos, implicó la retirada de bloques de hormigón, pilonas y otras infraestructuras, así como la restauración de suelos y cursos de agua. Se emplearon técnicas innovadoras para regenerar la vegetación original, incluyendo la dispersión de semillas presentes en boñigas de animales y la recuperación de especies autóctonas como pinos, piornos y cambroños. Este esfuerzo pionero no solo devolvió la estética natural a Peñalara, sino que también contribuyó a la biodiversidad, restaurando hábitats de especies como la salamandra.

El proyecto planeaba estudiar a 14.000 recién nacidos distribuyéndolos en dos grupos: uno recibiría la vacuna al nacer y el otro a las seis semanas. La OMS advierte que no vacunar a la mitad de los recién nacidos podría exponerlos a un alto riesgo de infección y muerte, dado que la vacuna es segura y eficaz y ha estado disponible durante más de 14 años. Aunque Guinea-Bissau aplica actualmente la vacuna a los seis meses, la OMS recomienda que en países con alta prevalencia de hepatitis B, como Guinea-Bissau (19 % de la población), la dosis se administre dentro de las primeras 24 horas de vida.

El auge de este modelo responde a la presión por desarrollar rápidamente inteligencia artificial y otras tecnologías punteras, donde se teme que otro competidor pueda adelantarse. Sin embargo, esta cultura del trabajo ininterrumpido ha generado críticas, especialmente por sus efectos negativos sobre la salud, como el agotamiento y las enfermedades cardíacas.

El principal sospechoso, Alberto S. M., fue detenido por presunto secuestro y violación, y se le vincula también con tráfico de drogas.

A partir del caso de Rocío, una pequeña inversora que gestiona cinco pisos propios y otros tantos mediante el modelo conocido como rent to rent, se expone cómo este tipo de alquiler fragmentado se ha convertido en una fuente de rentabilidad para propietarios particulares. Rocío alquila en total 75 habitaciones con precios en torno a los 400 euros mensuales, una cifra habitual en ciudades medias y grandes como Bilbao o Zaragoza.

El texto contextualiza este fenómeno con datos oficiales: aunque alrededor del 75 % de los hogares españoles vive en viviendas en propiedad, el mercado del alquiler está dominado mayoritariamente por familias y pequeños propietarios, mientras que los grandes tenedores, aunque minoritarios, concentran parte de la oferta en las grandes capitales.

En un intento de acercarse al electorado afroamericano, el entonces candidato republicano invitó a subir al escenario a una niña afroamericana que se encontraba entre el público junto a sus padres. Trump elogió repetidamente su aspecto físico, destacando lo “guapa” que era, y felicitó a los padres por su crianza, en un tono que muchos consideraron innecesario e incómodo.

Una vez en el escenario, Trump levantó a la niña y le dio un beso en la mejilla ante el público, acompañado de gestos de aprobación. Posteriormente, cuando parecía que el momento había concluido, volvió a inclinarse hacia ella para intentar darle un segundo beso.

Se habla de ‘viajar a las ideas’, una tendencia que implica la inmersión en conceptos como el arte, la arquitectura o la historia, transformando el viaje en una especie de expedición cultural. Este enfoque no busca solo el turismo superficial, sino que convierte cada destino en una hipótesis visual, que invita a explorar las capas profundas de la historia y la cultura. Ejemplos de esta nueva visión incluyen visitas a lugares emblemáticos de la Bauhaus o el modernismo, donde cada rincón y cada detalle arquitectónico son leídos desde una perspectiva intelectual. No es solo ver algo, es entenderlo desde una perspectiva ética o sociopolítica. De esta forma, el arte y la arquitectura dejan de ser solo objetos para convertirse en portavoces de discursos comple]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cambio-en-la-forma-de-viajar-de-los-destinos-a-las-ideas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-cambio-en-la-forma-de-viajar-de-los-destinos-a-las-ideas</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 13:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EE. UU. anuncia reconocimiento formal del gobierno de Delcy Rodríguez en Venezuela]]></title><description><![CDATA[El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, confirmó que su administración reconoce formalmente al equipo liderado por Delcy Rodríguez como la autoridad oficial de Venezuela, marcando un cambio importante en la política exterior estadounidense hacia el país caribeño.

El director de Un Watch, Hillel Neuer, compartió el vídeo en redes sociales, fomentando su circulación entre seguidores pro-Israel, y finalmente alcanzó relevancia institucional. Un Watch, fundada en 1993 por Morris Abram, ha llevado a cabo ataques similares contra otros enviados especiales de la ONU como Richard Falk y Michael Lynk, todos ellos críticos con la política israelí en Palestina.

A través del lenguaje propio de la sátira gráfica, la obra denuncia cómo la atención internacional, simbolizada por las cámaras de los grandes medios, se retira mientras la violencia, las violaciones de derechos humanos y el sufrimiento de la población civil continúan sin interrupción.

La viñeta no necesita texto explicativo: su mensaje se apoya en la potencia de la imagen y en el contexto político que la rodea. El foco está en la relación directa entre visibilidad mediática y responsabilidad internacional. Cuando hay cámaras, parece existir una cierta contención, una presión externa que obliga a los actores implicados a justificar o moderar sus acciones.

El estudio revela además que los hombres son los más afectados en el ámbito religioso, mientras que en el conjunto de abusos sexuales siendo menores de edad, las mujeres son mayoría.

Diana y Luisa, ambas de origen colombiano, relatan cómo su situación administrativa irregular las ha obligado a aceptar condiciones laborales abusivas, jornadas excesivas y salarios por debajo del mínimo legal, sin derechos básicos como vacaciones, finiquito o protección frente a despidos.

Diana explica el desgaste físico y emocional sufrido como camarera de piso, con ritmos de trabajo inasumibles y una presión constante que afectó gravemente a su salud. Luisa, por su parte, describe jornadas de hasta 21 horas cuidando a una persona mayor encamada, con un fuerte impacto en su espalda y su calidad de vida.

Fundado en 1941, el Patronato carecía de infraestructuras propias y, por ello, recurrió a órdenes religiosas como las Adoratrices y las Oblatas, que aportaron edificios y personal para gestionar los centros del organismo. Según Consuelo García del Cid, estas monjas ejercían un poder autoritario sobre las jóvenes, describiéndolas como 'absolutamente nazis' y carceleras, actuando bajo la apariencia de autoridad religiosa. Los centros funcionaban como hogares, refugios y conventos al servicio del Estado, transformando a las congregaciones religiosas en piezas clave de la estructura operativa del Patronato. Esta colaboración permitió que la institución franquista impusiera un control moral y social sobre las mujeres, justificando sus medidas en nombre de Dios, aunque, según la propia García del Cid, ese Dios no estaba presente en ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rol-de-las-ordenes-religiosas-en-el-patronato-de-proteccion-a-la-mujer-durante-el-franquismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-rol-de-las-ordenes-religiosas-en-el-patronato-de-proteccion-a-la-mujer-durante-el-franquismo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 12:07:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acusaciones de que cuentas oficiales del Gobierno de EE. UU. han reutilizado símbolos y frases asociadas con movimientos neonazis]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante el último año, diversas cuentas oficiales del Gobierno de Estados Unidos, incluyendo las del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) y la Casa Blanca, han publicado en redes sociales contenidos que imitan memes, con arte generado por IA y lemas patrióticos, que en apariencia son mensajes de promoción institucional.

Entre las medidas exigidas a TikTok se incluyen la eliminación del desplazamiento infinito, la introducción de pausas obligatorias de tiempo de uso y cambios en sus sistemas de recomendación. Según la Comisión, estas funciones contribuyen a un consumo compulsivo que puede afectar a la salud mental de los usuarios.

La investigación se inició tras la denuncia presentada por un vecino de origen argelino, propietario de uno de los comercios afectados, que encontró su local cubierto de propaganda xenófoba. La denuncia fue trasladada al Servicio de Información de la Guardia Civil, encargado de investigar este tipo de delitos a través de los equipos REDO, especializados en la respuesta a los delitos de odio.

Las manifestaciones fueron duramente reprimidas, con denuncias de miles de muertos según organizaciones de derechos humanos. En este contexto, Estados Unidos introdujo de contrabando alrededor de 6.000 terminales de internet satelital Starlink en Irán, según informó The Wall Street Journal. La posesión, compra o uso de estos equipos en el país persa es un delito penado con entre seis meses y dos años de prisión, además de la incautación del terminal. El Departamento de Estado adquirió unas 7.000 unidades entre finales de 2025 y enero de 2026, y se confirma que Donald Trump estaba al tanto de las operaciones. El objetivo de estas entregas era garantizar que los iraníes pudieran acceder a Internet pese al bloqueo impuesto por el régimen.

El vídeo muestra al supuesto militar en escenas cotidianas con su familia y en desplazamientos nocturnos, hasta que, desde su coche, utiliza un ordenador portátil para enviar un mensaje en el que afirma que colaborar es su forma de luchar por su familia y su país.

Este brote coincide con la pérdida del estatus de España como país libre de sarampión, recordando la importancia de la vacunación como medida preventiva. El sarampión, enfermedad aguda y altamente contagiosa causada por un virus de la familia paramyxovirus, puede transmitirse incluso cuatro días antes de aparecer los primeros síntomas.

La sentencia de apelación reduce de siete a cuatro años de prisión las penas más elevadas para dos de los agentes, absuelve a un tercero que había sido condenado a tres años y mantiene un año de cárcel para un cuarto agente.

El núcleo de la rebaja se encuentra en la reinterpretación del delito de detención ilegal. Mientras que la Audiencia de Barcelona consideró que se trataba de la modalidad más grave, castigada con hasta tres años de prisión, el TSJC entiende que la detención fue “leve” al valorar que el joven fue conducido de forma inmediata a dependencias policiales. Este criterio transforma la pena de cárcel por este delito en una multa de 540 euros.

Desde el departamento que dirige Óscar Puente se ha calificado la dimisión como un relevo normal dentro de la estructura administrativa y se ha anunciado que ya se trabaja en la búsqueda de una persona sustituta.

Las investigaciones se basaron en imágenes de cámaras de seguridad que permitieron identificar al vehículo y al presunto autor.

Su caso forma parte de las 735 muertes por accidentes laborales registradas en 2025, una cifra inferior a la del año anterior pero todavía considerada inaceptable por sindicatos y expertos.

Los datos del Ministerio de Trabajo reflejan una reducción de la siniestralidad y del índice de incidencia, pero también evidencian focos especialmente graves, como el sector de la construcción, que concentra el mayor número de fallecimientos y ha empeorado sus cifras.

Los jabalíes infectados han sido hallados en Molins de Rei, ampliando la zona de alto riesgo que ahora incluye 14 municipios, entre ellos El Papiol. Desde el inicio del brote se contabilizan 155 casos en total, y estos nuevos focos se consideran secundarios. Según el conseller Òscar Ordeig, no hay ninguna granja afectada en los nuevos municipios y se mantiene el radio de seguridad de 20 kilómetros. Las medidas de contención incluyen la prohibición de acceso al medio natural en los municipios afectados, reforzamiento de vallados en carreteras estratégicas y aumento de capturas de jabalíes. Ordeig ha insistido en que la aparición de casos fuera de la zona cero era previsible debido a corredores naturales del sur, y ha pedido paciencia, asegurando que la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primeros-casos-de-peste-porcina-africana-detectados-fuera-de-la-zona-inicialmente-afectada-en-catalunya</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/primeros-casos-de-peste-porcina-africana-detectados-fuera-de-la-zona-inicialmente-afectada-en-catalunya</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 22:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Investigación en foros incel revela discursos de odio, misoginia y procesos de radicalización online]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia aborda una investigación divulgativa sobre el contenido que circula en foros incel, comunidades online formadas mayoritariamente por hombres que se autodefinen como incapaces de mantener relaciones afectivas o sexuales. A través de vídeos en redes sociales, creadoras como Kylie Brewer muestran desde dentro el lenguaje, las ideas y la dinámica de estos espacios, caracterizados por una fuerte misoginia, racismo y deshumanización de las mujeres. El artículo explica el origen del término “incel”, que nació en los años noventa como un espacio de apoyo mutuo, y cómo con el tiempo evolucionó hacia una subcultura marcada por el resentimiento y una ideología fatalista conocida como “blackpill”.

Según los profesionales consultados, la ley endurece las penas para hurtos reiterados, pero no aborda los problemas estructurales del sistema judicial ni penitenciario. Muchos reincidentes, con decenas de antecedentes por robos o delitos violentos, siguen quedando en libertad, lo que provoca frustración entre los cuerpos policiales. Los agentes critican también que las cárceles no cumplen su función disuasoria ni rehabilitadora, describiéndolas como una “universidad de delincuentes” donde los internos aprenden y se relacionan entre ellos antes de volver a delinquir. Pese a ello, destacan que el control sobre los reincidentes es riguroso, registrando huellas y antecedentes de manera efectiva.

La resolución del Servicio Territorial de Medio Ambiente de León permite retomar la caza siete meses después de los incendios, según informes técnicos y condiciones del territorio.

Cuentas asociadas al movimiento MAGA y comentaristas conservadores han difundido mensajes extremos, llegando a sugerir que Europa debería actuar contra él sin importar los métodos. Estas publicaciones se han centrado especialmente en la política migratoria de España, presentándola de manera descontextualizada y, en algunos casos, manipulando vídeos para dar la impresión de 'invasiones masivas' de personas africanas hacia Europa. Uno de los mensajes más virales provino del comentarista Joey Mannarino, cuyas publicaciones incluso han sido compartidas por Donald Trump.

Desde el escenario, el consultor energético Bob McNally, exasesor del presidente George W. Bush, afirmó que Irán representa el mayor potencial para la industria si se produjera un acercamiento político con Estados Unidos, llegando a calificar una guerra de cambio de régimen como beneficiosa no solo para Washington y el sector petrolero, sino incluso para la “paz mundial”.

La mayor parte termina incinerada, enterrada o dispersa en el medio ambiente. Las causas son diversas y están interconectadas: desde plantas de reciclaje poco eficientes y sistemas de recogida inadecuados, hasta la baja calidad del material reciclado y la falta de profesionalización del sector. Además, muchos plásticos de un solo uso y productos diseñados para no reciclarse complican la tarea. Exportar residuos a otros países tampoco resuelve el problema y la participación ciudadana, aunque importante, no es suficiente. En definitiva, el reciclaje de plástico no es una solución mágica, sino una herramienta dentro de un enfoque más amplio que requiere reducción del consumo, reutilización, ecodiseño y economía circular.

Gómez defiende que retrasar la edad de jubilación es la medida “más barata” para la Seguridad Social, ya que reduce el número de prestaciones pagadas y aumenta los ingresos por cotizaciones. Recuerda que ya impulsó el aumento de la edad legal de jubilación de 65 a 67 años, proceso que culmina en 2027, y advierte de que a partir de entonces podría abrirse la puerta a nuevos retrasos, aunque con diferencias según sectores, dado que no todos los trabajos permiten alargar la vida laboral en las mismas condiciones.

Aquest jo que jo soc*, una obra que recorre la trayectoria vital, artística y política del cantautor valenciano que se convirtió en una de las voces más incómodas del franquismo. A los 85 años, Raimon vive retirado, busca el silencio y rehúye la nostalgia, pero su figura sigue anclada en el imaginario colectivo como símbolo de resistencia cultural y política.

El reportaje repasa sus orígenes humildes en Xàtiva, su paso por distintos oficios y países, y la metamorfosis de Ramón Pelegero en Raimon, el artista que decidió cantar en catalán pese a la censura, las prohibiciones y la represión policial. Sus conciertos fueron vetados, sus discos vigilados y su nombre apareció en informes de la Brigada Político-Social como peligro para el régimen.

La autora considera inaceptable que varios miembros del jurado, encabezados por su presidente Wim Wenders, hayan evitado condenar explícitamente lo que ella califica como un genocidio contra el pueblo palestino y hayan defendido que el arte no debería ser político.

Roy ha explicado que su decisión llega tras escuchar declaraciones públicas del jurado en las que se eludía pronunciarse sobre Palestina, pese a que la Berlinale sí ha condenado en otras ocasiones diversas injusticias y conflictos internacionales. Para la escritora, afirmar que el arte debe mantenerse al margen de la política supone, en este contexto, una forma de silenciar un crimen de lesa humanidad que se está produciendo ante los ojos del mundo.

Wexner, fundador del imperio textil The Limited y responsable del éxito global de , concedió a Epstein en 1991 un poder notarial extraordinariamente amplio que le permitía gestionar su fortuna sin límites efectivos. Durante años, Epstein fue su asesor financiero exclusivo, pese a las advertencias explícitas de colaboradores cercanos que desconfiaban de él.

La víctima, de 38 años, logró escapar aprovechando que su captor dormía, saltó el muro de la casa y caminó varios kilómetros hasta pedir ayuda a su expareja, quien la trasladó al médico.

Según fuentes judiciales, la mujer presentaba un grave deterioro físico tras un largo periodo sin atención sanitaria: múltiples hematomas, una brecha en la cabeza, pérdida de varios dientes y la pérdida total de visión en un ojo, causada presuntamente por una paliza.

Entre las prácticas denunciadas destaca la obligación de compensar días de vacaciones trabajando en fiestas de cumpleaños organizadas por la propia academia los fines de semana.

La reciente sentencia aclara que la inscripción de la operación en el Registro de la Propiedad no sustituye la obligación de notificar directamente al inquilino, y que el plazo de retracto solo comienza cuando el arrendatario tiene conocimiento completo de la venta. El caso que motivó la resolución involucró a un fondo que compró un paquete de 19 viviendas a un banco sin informar a los arrendatarios, argumentando que la publicidad registral era suficiente.

Datos recientes muestran que Madrid y Barcelona son de las ciudades europeas más inaccesibles para quienes dependen de un salario. En promedio, una persona debe destinar el 74% de su sueldo mensual para pagar un alquiler, lo que limita gravemente la capacidad de cubrir otros gastos básicos. En la última década, los precios de la vivienda han subido un 72%, mientras que los salarios apenas lo han hecho en un 22,7%. Esto obliga a muchos jóvenes a compartir piso con varias personas, reduciendo la expectativa de independencia y vivienda en propiedad a un objetivo prácticamente inalcanzable. La edad media de emancipación en España es de 30 años, superior a la media europea de 26, debido a la disparidad entre ingresos y costes de vivienda. Con un salario medio juvenil de 1.170 euros al mes, independizarse en solitario resulta casi imposible.

Fesser subraya que de los 400.000 detenidos por el ICE, únicamente el 14% tiene antecedentes penales, desmintiendo la idea de que se están arrestando a los criminales más peligrosos del país.

Según un informe reciente del portal inmobiliario Idealista, el 68% de los alquileres disponibles exige a los hogares destinar más del 30% de sus ingresos, el umbral que los expertos consideran saludable para el gasto en vivienda. De hecho, alquilar absorbe de media el 38% de los ingresos familiares, frente al 26% que supone una hipoteca.

El esfuerzo para alquilar supera en 12 puntos al necesario para comprar una vivienda y en al menos 12 capitales de provincia el alquiler rebasa claramente ese límite recomendado. El problema se agrava por la fuerte subida de precios registrada en los últimos cinco años: según pisos.com, el alquiler ha aumentado un 46% de media en España desde 2021, con incrementos de hasta el 80% en comunidades como Madrid, Baleares o Cataluña.

La causa se centra en la difusión en redes sociales de datos concretos sobre la localización de su domicilio, hechos que la querellante considera constitutivos de delitos contra la intimidad personal y familiar, así como de hostigamiento y acoso.

Según la documentación judicial conocida, las diligencias se abrieron en mayo del año pasado, aunque la declaración se ha retrasado por dificultades para localizar a Quiles y notificarle formalmente. Finalmente, la jueza ordenó a la Policía Judicial que procediera a su localización. En la querella se solicitaban también medidas cautelares, como el bloqueo de los contenidos publicados en X y Telegram, pero estas peticiones fueron desestimadas.

El documento, que parecía titularse 'Jayapal Pramila Search History', indicaría que el Departamento de Justicia rastrea qué documentos consultan los legisladores y cuándo. Esto provocó críticas incluso dentro del Partido Republicano, con figuras como Nancy Mace calificando el seguimiento de 'espeluznante' y señalando que se están registrando todas las acciones sobre los archivos, incluyendo marcas de tiempo. Jayapal denunció la situación como 'indignante' y aseguró que buscará frenar el presunto espionaje a miembros del Congreso.

El fallo supone un duro revés para el Ejecutivo encabezado por Keir Starmer, al considerar que la prohibición constituyó una interferencia desproporcionada en los derechos a la libertad de expresión y de reunión. No obstante, la ilegalización se mantendrá de forma provisional hasta una nueva vista prevista para el 20 de febrero, en la que las partes presentarán sus alegaciones antes de una decisión definitiva.

Palestine Action fue designada como organización terrorista en julio de 2025, tras una serie de acciones directas contra empresas de armamento vinculadas a Israel y contra instalaciones militares británicas. Entre estas protestas se incluyeron bloqueos de accesos, infiltraciones en bases militares y daños materiales, como pintadas y destrozos en aviones de la Fuerza Aérea en la base de Brize Norton.

Según el reportaje, estas armas —conocidas también como bombas de vacío o aerosol— pueden generar temperaturas superiores a los 3.500 grados centígrados, suficientes para calcinar tejidos humanos hasta hacerlos irreconocibles.

A pesar de su amplia aceptación en el ámbito meteorológico, esta palabra no ha sido reconocida oficialmente por la Real Academia Española, a pesar de los esfuerzos por incorporarla. El 'engelamiento' se produce cuando gotas de agua líquida a temperaturas inferiores a 0°C impactan sobre la aeronave, congelándose al instante y formando una capa de hielo. Este fenómeno puede degradar las capacidades aerodinámicas del avión y poner en riesgo la seguridad del vuelo. La historia del término se remonta a los años 30, cuando los pioneros en meteorología aeronáutica en España propusieron la palabra para describir este fenómeno.

Kennedy Jr., secretario de salud de EE. UU., compartió en el podcast 'This Past Weekend' con Theo Von detalles sobre su historial de adicciones y su experiencia en programas de recuperación. Kennedy reveló que comenzó su camino hacia la adicción a los 15 años tras probar LSD y que también ha luchado contra la dependencia de la heroína. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, las reuniones de rehabilitación se cancelaron, pero él mantuvo encuentros diarios en grupos improvisados, enfatizando la importancia de continuar su tratamiento para sobrevivir y mantener su salud. Kennedy afirmó no tener miedo a los gérmenes porque en el pasado llegó a esnifar cocaína en condiciones insalubres, subrayando que la adicción representa un riesgo mucho mayor para su vida. Sus declaraciones llegan tras anunciarse una inversión de 100 millones de dólares en programas piloto destinados a combatir la falta de vivienda y apoyar la recuperación de personas con adicciones en ocho ciudades, iniciativa que s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rfk-jr-habla-sobre-su-adiccion-pasada-y-su-enfoque-en-la-recuperacion-durante-la-pandemia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rfk-jr-habla-sobre-su-adiccion-pasada-y-su-enfoque-en-la-recuperacion-durante-la-pandemia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 11:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diputado de Vox propone violencia extrema contra RTVE en declaraciones públicas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El diputado de Vox José María Figaredo ha vuelto a generar polémica por sus declaraciones sobre la Radio Televisión Pública Española (RTVE). Tras episodios anteriores en los que otros miembros de su partido, como José Manuel Mariscal, sugerían entrar al ente público con motosierra o lanzallamas, Figaredo ha elevado la retórica al mencionar la bomba atómica como supuesta forma de acceder a la corporación. Durante sus intervenciones, el diputado ha acusado a RTVE de manipulación mediática, desprecio hacia los españoles y de favorecer a ciertos presentadores y tertulianos mientras ignora los problemas cotidianos de la ciudadanía. Figaredo ha citado nombres concretos como Javier Ruiz, Jesús Cintora y Silvia Intxaurrondo, asegurando que se lucran y se burlan de quienes critican al Gobierno.

Solís es diplomada en Enfermería desde 2008 y ha desarrollado su carrera en el SES, incluyendo labores como enfermera quirúrgica. Su participación genera polémica porque el tribunal evaluador ha sido nombrado por su jefe directo, Jesús Vilés, director gerente del SES, lo que plantea un dilema ético sobre la transparencia del proceso. Profesionales sanitarios de la zona han expresado su malestar y cuestionan la imparcialidad.

Así lo manifestaron los consejeros delegados de ambas compañías, José Bogas y Mario Ruiz-Tagle, durante su comparecencia en la comisión de investigación abierta en el Senado.

Según Endesa, desde primera hora de la mañana ya existían señales claras de inestabilidad en la red, que fueron comunicadas al operador del sistema antes de las once. No obstante, la empresa sostiene que REE no otorgó la relevancia necesaria a esos avisos. Posteriormente se produjeron dos oscilaciones de frecuencia inesperadas, una en una planta fotovoltaica de Badajoz y otra en la interconexión con Francia.

Sin embargo, este crecimiento no se debe a un repunte de la natalidad dentro del país, sino al aumento de ciudadanos españoles nacidos en el extranjero y a la inmigración. Durante el último trimestre de 2025, la población nacida en España se redujo en casi 18.700 personas, reflejando una crisis de natalidad persistente y el avance del envejecimiento demográfico.

En contraste, el número de españoles nacidos fuera de España aumentó en más de 100.000 personas en solo tres meses, superando por primera vez la cifra de 10 millones. Este fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al principio de ius sanguinis y a los procesos de adquisición de la nacionalidad española, que explican que el crecimiento de españoles nacidos en el extranjero sea incluso superior al de residentes con nacionalidad extranjera.

Los científicos señalan que las incertidumbres en los modelos climáticos impiden predecir con precisión cuándo se alcanzarán estos puntos de inflexión, que incluyen el derretimiento de la capa de hielo de Groenlandia, la descongelación del permafrost y la pérdida de la selva amazónica. La interacción entre estos elementos puede generar bucles de retroalimentación que amplifiquen el calentamiento, como la disminución de la reflexión solar por el hielo derretido o el debilitamiento de la circulación oceánica del Atlántico, afectando ecosistemas clave.

Según las informaciones conocidas, los contratos cuestionados se firmaron en 2023 y 2024, cuando Sánchez ya desempeñaba funciones en la institución provincial.

La iniciativa, impulsada originalmente por Junts, modifica el Código Penal para permitir condenas de hasta tres años de prisión a quienes cometan hurtos de forma reiterada, incluso cuando el valor total de lo sustraído no supere los 400 euros, así como cuando el objeto robado sea un teléfono móvil u otro dispositivo electrónico.

La norma también introduce cambios en la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal para permitir que los ayuntamientos ejerzan la acción penal cuando la Fiscalía no actúe. Además, a través de enmiendas pactadas entre PSOE, PP y Junts, el endurecimiento de las penas se extiende a la multirreincidencia en delitos de estafa y se incorpora al Código Penal el delito de aprovisionamiento de combustible a embarcaciones utilizadas por narcotraficantes, conocido como petaqueo.

En ese periodo, entre 500.000 y un millón de personas de origen mexicano fueron obligadas o presionadas a abandonar el país, aunque algunas estimaciones elevan la cifra hasta los dos millones. Lo más grave es que entre el 40% y el 60% de los afectados eran ciudadanos estadounidenses, en su mayoría menores nacidos en Estados Unidos.

Aunque el Gobierno federal respaldó estas políticas, la iniciativa partió principalmente de autoridades estatales y locales, con el apoyo de organizaciones privadas. Las deportaciones formales fueron menores que las salidas “voluntarias”, pero estas últimas estuvieron marcadas por la coacción, la desinformación y el miedo. Las redadas se concentraron especialmente entre 1930 y 1933, bajo la presidencia de Herbert Hoover, y alcanzaron su punto álgido en 1931.

Sin embargo, críticos de la propuesta, incluidos congresistas demócratas y organizaciones de derechos civiles, argumentan que afectaría desproporcionadamente a mujeres, votantes rurales y familias de bajos ingresos. Uno de los puntos de mayor controversia es que esta medida podría impedir a millones de mujeres votar, debido a la discrepancia entre los apellidos que figuran en sus documentos de ciudadanía y en sus registros matrimoniales.

Tras identificar el marcador con un número de contacto, los pescadores avisaron a los investigadores, documentaron la captura y devolvieron el pez al agua, evidenciando el alto grado de implicación del sector pesquero local.

Históricamente, el esturión fue una especie común en numerosos ríos españoles, pero la construcción de presas y azudes que interrumpieron su migración reproductiva, junto con la sobreexplotación pesquera, provocaron su desaparición progresiva a lo largo del siglo XX.

Este aumento de la deuda se debe a la combinación de grandes déficits fiscales y el crecimiento de los intereses de la deuda. A pesar de los esfuerzos del gobierno de Donald Trump por reducir el déficit mediante recortes en servicios públicos y recaudación fiscal, la situación económica sigue empeorando, con un déficit proyectado de 1,9 billones de dólares en 2026. Si no se adoptan cambios significativos en la política fiscal, el déficit podría superar los 3 billones de dólares en 2036, lo que representaría un 6,7% del PIB, un nivel mucho más alto que el promedio de los últimos 50 años. Expertos destacan que, aunque la economía sigue creciendo, el aumento de la deuda pública podría afectar la estabilidad económica y las finanzas a largo plazo.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estados-unidos-enfrentara-un-nivel-de-deuda-publica-record-en-la-proxima-decada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estados-unidos-enfrentara-un-nivel-de-deuda-publica-record-en-la-proxima-decada</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google lanza alerta sísmica en Chile: usuarios sorprendidos por la anticipación del temblor]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un sismo de magnitud 6.1 sacudió Chile, con epicentro en Punitaqui, pero un detalle causó gran sorpresa: Google lanzó una alerta sísmica en Android minutos antes del temblor.

Sin embargo, esta transacción estuvo rodeada de controversia, ya que el territorio pertenecía a España en ese momento. La historia remonta a 1762, cuando Luisiana fue cedida a España. Aunque en 1800, por medio del Tratado de San Ildefonso, España devolvió el territorio a Francia, este acuerdo prohibía a Napoleón venderlo a terceros, algo que él ignoró. En 1803, Napoleón vendió Luisiana a los Estados Unidos, a pesar de que España aún controlaba muchas áreas del territorio. Las banderas españolas seguían ondeando y los administradores del territorio seguían siendo españoles, lo que llevó a España a protestar ante la venta, pero sin capacidad para enfrentar a Napoleón. Este episodio ha sido catalogado como uno de los mayores fraudes inmobiliarios de la historia, ya que se vendió un territorio que, en realidad, no pertenecía a Francia en el momento de la transacción.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fraude-inmobiliario-de-la-venta-de-luisiana-la-historia-de-como-francia-engano-a-eeuu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fraude-inmobiliario-de-la-venta-de-luisiana-la-historia-de-como-francia-engano-a-eeuu</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 23:25:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP aprueba una ley que otorga voto a las universidades privadas en el sistema académico andaluz]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Parlamento andaluz ha aprobado la nueva Ley Universitaria para Andalucía (LUPA), con el apoyo exclusivo del PP y el rechazo unánime de la oposición.

En 2021, un piso de 90 metros cuadrados costaba alrededor de 884 euros al mes, mientras que hoy esa misma vivienda alcanza los 1.291 euros. La Comunidad de Madrid lidera este incremento, con un aumento del 80%, alcanzando los 1.963 euros mensuales. Este encarecimiento se debe a factores como la escasez de oferta, la creciente demanda, el auge del alquiler turístico y el alquiler por habitaciones, que han hecho que muchas personas con salarios similares a los de hace cinco años tengan que pagar hasta un 50% más por sus viviendas. Otras regiones como Baleares y Cataluña también registran incrementos significativos.

Sin embargo, Vox ha rechazado la propuesta, tachándola de 'fanatismo climático'.

La moción, presentada inicialmente por el PSOE y enmendada por el PP, propone aumentar la red de refugios, especialmente para las personas mayores. La propuesta ha sido aprobada con la mayoría del PP y la abstención de PSOE y Hacemos Córdoba, mientras que Vox votó en contra. Además, se ha establecido un protocolo para activar la red de refugios durante los picos de calor.

Según Pappé, el sionismo ha creado la falacia de que Israel es una democracia, cuando en realidad discrimina a los palestinos y niega sus derechos fundamentales. Además, Pappé predice el colapso interno de Israel, similar a lo ocurrido con el apartheid en Sudáfrica, y aboga por una descolonización pacífica del país. Considera que las tensiones internas entre el 'Estado de Judea' y el 'Estado de Israel' podrían llevar a la desaparición del Estado actual, dejando paso a nuevas oportunidades para la paz en la región. En este sentido, el historiador apuesta por un futuro en el que el pueblo palestino pueda ocupar un rol fundamental en la construcción de una nueva estructura política y cultural más inclusiva y justa, y en el que la diáspora judía, sobre todo en Estados Unidos, pueda tener un papel importante en este proce]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ilan-pappe-sobre-el-sionismo-y-el-futuro-de-israel-una-critica-al-regimen-y-la-descolonizacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ilan-pappe-sobre-el-sionismo-y-el-futuro-de-israel-una-critica-al-regimen-y-la-descolonizacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Congresista denuncia seguimiento del Departamento de Justicia durante revisión de archivos de Epstein]]></title><description><![CDATA[La congresista demócrata Pramila Jayapal ha acusado al Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) de realizar un seguimiento de su historial de búsquedas mientras revisaba archivos sin censura relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein.

Desde 1915, el ejército alemán fue pionero en el uso de gas venenoso, un arma letal que pronto se extendió a todos los bandos. El gas cloro, fosgeno y mostaza fueron los principales agentes empleados, causando una gran cantidad de muertes y lesiones graves. El primer ataque significativo con gas tuvo lugar en la Segunda Batalla de Ypres, donde 168 toneladas de gas de cloro causaron la muerte de miles de soldados aliados. A pesar de su alta mortalidad, el gas no fue determinante en términos estratégicos debido a factores como el viento y las defensas con máscaras antigás. Sin embargo, su efecto psicológico fue devastador, creando un temor constante entre los combatientes. Aunque la guerra química dejó un millón de víctimas y los esfuerzos posteriores intentaron prohibir su uso, el gas venenoso sigue apareciendo en algunos conflictos bélicos act]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-gas-venenoso-en-la-primera-guerra-mundial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-impacto-del-gas-venenoso-en-la-primera-guerra-mundial</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 20:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Agresión racista a un joven senegalés en Camas, Sevilla]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un joven senegalés fue atacado el pasado fin de semana en Camas (Sevilla) por tres encapuchados, quienes lo golpearon y apuñalaron mientras le proferían insultos racistas.

Courier explica cómo en su época los jugadores podían permitirse debilidades técnicas, mientras que hoy el margen de error es mínimo, ejemplificando con jóvenes como Alcaraz y Sinner que no muestran puntos débiles. Además, relata su propia experiencia en el circuito profesional, donde la ausencia de expectativas externas alimentó su ambición y le permitió avanzar paso a paso, desde el top 100 hasta convertirse en campeón de Grand Slam.

Además, ha sido condenado por otras agresiones previas.

La discusión toma como ejemplo figuras como Epstein, quienes ejercen su poder de manera arbitraria y deshumanizada. El texto aborda la desconexión entre las grandes fortunas y las cualidades personales de quienes las gestionan, destacando los efectos morales devastadores que genera este poder, tanto en quienes lo ejercen como en la sociedad en su conjunto. Además, se explora la tendencia a la perversión moral que surge en individuos con poder absoluto, especialmente cuando buscan el placer por sí mismo, sin propósito ni significado. En el análisis, se menciona el impacto histórico de la filosofía del Marqués de Sade, quien promovió una visión del ser humano como máquina al servicio del placer.

Estas obras fueron 'perdidas' tras la disolución de la Sociedad Española de Amigos del Arte a principios de los años 80, y, de acuerdo con la información oficial, se encontraban depositadas en el Palacio desde 1973. Sin embargo, lo que parecía un misterio se resolvió de manera algo sospechosa, con una actitud de pasividad tanto de la Casa de Alba como de los medios. La Casa de Alba admitió que además del cuadro de Sorolla, había otras dos obras robadas. Lo que se ha considerado una colaboración, en otros contextos podría haber sido motivo suficiente para un registro exhaustivo y un interrogatorio más profundo.

Además, el consejero subrayó que la derogación de la ley no afectará a la estabilidad laboral del profesorado de religión, ya que se les ofrecerán nuevas opciones dentro del sistema educativo.

Sin embargo, la defensa cuestionó la credibilidad de la denuncia, señalando que no existían pruebas médicas ni testimonios que corroboraran los hechos.

A través de un colaborador, Tyler Shears, Epstein contrató a profesionales para mejorar su imagen pública en Google, promoviendo su filantropía y desenterrando noticias negativas sobre sus crímenes. Entre las acciones realizadas, Shears colocó artículos favorables sobre Epstein en medios de prestigio, como Forbes y Huffington Post, para que se posicionaran más alto en los resultados de búsqueda. Además, Epstein financió dominios web como jeffreyepstein.net y JeffreyEpstein.org, que destacaban su apoyo a la inteligencia artificial y sus donaciones a universidades.

Tras la final entre los Seattle Seahawks y los New England Patriots, cerca de 1.000 jets privados despegaron de los aeropuertos del Área de la Bahía. La web especializada Flightradar informó de un incremento del 1136% en las salidas de aviones privados en comparación con el domingo anterior. Entre los aviones más destacados estuvo el Gulfstream G650 de Kim Kardashian, y el Bombardier Global 7500 de Jay-Z y Beyoncé. Además, los aeropuertos cercanos como el de San José fueron escenario de una saturación inusual, con plazas de aparcamiento para jets privados que costaban entre 3.000 y 40.000 dólares. La locura se desató poco después de que los Seahawks ganaran el partido por 29-13, reflejando la magnitud del evento y el lujo asociado a los asistentes más exclusivos.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-de-jets-privados-tras-la-super-bowl-2026-mas-de-1-000-vuelos-en-pocas-horas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/record-de-jets-privados-tras-la-super-bowl-2026-mas-de-1-000-vuelos-en-pocas-horas</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 13:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El PP de Algeciras se burla de una edil del PSOE mientras se discutía un homenaje a las víctimas del nazismo]]></title><description><![CDATA[En un tenso pleno del Ayuntamiento de Algeciras, el presidente del PP local, Jacinto Muñoz, hizo una burla en tono irónico hacia la edil socialista Rocío Arrabal mientras ella defendía una moción para rendir homenaje a los algecireños deportados a los campos de concentración nazis. El hecho ocurrió en presencia de la familia de uno de los deportados, Andrés Sánchez, cuya historia de sufrimiento durante el Holocausto fue rememorada en el pleno. La actitud del edil del PP ha sido condenada por colectivos memorialistas y la Federación Andaluza de Memoria Democrática, que exigen una disculpa pública.

Estas decisiones, anunciadas por el ministro de Finanzas israelí Bezalel Smotrich, permiten a los colonos judíos un mayor control sobre las tierras palestinas, lo que se considera un ataque a la idea de un Estado palestino independiente. Entre las medidas se destacan la eliminación de restricciones sobre la venta de tierras a judíos y la creación de nuevos procedimientos para la planificación y legalización de asentamientos. La comunidad internacional, incluyendo al Reino Unido, ha expresado su rechazo, considerando que las acciones israelíes violan el derecho internacional y fomentan la violencia en la región.

La oposición acusó al Gobierno regional y al PP de proteger al regidor, que continúa en su cargo, y de intentar ocultar o minimizar la denuncia, que fue archivada tanto por el PP de Madrid como por el nacional sin una investigación adecuada. Manuela Bergerot (Más Madrid) señaló a Ayuso como responsable de que Bautista no dimitiera y criticó duramente al secretario general del PP madrileño, Alfonso Serrano, por sus comentarios despectivos sobre el caso.

Su llegada al Tour de Francia coincidió con el caso Festina, una experiencia que transformó lo que debía ser un sueño en una etapa marcada por la sospecha y el descrédito. Voigt explica el impacto personal y familiar de competir bajo una duda constante, incluso para quienes no formaron parte de prácticas ilícitas.

Durante años ejerció como una voz incómoda dentro del pelotón, defendiendo la necesidad de hablar abiertamente del dopaje. Esa posición le situó en medio de un ciclismo dividido entre quienes pedían silencio y quienes exigían mayor contundencia.

Además, se le entregó la medalla a Trump debido al 250 aniversario de la independencia de Estados Unidos, en un contexto marcado por la influencia del movimiento MAGA.

El tribunal desestimó la apelación de la Fiscalía, que había solicitado una condena por delito de odio. La sentencia subraya que el motivo de la agresión fue la forma de vestir del joven, no su orientación sexual.

A pesar de las amenazas del presidente a los legisladores republicanos que votaron en contra de los aranceles, el voto final fue de 219 a 211. Esta decisión marca un raro desafío bipartidista a la Casa Blanca, aunque la medida tiene un carácter simbólico, ya que cualquier cambio real en la política de aranceles dependería de la firma de Trump, quien ya ha advertido sobre las consecuencias políticas de contradecirlo.

Además, los participantes con mayor enriquecimiento cognitivo tuvieron un retraso de más de cinco años en la aparición de Alzheimer y hasta siete años en el caso de MCI. Los investigadores sugieren que fomentar entornos estimulantes como bibliotecas o programas educativos podría ser clave para reducir la incidencia de la demencia en el futuro.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-lectura-y-la-escritura-podrian-reducir-el-riesgo-de-demencia-significativamente-segun-un-estudio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-lectura-y-la-escritura-podrian-reducir-el-riesgo-de-demencia-significativamente-segun-un-estudio</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Identifican a la autora del tiroteo en Canadá como una mujer transgénero que mató a su madre antes de atacar el colegio]]></title><description><![CDATA[El tiroteo ocurrido en Tumbler Ridge, Canadá, el pasado martes, ha dejado un saldo de 10 víctimas mortales, incluyendo a la agresora, quien se identificaba como mujer transgénero. La policía identificó a la autora del ataque como Jesse van Rootselaar, de 18 años, quien antes de cometer la matanza en el instituto, mató a su madre de 39 años y a su hermano de 11 años. En el colegio, la atacante acabó con la vida de ocho personas, entre ellas una profesora y varias niñas y niños. La policía, que desconocía el motivo detrás del ataque, indicó que la licencia de armas de Jesse expiró en 2024, por lo que no tenía armas legales en su poder. Tras el tiroteo, Jesse se suicidó. Aunque se sospechaba que el número de víctimas mortales solo en el instituto era mayor, se aclaró que dos estudiantes sobrevivieron a sus heridas y se encuentran en estado grave.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/identifican-a-la-autora-del-tiroteo-en-canada-como-una-mujer-transgenero-que-mato-a-su-madre-antes-de-atacar-el-colegio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/identifican-a-la-autora-del-tiroteo-en-canada-como-una-mujer-transgenero-que-mato-a-su-madre-antes-de-atacar-el-colegio</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 10:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gallup suspende las encuestas sobre la aprobación presidencial en EE.

Este cambio ha generado incertidumbre, dado que Gallup ha sido una de las principales fuentes de datos sobre la percepción pública de los mandatarios. La decisión responde a cambios en la metodología y a la dificultad de obtener muestras representativas. Aunque Gallup continuará realizando otros tipos de encuestas, esta interrupción marca un punto de inflexión en el análisis político del país. Expertos en sondeos políticos se han mostrado sorprendidos y algunos sugieren que el cambio puede reflejar una evolución en las tendencias de consumo de datos en la era digital, donde las encuestas tradicionales han perdido algo de relevancia.

Durante más de 26 años, miles de trabajadores migrantes han estado viviendo en condiciones deplorables en asentamientos chabolistas, sin acceso a servicios básicos como electricidad o agua corriente. La mayoría de estos trabajadores son migrantes irregulares que enfrentan explotación laboral y social, muchos de ellos pagando altas sumas por conseguir trabajo o un contrato. A pesar de las denuncias internacionales y de algunas medidas como el Plan Integral para la Erradicación del Chabolismo, la situación sigue sin cambiar. En 2024, la Inspección de Trabajo registró más de mil infracciones en el sector, y los salarios son inferiores al mínimo legal.

Este sistema permitía a las empresas pagar parte del salario con vales alimentarios, que no se computaban para aportes previsionales ni otros beneficios laborales. La propuesta está incluida en el borrador de la Reforma Laboral, que busca modernizar el esquema con la finalidad de incentivar la formalización laboral y reducir la carga impositiva de las empresas. Sin embargo, los sindicatos advierten sobre los riesgos de precarización que esto podría conllevar, como la fragmentación salarial y la afectación de derechos como la antigüedad, las indemnizaciones y los aportes jubilatorios.

Durante la Guerra Fría, la aviación de combate estadounidense buscaba contrarrestar la amenaza de los misiles soviéticos, y para ello necesitaba desarrollar aviones capaces de evitar la detección por radar. En 1974, el proyecto ‘Have Blue’ fue lanzado con el objetivo de crear un caza que priorizara la invisibilidad en lugar de la velocidad. Los ingenieros de Lockheed descubrieron un trabajo de Ufimtsev sobre cómo las ondas electromagnéticas se dispersan en superficies angulares, lo que llevó a la creación de un avión con un diseño que minimizaba la firma radar. El F-117, a pesar de ser subsonico y no contar con superficies curvadas, marcó el comienzo de una nueva era en la aviación militar.

Este estudio, basado en fuentes clásicas y hallazgos arqueológicos, explora cómo este gesto sirvió tanto para sellar pactos de amistad como para representar castigos y trofeos de guerra. La mano derecha era un símbolo de hospitalidad y unión, utilizado en ceremonias de concordia, como los pactos entre los celtíberos y los romanos. Las téseras de hospitalidad, piezas de bronce en forma de manos entrelazadas, evidencian estos acuerdos. Sin embargo, la mano también simbolizaba la mutilación y el castigo en la guerra. La práctica de amputar manos de los enemigos como trofeo era común, aunque el estudio matiza que a menudo fue exagerada en los relatos romanos.

La periodista había preguntado a Quiles sobre sus financiadores, lo que provocó una reacción hostil. El agresor, en tono amenazante, le dijo: 'Dame la pistola que lo hago yo', mientras Quiles se reía y se marchaba sin intervenir. La periodista reaccionó públicamente, pidiendo que se identificara al agresor y denunciando la actitud de Quiles. El incidente fue grabado y compartido por Canal Red para visibilizar las amenazas, lo que generó gran repercusión en las redes sociales, con apoyos a la periodista y críticas a los comportamientos de los ultras.

Entre las propuestas clave se incluyen la extensión de la jornada laboral hasta 12 horas, la eliminación de indemnizaciones por despido y una reducción de los derechos a huelga, al imponer servicios mínimos en sectores esenciales. Además, el proyecto permite el pago de salarios en especie y la creación de un Fondo de Asistencia Laboral financiado por los empresarios. Las centrales sindicales, como la CGT, se oponen firmemente, advirtiendo que la reforma debilita los derechos laborales y la negociación colectiva.

El caso ha resurgido en un contexto en el que la administración Trump sigue enfrentando diversas investigaciones.

Además, se busca evitar que estas empresas sean adquiridas por fondos de inversión. La ley también propondría beneficios fiscales para las empresas que implementen estos planes y sanciones para las que no lo hagan.

Ramos señala que la hipocresía de la derecha se hace evidente en su defensa de causas como la protección de la infancia mientras callan ante los abusos de figuras poderosas, como Jeffrey Epstein. Además, critica cómo estas actitudes son normalizadas y cómo los partidos políticos tradicionales, como el PP, terminan cediendo ante las políticas de la extrema derecha, lo que lleva a la pérdida de su propio centro y moderación.

Aunque la ley de dependencia, instaurada en 2006, permitió avances significativos en el acceso a prestaciones, persisten problemas como las listas de espera desiguales entre comunidades, la dependencia del cuidado informal y la falta de evaluación de la calidad asistencial.

Esta sugerencia se presenta como una alternativa a imponer aranceles directos del 30% a China, lo cual podría generar conflictos políticos dentro de la UE. Según los expertos, China tiene una ventaja competitiva debido a su moneda subvaluada y su industria subsidiada, lo que ha permitido al país aumentar su cuota de mercado a expensas de la industria europea. La devaluación del euro se considera una opción más sencilla que los aranceles, pero podría tener implicaciones en la competitividad de la UE a nivel global. China ya ha advertido que imponer estos aranceles sería una declaración de guerra comercial.

La investigación, desarrollada por la Guardia Civil en el marco de la operación ‘URGI 26 ROLO’, describe un patrón reiterado de engaño, planificación y agresión con un marcado componente de odio.

Según el auto judicial, el principal investigado empleaba un perfil falso en la aplicación, con fotografías sustraídas a un tercero, para generar confianza y concertar encuentros. Las citas se fijaban inicialmente en una calle concreta, pero en el último momento se desviaba a las víctimas a otra ubicación más aislada, lo que facilitaba la emboscada. Allí, varios individuos actuaban en grupo, con el rostro cubierto por pasamontañas, para intimidar, golpear y robar.

La defensora del movimiento MAGA se mostró indignada por el hecho de que el artista puertorriqueño cantara en español, argumentando que el espectáculo debía ser un evento unificador para todo el país, no solo para la comunidad latina. Su postura desató un intenso debate sobre la relación entre inmigración, cultura y el significado de eventos de gran trascendencia nacional como el Super Bowl. Kelly defendió que el espectáculo debería haber sido más representativo de la cultura estadounidense, subrayando su rechazo a la inclusión del español en este tipo de eventos.

Este enclave había sido empleado de forma intermitente durante unos 700 años, pese a que las poblaciones de bisontes seguían siendo abundantes en la región cuando el lugar fue finalmente abandonado.

El equipo de investigación, liderado por el paleoecólogo John Wendt, combinó excavaciones arqueológicas, análisis de sedimentos, estudios de polen y carbón vegetal, y reconstrucciones climáticas para comprender qué motivó el cese de la actividad humana en la zona. Los resultados descartan que el abandono se debiera a una desaparición de los bisontes, a cambios significativos en la vegetación o a una alteración relevante en los regímenes de incendios.

Esta avispa deposita sus huevos en el interior de las larvas de la polilla de la col (Plutella xylostella), una de las principales plagas agrícolas de cultivos como la col, el brócoli o la colza, responsable de pérdidas de miles de millones de euros a nivel mundial.

Junto a los huevos, la avispa inocula un virus integrado en su propio genoma. Este patógeno logra evadir el sistema inmunitario del hospedador y, además, interfiere de forma directa en su desarrollo reproductivo. El estudio, publicado en la revista PNAS, demuestra que uno de los genes virales codifica una enzima (PTP) que se une a la proteína Rad9A, clave en la regulación de la apoptosis o muerte celular programada.

Las empresas que no cumplan con esta legislación, que exige la divulgación de las bandas salariales y la eliminación del secreto salarial, no podrán acceder a contratos públicos. Esto podría ser un golpe importante para las empresas que no logren adaptarse a los requisitos, ya que los Estados miembros de la UE deberán implementar sanciones contra las empresas infractoras. Además, las empresas de más de 250 trabajadores tendrán que publicar anualmente las diferencias salariales entre hombres y mujeres.

Entre ellos destaca Antonio Burgueño, exasesor sanitario de Isabel Díaz Ayuso y principal responsable del diseño del denominado Plan de Choque frente a la pandemia. Dicho plan incluía como medida central la medicalización de las residencias, una actuación que finalmente no se llevó a cabo de forma efectiva.

El Juzgado de Instrucción número 2 de Collado Villalba ha citado a Burgueño en calidad de investigado, después de dos intentos fallidos previos en otros juzgados.

El eje central es la tesis de que el PSOE fue reconstruido en los años setenta con el apoyo y la influencia de servicios de inteligencia occidentales, especialmente la CIA estadounidense y la socialdemocracia alemana, con el objetivo de frenar el avance del Partido Comunista tras la muerte de Franco.

El artículo sitúa como punto clave el Congreso de Suresnes de 1974, donde Felipe González, bajo el nombre de “Isidoro”, accede a la secretaría general del partido. Se describe cómo sectores del franquismo tardío y del SECED facilitaron pasaportes, contactos y una cierta tolerancia policial hacia los socialistas del interior, mientras la represión se concentraba en los comunistas.

Según la propia Santaolalla, el presentador del programa la señaló, una colaboradora la insultó y el resto de la mesa se rió, lo que ella considera un ejemplo de violencia desde un plató de televisión. La tertuliana subrayó en sus redes sociales que este tipo de ataques no ocurrieron en la calle, sino en un espacio supuestamente familiar, y expresó su frustración por tener que enfrentarse a comentarios ofensivos de manera recurrente.

A través de fuentes como Homero, Hesíodo o Heródoto, se explica que los escenarios mitológicos se sitúan en un territorio ambiguo, a medio camino entre lo real y lo imaginario, donde la precisión geográfica carece de importancia frente al valor simbólico del relato.

La geografía mitológica se caracteriza por la idealización, el aislamiento y la anacronía. Los lugares donde transcurren los mitos suelen aparecer como espacios lejanos, inaccesibles o peligrosos, pero también como paraísos o territorios “dorados”, cargados de riqueza y maravilla. Estos espacios existen únicamente para que el mito tenga lugar y no están sometidos a las leyes normales del tiempo ni del clima, lo que explica fenómenos como la luz perpetua, la noche eterna o la ause]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/como-los-griegos-antiguos-concibieron-el-espacio-mitico-entre-la-realidad-y-la-imaginacion</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia plantea eliminar las últimas paradas de venta directa de los agricultores de la Huerta]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Valencia ha anunciado su intención de modificar la Ordenanza de Mercados, incluyendo como primera medida el cierre de las últimas paradas de venta directa conocidas como la 'Tira de Comptar'. Esta figura tiene un origen medieval, consolidado por Jaume I, que permitía a los agricultores de la Huerta vender sus productos frescos directamente en la ciudad. Ni siquiera las prohibiciones de Felip V lograron eliminar esta tradición, que hoy se mantiene en muy pocas paradas, principalmente en el Mercat del Cabanyal y el de Mossén Sorell. Según el equipo municipal, la nueva ordenanza busca revitalizar los mercados municipales, argumentando que estas paradas generan competencia desleal. Sin embargo, colectivos como Per l’Horta consideran que la acusación es infundada y que estas paradas, aunque simbólicas, son procompetitivas y ofrecen productos frescos cultivados por los propios agricultores, a diferencia de otras verdulerías que revenden productos de mayoristas.

En concreto, ha contrapuesto la actuación del ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, tras el accidente ferroviario de Adamuz, con la del president de la Generalitat Valenciana, Carlos Mazón, durante la reciente dana que afectó a su comunidad.

Rufián ha subrayado que Puente compareció públicamente pocas horas después del accidente para dar explicaciones, mientras que Mazón, según sus palabras, permaneció ausente durante varias horas clave en plena emergencia, llegando a ironizar con que estaba “tomándose la tercera copa”. Para el dirigente republicano, ambos comportamientos no son comparables y desmontan las críticas del PP a la gestión del Gobierno central.

El informe indica que este descenso continuado sitúa a España por detrás de países como Ruanda o Arabia Saudí, que normalmente se consideran regímenes menos democráticos, y solo ligeramente por encima de otros países con niveles similares de puntuación. La tendencia negativa se ha mantenido durante varios años, reflejando una percepción creciente de prácticas corruptas y una erosión de la confianza en las instituciones.

El aviso a la policía se produjo alrededor de las tres de la madrugada, alertando de una pelea violenta entre dos compañeras de piso en un domicilio de la calle Cartagena, cerca del Hospital de Sant Pau.

Cuando los agentes llegaron al lugar, encontraron a dos mujeres de 29 y 30 años, de nacionalidad hondureña y peruana, ambas con múltiples lesiones visibles. Una de ellas presentaba heridas especialmente graves, entre ellas la pérdida parcial de una oreja, además de mordeduras repartidas por diversas partes del cuerpo.

La trabajadora, con un salario mensual superior a 3.000 euros, utilizaba tanto su acceso como claves de otros compañeros para procesar devoluciones de manera fraudulenta, acumulando cerca de 2.000 euros de manera irregular. La auditoría interna detectó un patrón de operaciones sospechosas: devoluciones múltiples en fechas concretas sin solicitud real de los viajeros. La sentencia del TSJA ratifica que estas acciones constituyen un incumplimiento grave de la buena fe contractual y justifican el despido disciplinario.

Esta norma se inserta en el contexto del Reglamento Europeo de Inteligencia Artificial y del proceso de digitalización de la justicia impulsado por la normativa estatal reciente, fijando principios, límites y responsabilidades claras para jueces y magistrados.

La Instrucción parte de una idea central: la IA solo puede ser un instrumento de apoyo y nunca sustituir al juez en la toma de decisiones. Para ello, establece principios como el control humano efectivo, la responsabilidad exclusiva del juzgador, la independencia judicial, el respeto a los derechos fundamentales, la confidencialidad de los datos y la prevención de sesgos algorítmicos.

Sin embargo, la medida más controvertida no es el precio, sino la aplicación de la cláusula de 'no renovación' para pacientes con enfermedades crónicas o de edad avanzada. Durante años, el modelo de negocio se basó en captar clientes sanos con primas bajas, pero ahora, ante el aumento del uso intensivo de la cobertura, muchas aseguradoras deciden no renovar contratos a quienes dejan de ser rentables. Además, se han endurecido los procedimientos para acceder a pruebas diagnósticas y tratamientos menores, generando retrasos que imitan las limitaciones de la sanidad pública. El resultado es un sistema de selección de riesgos que prioriza a los pacientes jóvenes y sanos, derivando al resto de facto al sistema público.

El examen oficial del Condado de King determinó en su momento que fue un suicidio. Sin embargo, un equipo privado de científicos forenses, liderado por Brian Burnett y la investigadora Michelle Wilkins, revisó la autopsia y el escenario del crimen. Tras tres días de análisis, el equipo concluyó que la evidencia era consistente con un homicidio. Señalaron que el daño en órganos como el cerebro y el hígado indicaba falta de oxígeno, más común en una sobredosis de heroína que en un disparo instantáneo. Además, la disposición de las manos, la limpieza de la mano izquierda, la ubicación de la escopeta y de los proyectiles, así como la nota de suicidio, mostraban anomalías que no encajan con un suicidio t]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nueva-investigacion-forense-plantea-dudas-sobre-la-muerte-de-kurt-cobain</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nueva-investigacion-forense-plantea-dudas-sobre-la-muerte-de-kurt-cobain</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 12:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yolanda Díaz no se reúne con sindicatos nacionalistas que solicitan SMI propio]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los sindicatos nacionalistas CIG, ELA, LAB, Intersindical Catalá, IAC, Intersindical Valenciana y STEI anunciaron su intención de reunirse en Madrid con los partidos políticos del Congreso para abordar la posibilidad de establecer un salario mínimo interprofesional (SMI) adaptado a sus territorios.

El animal fue atrapado en abril de 2023 por un pescador a unas once millas náuticas entre Dénia y Jávea, cerca del Cabo de San Antonio, una zona de cañones submarinos y aguas profundas próximas a la costa. El tiburón medía alrededor de 2,1 metros y pesaba entre 80 y 90 kilos, lo que indica que se trataba de un individuo joven, muy lejos aún del tamaño adulto de esta especie.

El hallazgo, publicado en la revista científica Acta Ichthyologica et Piscatoria, confirma que el tiburón blanco mantiene una presencia persistente pero extremadamente infrecuente en aguas españolas.

Sin embargo, al llegar a Rusia, se encontraron con contratos militares que no podían leer y amenazas de muerte si no los firmaban. Muchos compatriotas no sobrevivieron, y los supervivientes muestran cicatrices físicas y psicológicas por las experiencias en el frente, incluyendo ataques de drones y la visión de cadáveres.

El incidente se produjo a raíz de las continuas interrupciones y preguntas fuera de turno realizadas por Quiles, que, según Belarra, impidieron el normal desarrollo del acto informativo y el trabajo del resto de periodistas acreditados.

Durante la comparecencia, Belarra reprochó al agitador ultraderechista su actitud y cuestionó públicamente su independencia, afirmando que la ciudadanía tiene derecho a saber cuánto cobra y para quién trabaja. La dirigente de Podemos sostuvo que ella había respondido de forma reiterada a sus preguntas y le acusó de no dar explicaciones sobre su propia actividad, además de señalarle como alguien que, a su juicio, hace el “trabajo sucio” del Partido Popular y de Vox.

Según el informe, esta política comercial constituye el mayor aumento fiscal en Estados Unidos como porcentaje del PIB desde 1993 y está contribuyendo a agravar las preocupaciones sobre el coste de vida, afectando especialmente a productos importados como electrónica, juguetes, coches y alimentos cultivados en el extranjero. La inflación en alimentos se ha visto notablemente impactada, con subidas del 33,6% en el café, 19,3% en la carne de vacuno, 16,8% en la lechuga romana y 12,4% en el zumo de naranja congelado. La recaudación total por aranceles ascendió a 264.000 millones de dólares en 2025, muy por debajo de las expectativas de la Casa Blanca.

La propuesta de sentencia, que será debatida y previsiblemente aprobada, señala que, aunque el procedimiento utilizado fue inconstitucional, ello no afecta directamente al contenido de la ley de Telemadrid.

Según Trump, el país no aplicaba tarifas de manera adecuada y enviaba productos a EE. UU., generando un déficit comercial de 42.000 millones de dólares. Inicialmente, impuso un arancel del 30%, pero tras una llamada con la ministra suiza Karin Keller-Sutter, que describió como agresiva, decidió elevarlo al 39%. Esta decisión ha sido objeto de burlas en redes sociales, donde usuarios señalaron que la política arancelaria de Trump parecía impulsiva y basada en su estado de ánimo, más que en una estrategia económica definida. Posteriormente, bajo presión de empresas suizas, Trump accedió a reducir los aranceles al 15%, con un acuerdo preliminar que incluye la inversión de 200.000 millones de dólares por parte de Suiza en Estados Unidos antes de 2028.

El despiste ocurrió durante el proceso de compra en la plataforma Ticketmaster, donde ambos artistas tienen conciertos programados en España a lo largo de 2026. La similitud fonética entre los nombres y las prisas por conseguir entradas para el popular cantante puertorriqueño provocaron la confusión.

En un vídeo publicado en TikTok, una de las chicas aparece visiblemente afectada al darse cuenta de que había adquirido entradas para el concierto de Bunbury en Madrid, previsto para el 4 de diciembre en el Movistar Arena, con un precio de 165 euros.

Como consecuencia, el president afirmó erróneamente que no se habían activado alertas hidrológicas y dio por prácticamente superado el episodio meteorológico.

La comparecencia se produjo a las 11:47 de la mañana y fue retransmitida en directo por la televisión autonómica À Punt.

El anuncio fue comunicado a los gobernadores mediante una carta firmada por Kevin Stitt, gobernador republicano de Oklahoma y actual presidente de la NGA. En ella, Stitt explica que, al quedar excluidos los gobernadores demócratas de la reunión con el presidente, la asociación no podía seguir actuando como organizadora ni avalar un evento que contradice su misión principal: representar por igual a los 55 gobernadores y gobernadoras del país, incluidos los de estados y territorios.

Este resultado refleja una clara apuesta ciudadana por la moderación, la estabilidad institucional y el respeto al marco democrático, frente a los discursos excluyentes y polarizadores del populismo.

Seguro, un socialdemócrata de perfil moderado y alejado de la política activa durante más de una década, ha logrado un respaldo transversal poco habitual. Su candidatura atrajo apoyos tanto de figuras conservadoras como del ámbito comunista, lo que evidencia su capacidad para presentarse como un “presidente de todos”.

La entidad social señala que esta realidad afecta de manera especial a familias con menores, personas migrantes y trabajadores con ingresos inestables, que se ven obligados a convivir varias unidades familiares en un mismo piso o a ocupar viviendas sin las condiciones mínimas de habitabilidad.

El trabajo, realizado por científicos de la Universidad Tecnológica del Sur de China y publicado en la revista Device, no plantea una fuente de energía revolucionaria, pero sí una prueba de concepto ingeniosa sobre cómo captar energía ambiental para alimentar pequeños dispositivos.

El funcionamiento del pájaro bebedor se basa en un ciclo térmico sencillo. Al mojarse el pico y la cabeza de fieltro, el agua se evapora y enfría la parte superior del juguete. Este enfriamiento provoca la condensación del vapor del líquido interno, normalmente diclorometano, lo que reduce la presión en la parte superior del tubo.

El fenómeno, detectado en la mañana del martes y con una duración aproximada de una hora, no tiene precedentes en los veinte años de registros instrumentales en Tenerife. Según explicó Itahiza Domínguez, director del Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN) en Canarias, se trata de una serie de pulsos sísmicos de baja frecuencia que no pueden identificarse como terremotos individuales, a diferencia de los enjambres sísmicos habituales.

Los primeros análisis sitúan el origen de la señal en el oeste de Las Cañadas, a profundidades de entre 10 y 12 kilómetros, en la misma zona donde desde el fin de semana se han localizado más de 90 pequeños seísmos de magnitud inferior a 1,7, ninguno de ellos sentido por la población.

La compañía de Elon Musk ha obtenido una puntuación de 2,48 sobre 5, lo que supone una caída de 0,77 puntos respecto al año anterior, el mayor descenso registrado desde que se realiza este informe en 2013. En 2024, la marca había alcanzado 3,25 puntos.

El estudio, basado en encuestas a 27.000 personas, evalúa aspectos como dirección, finanzas, gestión, atención al cliente, calidad de productos y servicios, entorno laboral y sostenibilidad. Tesla no solo ha quedado en última posición, sino que ha sido superada en reputación por empresas de comercio electrónico como Temu o Shein.

Esta medida forma parte de una escalada en el conflicto entre el Kremlin y la plataforma fundada por Pável Dúrov, que se remonta a años anteriores con restricciones previas en llamadas de voz y vídeo. Las autoridades rusas justifican estas acciones alegando que Telegram no cumple con la legislación local, en particular en la eliminación de contenidos relacionados con fraudes, estafas y supuestos casos de terrorismo, lo que ha derivado también en multas millonarias que superan los 800.000 dólares.

Mientras el secretario del Tesoro, Bessent, defiende retóricamente un “dólar fuerte”, Trump y su equipo aceptan e incluso fomentan su debilitamiento, lo que ha generado volatilidad financiera global, subidas del oro y movimientos hacia activos considerados refugio, como el franco suizo.

La autora sostiene que esta estrategia es peligrosa porque el dólar sigue siendo central para el comercio internacional, la deuda soberana de muchos países pobres y la fijación de precios de materias primas clave. Su debilitamiento reduce el valor de los activos en dólares y tensiona los mercados, además de encarecer las importaciones en Estados Unidos y trasladar inflación a los consumidores.

La campaña surge tras la firma de una orden ejecutiva que declara una “emergencia nacional” por la supuesta amenaza que representa la isla, una calificación que los promotores consideran falsa y utilizada como pretexto para endurecer las sanciones económicas.

Según el manifiesto difundido por la iniciativa, el objetivo real de estas medidas es provocar una situación de escasez extrema de energía, alimentos y medicinas, lo que podría derivar en una crisis humanitaria de gran magnitud. La orden ejecutiva impide a Cuba importar petróleo y otras fuentes de energía, lo que tendría consecuencias directas sobre la vida cotidiana de la población, el funcionamiento de hospitales y la distribución de bienes básicos.

Tras revisar junto al congresista republicano Thomas Massie una versión sin censuras en el Departamento de Justicia, Khanna hizo públicos los nombres: el empresario estadounidense Leslie Wexner (fundador de Victoria's Secret, Abercrombie & Fitch y Bath & Body Works, señalado como posible 'cómplice' por el FBI), el empresario emiratí Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem (director de Dubai Ports World, mencionado en un correo de Epstein sobre un 'video de tortura'), y Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov y Nicola Caputo.

Según datos del catastro elaborados a partir de información del Ministerio de Hacienda, más de 75.000 titulares poseen al menos tres viviendas en la región, más de 10.000 cuentan con diez o más y 517 llegan a acumular hasta 50. Esta tendencia se produce en un contexto de precios del alquiler y de compraventa disparados, que dificultan el acceso a la vivienda para jóvenes y familias.

El fenómeno no se limita a la capital, aunque Madrid ciudad lidera todas las categorías de grandes tenedores. Municipios como Alcobendas, Parla, Getafe, Las Rozas, Alcalá de Henares o Móstoles también concentran decenas de propietarios con carteras muy amplias. En conjunto, el número de titulares con entre tres y más de 50 viviendas ha aumentado en más de 2.700 personas entre 2024 y 2026, lo que confirma que la acumulación de inmueble]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-concentracion-de-viviendas-en-madrid-sigue-creciendo-y-agrava-la-presion-sobre-el-mercado-del-alquiler</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-concentracion-de-viviendas-en-madrid-sigue-creciendo-y-agrava-la-presion-sobre-el-mercado-del-alquiler</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 23:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Gobierno aprueba un anteproyecto de ley para limitar la privatización sanitaria y derogar la norma de Aznar de 1997]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Sanidad, dirigido por Mónica García, ha impulsado un anteproyecto de Ley de Gestión Pública e Integridad del Sistema Nacional de Salud, aprobado en el Consejo de Ministros el 10 de febrero de 2026.

Deroga la Ley 15/1997 aprobada bajo el Gobierno de José María Aznar, que facilitó modelos de colaboración público-privada como el conocido 'modelo Alzira'.

Una mujer de 34 años, con un largo historial de robos en Palafrugell y otras localidades de la comarca, ha ingresado en prisión después de acumular cerca de 40 detenciones. Hasta ahora, pese a la frecuencia de las intervenciones policiales, la sospechosa quedaba en libertad pocas horas después de ser arrestada, lo que generaba una sensación de impunidad entre los vecinos y frustración entre los agentes.

El ingreso en la cárcel se produjo tras una nueva detención el pasado 7 de febrero, cuando la Policía Local de Palafrugell la sorprendió saliendo de una vivienda con una bolsa, poco después de haber accedido al interior.

Esta decisión se produce a pesar de que el Tribunal Constitucional había anulado previamente el veto impuesto por la Mesa de la Cámara, al estimar recursos de amparo presentados por PSOE y Más Madrid. El TC determinó por unanimidad que tales bloqueos vulneraban derechos de la oposición. Los dos diputados del PP en la Mesa votaron en contra, dejando en minoría al representante de Más Madrid.

El vuelo afectado, SK2590 con destino a Copenhague, había recibido autorización para despegar desde la pista 07R alrededor de las 22:03 hora local.

Según la información disponible, la tripulación alineó la aeronave en la calle de rodaje E1, una superficie no destinada a despegues, y comenzó la aceleración como si se encontrara en pista. El avión llegó a alcanzar aproximadamente 107 nudos antes de que los pilotos detectaran el error y decidieran abortar el despegue. Tras la maniobra, la aeronave terminó parcialmente fuera de la superficie pavimentada y quedó detenida en una zona de césped próxima a un área de almacenamiento de combustible del aeropuerto.

González, por su parte, reprochó al PSOE y al PP la falta de autocrítica política y propuso adelantar elecciones si no se aprueban los Presupuestos Generales del Estado.

Moltbook se plantea como una red social invertida: los humanos solo pueden observar, mientras que las IAs publican, moderan y toman decisiones mediante una API. En apenas días, miles de agentes se organizaron en comunidades, generaron debates filosóficos, crearon normas internas y delegaron la moderación en un agente autónomo cuya lógica interna ni siquiera sus creadores controlan plenamente.

Más allá de la infraestructura, el texto describe la cultura emergente de estos agentes.

En un acto celebrado en Boadilla del Monte, Ayuso ha acusado al Ejecutivo de Pedro Sánchez de mantener una “obsesión” con Madrid y de intentar “acabar” con su modelo sanitario mediante amenazas, imposiciones y mensajes que, a su juicio, buscan generar miedo entre la población.

Según Ayuso, la norma estatal supone un ataque directo a la colaboración público-privada que defiende su Gobierno y que considera clave para el funcionamiento de la sanidad madrileña. La presidenta ha defendido que este modelo ha sido respaldado en las urnas por los ciudadanos y ha insistido en que Madrid es una “región de libertad” donde administraciones y empresas deben cooperar para ofrecer servicios eficaces.

En una entrevista concedida al programa Nothing Major Show, el jugador kazajo admite que el dominio ejercido por Carlos Alcaraz y Jannik Sinner, junto a un Novak Djokovic en la recta final de su carrera, ha generado una jerarquía casi infranqueable en los grandes torneos. Según Bublik, esta situación ha cambiado incluso el discurso interno del vestuario: ningún jugador del top 10 se atreve ya a verbalizar abiertamente que aspira a ganar un Grand Slam.

El tenista describe un escenario en el que solo circunstancias excepcionales, como eliminaciones tempranas de los grandes favoritos, abrirían una ventana real de oportunidad para otros jugadores. Recuerda precedentes históricos en los que el cuadro se rompió de forma inesperada y sugiere que algo así podría volver a suceder, aunque de manera muy puntual en los próximos años.

El agredido llamó él mismo a emergencias, aunque después minimizó lo ocurrido y se mostró reacio a presentar denuncia contra su compañera. Cuando la Policía Nacional llegó al domicilio, la mujer intentó ocultar lo sucedido alegando que las manchas de sangre en su ropa eran de pintalabios rojo.

Según explicaron, la acción tuvo un carácter político y simbólico, al considerar que muchas familias no pueden afrontar el precio actual de los alimentos en un contexto de inflación persistente. El reparto se realizó en puntos de acceso comunitario, utilizados habitualmente por personas con dificultades económicas, lo que refuerza el mensaje de denuncia social que el grupo quiso transmitir.

Este retraso responde a varios factores, entre ellos la necesidad de centrarse en la Luna, donde SpaceX busca construir una ciudad lunar antes de 2036, lo que considera más viable en un plazo de diez años debido a la cercanía del satélite y la posibilidad de asegurar la supervivencia de los colonos. Además, la NASA, bajo la dirección de Jared Isaacman, impulsa la carrera lunar frente a China, lo que aumenta la presión sobre SpaceX para desarrollar el HLS (Human Landing System) y los sistemas de repostaje en órbita necesarios para Artemisa III en 2028.

Esta medida responde a incidentes previos en los que Irán ha incautado buques extranjeros alegando violaciones como contrabando. Aunque continúan los esfuerzos diplomáticos, mediados por Omán, para abordar el programa nuclear iraní, misiles balísticos y apoyo a grupos armados, Washington mantiene una postura firme.

El texto recuerda que, desde diciembre de 2025, Ayuso habría bloqueado investigaciones y silenciado el sufrimiento de niños con discapacidad abusados en un centro que debería ser seguro, mientras despliega recursos políticos para respaldar al alcalde de Móstoles, Manuel Bautista, acusado de acoso sexual por una exconcejala del PP. Los firmantes denuncian un encubrimiento sistemático de abusadores cuando estos pertenecen al PP, al Opus Dei o al círculo de poder, frente al abandono y oscurantismo hacia víctimas de entornos más vulnerables.

Nicholas Carlini, investigador de Anthropic, ha mostrado cómo el modelo Claude Opus 4.6, mediante un sistema de agentes trabajando en paralelo, ha sido capaz de generar un compilador de C completo en solo dos semanas y con un coste aproximado de 20.000 dólares. Este proyecto, denominado Claude's C Compiler (CCC), consta de 100.000 líneas de código en Rust y permite compilar un kernel Linux 6.9 funcional en arquitecturas x86, ARM y RISC-V. Comparativamente, desarrollar un compilador tradicional podía implicar inversiones millonarias y años de trabajo de múltiples ingenieros. Aunque el compilador creado por la IA tiene limitaciones, como la falta de soporte para x86 de 16 bits o su propio ensamblador, el logro demuestra el potencial de la IA generativa en acelerar y abaratar desarrollos de software complejos.

La instalación, de más de 500 metros cuadrados y en funcionamiento desde 1975, es propiedad de sus abuelos, quienes se la arriendan desde que ella asumió la titularidad de la ganadería en 2022. En ella mantiene alrededor de 50 animales de raza Asturiana de los Valles, entre vacas, crías y toros.

La expropiación está vinculada al proyecto de duplicación de la vía de ancho métrico entre Pola de Siero y La Carrera. Mientras que la indemnización ofrecida a los propietarios del inmueble asciende a 37.700 euros, a Molleda se le propone una compensación de apenas 6,50 euros en concepto de daños y perjuicios por el cese forzoso de su actividad en ese emplazamiento.

Después del paso de la borrasca Marta, que se suma a una temporada especialmente activa con ya 13 borrascas de gran impacto en lo que va del invierno 2025/2026, el patrón atmosférico comenzará a modificarse de forma clara.

Durante buena parte de la semana, el chorro polar ha circulado a latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, favoreciendo la llegada de masas de aire suaves y cargadas de humedad desde el Atlántico. Sin embargo, hacia el final de la semana este chorro se volverá más sinuoso, permitiendo la entrada de aire mucho más frío desde latitudes árticas. Este cambio estará reforzado por el desplazamiento de la dorsal anticiclónica hacia el sur de las Azores y la profundización de una baja en el entorno de Italia, lo que intensificará los vientos de componente norte y noroeste sobre la Península.

Los documentos indican que en 2011 Epstein se reunió con Christopher Poole, fundador del foro anónimo 4chan, poco antes del relanzamiento del tablón /pol/, que posteriormente se consolidó como espacio central de la llamada alt-right. Correos de su entorno describen ese foro como un “ente colectivo” con gran potencial de manipulación, lo que apunta a un interés estratégico en comunidades digitales difíciles de rastrear pero altamente influyentes.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el congresista republicano Ted Hill, elimina la excepción que en versiones anteriores permitía izar la ikurriña en contextos culturales, como el festival Jaialdi de Boise, que celebra la profunda presencia histórica de la diáspora vasca en la región.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en la decisión del Ayuntamiento de Boise, gobernado por la demócrata Lauren McLean, de mantener la bandera del Orgullo Progresivo más allá del mes del Orgullo. En respuesta, el Capitolio de Idaho aprobó en 2023 una ley que limitaba las enseñas autorizadas en edificios gubernamentales.

Los implicados eran trabajadores de empresas subcontratadas para el mantenimiento de las vías del tren, lo que les permitía acceder fácilmente al material y a los recursos necesarios.

La actividad delictiva se inició a finales de 2024 y consistía en la sustracción de cableado de cobre, tramos de vía, tornillería y otros elementos de las infraestructuras ferroviarias, principalmente en el tramo entre Vinaròs y Torreblanca.

El anuncio, lanzado en diciembre de 2025, utiliza el humor y la sátira para explicar de forma clara y accesible los argumentos oficiales que justifican la medida, así como sus posibles contradicciones y efectos secundarios.

El vídeo presenta la prohibición como una respuesta política a la creciente preocupación social por el impacto de las redes en la salud mental de niños y adolescentes, incluyendo problemas como la ansiedad, el acoso digital, la adicción a las pantallas o la exposición a contenidos nocivos. A través de un tono irónico, el anuncio expone cómo el Gobierno defiende la iniciativa como una forma de “proteger a los menores”, mientras evita abordar cuestiones estructurales como la falta de regulación efectiva de las grandes plataformas tecnológicas o ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bad Bunny agradece al equipo de Zara en Arteixo su colaboración en el vestuario de la Super Bowl]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los trabajadores de la sede central de Inditex en Arteixo, A Coruña, recibieron un inesperado reconocimiento por parte de Bad Bunny tras su actuación en el descanso de la Super Bowl 2026.

El gesto consistió en la entrega a los empleados de una camiseta similar a la que el cantante lució durante el espectáculo, personalizada con la fecha de la Super Bowl 2026. El regalo se completaba con una nota firmada por el propio Bad Bunny en la que agradecía “el tiempo, el talento y el corazón” puestos en el proyecto, subrayando que el espectáculo también había sido posible gracias a ellos.

Según la denuncia presentada el 18 de diciembre en el puesto principal de Aldaia, entre diez y doce personas accedieron por la fuerza a la vivienda acompañadas de un cerrajero.

Según datos de Eurostat, la proporción de población que vive en viviendas con menos habitaciones de las necesarias ha pasado del 4,7% en 2018 al 9,1% en 2024, lo que supone un incremento cercano al 94% en solo seis años. Este aumento contrasta con la evolución media del conjunto de la UE, donde el hacinamiento ha descendido ligeramente en el mismo periodo.

El fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y de la compra de vivienda, que obliga a muchas familias a reducir espacio y privacidad para poder acceder a un techo. Aunque España no se sitúa entre los países con mayores tasas absolutas —muy por debajo de algunos Estados del este de Europa—, sí destaca por la intensidad del crecimiento, solo comparable al caso de Irlanda.

Según la sentencia, los hechos ocurrieron en la madrugada del 1 de diciembre de 2023, después de que agresor y víctima, que mantenían una relación de amistad y compartían problemas de salud mental, salieran juntos de fiesta y consumieran alcohol y drogas.

El estudio, basado en registros civiles y documentación archivística, demuestra que estos centros vivieron una situación extrema de abandono institucional a medida que avanzaba el conflicto bélico.

El obturador es el elemento que controla el tiempo durante el cual la luz llega al sensor, influyendo directamente en la exposición y en la capacidad de congelar el movimiento.

El obturador mecánico, basado en cortinillas físicas, sigue siendo muy utilizado por su fiabilidad en todo tipo de condiciones de iluminación, su compatibilidad con el flash y su capacidad para capturar escenas con movimientos rápidos sin distorsiones. Sin embargo, presenta limitaciones como el ruido, las vibraciones y velocidades máximas más reducidas.

Este éxodo, uno de los episodios más trágicos de la Guerra Civil, dejó entre 3.000 y 5.000 víctimas civiles, en su mayoría mujeres, niños y ancianos, que fueron bombardeados por mar y aire durante el camino.

Pese a que el cine español ha tratado la Guerra Civil en más de un centenar de películas, ninguna había reflejado hasta ahora este episodio concreto. Arijo, que ha investigado a fondo la filmografía sobre el conflicto, considera que existía una deuda narrativa con la Desbandá.

El objeto, de apenas 63 milímetros de longitud y unos 1,5 gramos de peso, data del cuarto milenio antes de nuestra era y adelanta en más de dos milenios el uso fiable de la perforación rotatoria en Egipto.

Durante décadas, la pieza fue catalogada de forma imprecisa como una simple lezna de cobre, siguiendo una descripción escueta realizada en los años veinte por el arqueólogo Guy Brunton. Sin embargo, un nuevo reanálisis mediante microscopía ha revelado patrones de desgaste incompatibles con un uso por presión o percusión.

Aunque históricamente fue un pez muy abundante y presente en casi toda la península ibérica, la anguila ha perdido más del 80 % de su distribución original. El colapso más grave se produjo a partir de los años ochenta, coincidiendo con una intensificación de su explotación comercial, especialmente tras el declive de la anguila japonesa.

Tras conocerse el último escrito de la Fiscalía, que solicita la absolución de Errejón al considerar que no existió delito —ya que describe un encuentro sexual iniciado sin oposición inicial y finalizado cuando Mouliaá manifestó su negativa a continuar—, la actriz ha anunciado en la red social X que seguirá adelante con el proceso.

Antelo ha emitido un comunicado acompañado de imágenes del Ebro a su paso por Zaragoza, en el que insta al Partido Popular a exigirle a Azcón una rectificación pública de su posición sobre esta infraestructura hidráulica. Denuncia la ausencia de una política nacional del agua coherente y el bloqueo sistemático a las interconexiones de cuencas, defendiendo una gestión solidaria que lleve el agua 'de donde sobra a donde hace falta', como en Murcia.

En declaraciones realizadas en Mataró, donde participó en un acto sobre economía social, Díaz alertó de lo que calificó como una «emergencia democrática sin precedentes», tanto a nivel nacional como internacional.

La dirigente de Sumar se refirió al contexto político tras las elecciones autonómicas en Aragón, en las que el Partido Popular ganó en escaños pero perdió apoyos y seguirá dependiendo de Vox para gobernar. A partir de estos resultados, Díaz acusó al líder del PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, de haber convertido a su partido en una «maquinaria de engorde de Vox», al considerar que su estrategia política contribuye a fortalecer a la extrema derecha en lugar de aislarla.

Su abogado ha señalado que Maxwell estaría dispuesta a ofrecer información completa sobre las relaciones de Donald Trump y Bill Clinton con Epstein, siempre que se le conceda inmunidad penal. La comparecencia, que duró menos de una hora y se celebró a puerta cerrada, dejó sin respuesta las preguntas de los congresistas sobre la red de explotación sexual y los responsables involucrados.

Acudió primero al Centro de Salud de Guía de Isora, donde le indicaron que debía ser derivada al Hospital del Sur, situado a 25 kilómetros. Sin embargo, la ambulancia no llegó tras cuatro horas de espera, por lo que decidió trasladarse por sus propios medios. Una vez en el Hospital del Sur, los médicos determinaron que su dolencia no podía tratarse allí y requería traslado urgente al Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, en Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a más de 100 kilómetros de distancia. Tras esperar una hora y media por la ambulancia, la paciente murió durante el trayecto.

La Plataforma Pro Hospital Público del Sur de Tenerife ha denunciado este trágico suceso, que atribuye a las carencias estructurales y de recursos del Hospital del Sur (conocido como El Mojón), un centro que lleva décadas sin ampliación adecuada pese a las reivindicaciones vecinales durante más de 30 a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instituciones culturales europeas reclaman a la Comunidad de Madrid que reconsidere el recorte al Círculo de Bellas Artes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 72 instituciones culturales europeas, integradas en la European Alliance of Academies, han expresado públicamente su apoyo al Círculo de Bellas Artes (CBA) tras el drástico recorte de financiación anunciado por la Comunidad de Madrid. El Gobierno regional ha pasado de conceder una subvención anual de 250.000 euros a limitar la ayuda prevista para 2026 a apenas 12.500 euros, destinados por ahora a la tradicional lectura continuada de El Quijote. La Alianza considera que revertir esta decisión sería una forma clara de despejar las sospechas de que el recorte obedece a motivos ideológicos o políticos y de demostrar que la libertad artística no está en riesgo en la región.

Desde 1983, el CBA recibía una subvención nominativa que gestionaba con autonomía. En los últimos años esta ayuda se había mantenido estable en 250.000 euros, aunque en 2025 se redujo a 100.000 y se condicionó a la financiación de actividades concretas.

Durante estos eventos, un miembro de la CIA supuestamente tomaba notas detalladas de las conversaciones. Entre las personas cercanas a Epstein menciona al exprimer ministro israelí Ehud Barak, cuya presencia en la residencia de Epstein en Nueva York está documentada en fotografías y se enmarca en operaciones de inteligencia secretas.

Las señales, firmadas por las juventudes falangistas de España, mostraban la silueta de un hombre agrediendo a una mujer mayor, un mensaje considerado por las autoridades locales como una clara incitación al odio y al racismo.

La mayoría de los estados se han negado a entregar esta información sin procesar, lo que ha llevado al DOJ a demandar a más de 20 estados. Sin embargo, al menos 10 estados —con más de 37 millones de votantes registrados— han proporcionado sus listas completas, algunos firmando un 'memorando de entendimiento confidencial'.

El joven había solicitado al juzgado el embargo de la pensión de jubilación de su padre para continuar percibiendo una mensualidad de 482 euros, cantidad que representaba aproximadamente un tercio de los ingresos del progenitor.

El tribunal considera que el padre no tenía obligación legal de seguir abonando dicha pensión desde 2018, año en que falleció la madre del joven.

En cambio, el dirigente abertzale ha reafirmado su oferta de concurrir a unas elecciones generales junto al PNV mediante una candidatura conjunta basada en un programa de mínimos, con el objetivo de representar a la ciudadanía vasca 'como pueblo' y no simplemente como partido.

En declaraciones a la CNN, Oz reconoció que no todas las enfermedades afectan por igual a toda la población, pero insistió en que el sarampión es un caso claro en el que la vacunación es fundamental, especialmente para proteger a la infancia. Los brotes más recientes han afectado a cientos de personas en estados como Carolina del Sur, superando incluso cifras registradas en Texas en 2025, y se han detectado también casos en la frontera entre Utah y Arizona, además de otros estados.

Se destacan los fracasos estratégicos de Washington en conflictos clave como los de Líbano, Siria, Irak y Yemen, donde las acciones militares de EE.UU. no han logrado sus objetivos geopolíticos. En Líbáno, los ataques israelíes con apoyo estadounidense contra Hezbolá no destruyeron su capacidad de resistencia, sino que fortalecieron su posición. En Siria, las sanciones y bombardeos no impidieron la caída del gobierno de Assad ni el avance de grupos respaldados por Irán. En Irak, la expulsión de milicias proiraníes por el gobierno chiíta marcó un revés para la política exterior de Trump.

Alemany ha tratado de evitar un choque frontal con Rufián, enmarcando su iniciativa como un debate legítimo que interpela al conjunto de la organización, pero ha dejado claro que la estrategia republicana pasa por fortalecer “izquierdas nacionales enraizadas territorialmente” como respuesta al avance de la extrema derecha.

Esta cifra incluso supera los 273 millones que ya quedaron sin utilizar en 2024, lo que evidencia una baja ejecución sostenida en un área clave en un contexto de fuerte crisis de acceso a la vivienda en la región.

El contraste se produce al observar la evolución del gasto sanitario, donde sí se han aprobado ampliaciones de crédito. Entre ellas, destaca una inyección adicional de 25 millones de euros destinada a pagos a Quirón Salud. Este tipo de trasvases presupuestarios no es nuevo. En 2022, el Ejecutivo regional transfirió más de 191 millones de euros desde el remanente de tesorería de la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS) al Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS) para cubrir pagos por actividad asistencial realizada con medios privados.

Esta declaración surgió como respuesta a un comentario del comentarista conservador Matt Walsh, quien criticó un anuncio publicitario emitido durante la Super Bowl en el que varias mujeres, que afirmaron haber sido víctimas de Epstein y su círculo, pedían al fiscal general Pam Bondi que apoyara su causa y liberara más información. Walsh cuestionaba por qué estas mujeres no habían nombrado directamente a los responsables, sugiriendo que podrían hacerlo de forma protegida a través de congresistas o que su campaña parecía haber comenzado justo tras la salida de Joe Biden del poder.

Babiš señaló directamente al entonces primer ministro británico Boris Johnson como el principal responsable, afirmando que tras su visita a Kiev las negociaciones se descarrilaron y se perdió la oportunidad de poner fin rápido al conflicto.

El político checo también comentó que actualmente los esfuerzos diplomáticos para terminar la guerra se han intensificado, aunque considera que Europa por sí sola no podrá lograrlo. En su opinión, Donald Trump es un actor clave para alcanzar la paz, ya que sin su implicación no será posible establecer garantías de seguridad estables para Ucrania.

Meidner, judío alemán criado en un entorno liberal y asimilado, fue testigo directo del colapso de la democracia alemana y del ascenso del nazismo, incluyendo episodios clave como el incendio del Reichstag y la represión de la izquierda. Estas vivencias alimentaron en él una convicción duradera: el fascismo no era un accidente, sino una posibilidad real del capitalismo en crisis.

Tras huir a Suecia en 1933, Meidner se integró en un país gobernado por la socialdemocracia y desarrolló allí la mayor parte de su carrera como economista jefe de la Confederación Sueca de Sindicatos (LO). Desde ese puesto fue coautor del modelo Rehn-Meidner, que impulsó la política salarial solidaria para reducir desigualdades y fortalecer la cohesión de la clase trabajadora.

El show, seguido por millones de espectadores en todo el mundo, incluyó algunos de sus mayores éxitos y la participación de artistas invitados como Lady Gaga y Ricky Martin, lo que generó una amplia conversación en redes sociales y medios de comunicación.

Aunque una parte importante del público y de la crítica valoró positivamente la puesta en escena por su impacto global y su mensaje cultural, la actuación también despertó rechazo en determinados sectores.

La sentencia, ya firme, se basa principalmente en una prueba de ADN concluyente: los forenses hallaron saliva de la denunciante en el envoltorio del preservativo utilizado, lo que coincide con la versión del acusado de que fue ella quien lo abrió con la boca porque él estaba nervioso. Los jueces argumentan que 'ningún sentido tendría que la víctima facilitara al agresor la penetración' de esa forma, lo que considera incompatible con una violación.

Aunque el testimonio de la joven cumplía los requisitos para desvirtuar la presunción de inocencia y fue corroborado por amigas y policías (relató bloqueo y falta de consentimiento), el tribunal también valoró positivamente la declaración del acusado por su coherencia y claridad.

El contenido fue difundido como un mapa que mostraba el riesgo de rotura de presas, lo que generó preocupación y sensación de alarma entre parte de la audiencia. Sin embargo, la información contenida en el mapa no se correspondía con esa interpretación.

Según aclaró la Asociación Meteorológica del Sureste (AMETSE), el documento mostraba en realidad el riesgo potencial para la población en caso de una hipotética rotura, no la probabilidad real de que dichas presas fallaran. Es decir, el mapa señalaba aquellas infraestructuras cuya rotura, en el escenario más desfavorable posible, podría causar graves daños a núcleos urbanos, servicios esenciales o al medio ambiente.

El paro, convocado para los días 9, 10 y 11 de febrero, se produce tras los graves accidentes de Adamuz (Córdoba) y Gelida (Barcelona), que han dejado 47 víctimas mortales, y tiene como principal objetivo exigir mayores niveles de seguridad, mantenimiento de la red y refuerzo de personal.

El seguimiento está siendo elevado, sobre todo en Catalunya y el País Vasco, según los sindicatos. En el caso catalán, se han registrado incidencias adicionales por problemas en la aplicación de los servicios mínimos, que los representantes sindicales atribuyen a que Renfe comunicó tarde dichas obligaciones a los maquinistas. Esta situación ha agravado los problemas en la red de Rodalies, donde no se ha podido garantizar con normalidad el servicio previsto.

Esta alerta se produjo tras el estreno en Netflix de un documental sobre la desaparición de Madeleine McCann, en cuyo tercer episodio periodistas portugueses recordaban el escándalo de abusos sexuales a menores en la institución benéfica Casa Pia.

El correo electrónico, titulado 'Jeffrey Epstein', señala que, según los periodistas (incluida Felícia Cabrita), era un 'hecho conocido' que millonarios estadounidenses viajaban a Portugal en aviones privados para abusar sexualmente de niños de la Casa Pia, supuestamente con la connivencia de altos cargos de la institución desde los años 60.

Bruselas plantea que el recibo de la luz deje de utilizarse para financiar políticas ajenas al suministro eléctrico, eliminando conceptos no energéticos que actualmente se cargan en la factura, como determinados costes sociales o cánones.

El texto deja claro desde el inicio que no asume como verificados muchos de los hechos sugeridos en el vídeo y que el caso Epstein se utiliza más como metáfora de una corrupción sistémica que como un análisis jurídico riguroso.

El núcleo del discurso examinado presenta a las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas como un bloque homogéneo, coordinado y moralmente corrupto, enfrentado a una sociedad “normal”. Para ello, el vídeo recurre a metáforas como la “punta del iceberg”, a la insinuación constante de encubrimientos institucionales y a una ambigüedad estratégica que sugiere conexiones sin afirmarlas explícitamente. Esta forma de narrar permite mantener la sensación de misterio y conspiración sin comprometerse con afirmaciones verificables.

A pesar de adelantar los comicios con la intención de desgastar al PSOE, el resultado ha sido contrario a sus expectativas, con una pérdida de aproximadamente 13.000 votos respecto a las elecciones de 2023 y la caída de dos escaños, situándose en 26 diputados con un 34,27% de los votos. El descenso ha afectado especialmente a Zaragoza y Huesca, mientras que Teruel mantiene su representación. La extrema derecha, representada por Vox, ha crecido hasta casi el 18%, reforzando su capacidad de negociación para un posible pacto de gobierno. En las grandes ciudades aragonesas, el PP ha sufrido retrocesos significativos en porcentaje de voto en nueve de las diez principales urbes, destacando descensos de hasta el 10% en localidades como Calatayud.

Se destacan casos concretos de afectadas como Esther y María, quienes denunciaron cobros indebidos por servicios no prestados tras el cambio de Programa Individual de Atención o el fallecimiento de sus familiares.

España invierte en educación universitaria, pero su mercado laboral no absorbe a todos los titulados debido a salarios bajos, precariedad, elevado coste de la vida y escasa inversión en I+D (solo el 1,5 % del PIB frente al 2,2 % de media europea). Esto genera una 'trampa de desarrollo de talento' en regiones como Extremadura, Castilla y León o Castilla-La Mancha, que pierden población activa cualificada, lo que frena el crecimiento económico y debilita servicios públicos, creando un círculo vicioso. Aunque la fuga española es más interna (hacia Madrid y la costa) que externa, destinos como Alemania, Bélgica, Países Bajos e Italia atraen a muchos profesionales.

Nacido en Sevilla en 1960, fue guitarrista, cantaor y compositor, y uno de los principales impulsores de la fusión entre flamenco, rock y blues que marcó una ruptura estética y sonora a finales de los años setenta y durante la década de los ochenta.

Su trayectoria pública comenzó con el grupo Veneno, formado en 1977 junto a su hermano Raimundo Amador y Kiko Veneno. Aunque el único disco del grupo fue inicialmente incomprendido por crítica y público, con el tiempo se convirtió en una obra fundamental por su carácter innovador. Tras la disolución de Veneno, los tres músicos participaron en proyectos clave como el álbum “La leyenda del tiempo” de Camarón de la Isla, que supuso un punto de inflexión en el flamenco moderno.

La fotoperiodista italiana Valentina Sinis ha documentado esta realidad en su proyecto “Si las mujeres afganas desvelaran sus historias”, por el que ha sido finalista del premio Luis Valtueña. Sus imágenes y testimonios muestran cómo la exclusión femenina se ha normalizado hasta extremos cotidianos, como parques infantiles vacíos de niñas o calles donde las mujeres apenas pueden circular solas.

Las niñas afganas ya no pueden estudiar más allá de sexto grado y las mujeres tienen prohibido trabajar en la mayoría de sectores, acceder libremente a la atención sanitaria o compartir espacios con hombres fuera de su familia. Incluso se les veta la entrada a jardines públicos, símbolo de una expulsión deliberada del espacio común. Sinis relata que muchas familias desear]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-exclusion-sistematica-de-las-mujeres-en-afganistan-bajo-el-regimen-taliban-documentada-por-valentina-sinis</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-exclusion-sistematica-de-las-mujeres-en-afganistan-bajo-el-regimen-taliban-documentada-por-valentina-sinis</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cuba notifica a las aerolíneas un desabastecimiento general de combustible de aviación durante un mes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de Cuba ha comunicado a las aerolíneas internacionales que operan en la isla que, a partir del 10 de febrero, no dispondrá de combustible para aviación en ninguno de sus aeropuertos internacionales. La advertencia se ha emitido mediante un aviso oficial a navegantes (Notam), válido durante un mes, hasta el 11 de marzo, en el que se especifica que el combustible JET A1 no estará disponible. Esta situación afecta a todas las terminales internacionales del país, incluido el aeropuerto José Martí de La Habana, así como los de Varadero, Santiago de Cuba, Holguín, Camagüey, Santa Clara, Cienfuegos, Cayo Coco y Manzanillo.

Las aerolíneas más afectadas son principalmente compañías estadounidenses, españolas, panameñas y mexicanas, aunque por el momento ninguna ha detallado públicamente cómo adaptará sus operaciones. En crisis anteriores similares, las compañías lograron mantener los vuelos realizando escalas técnicas en países cercanos como México o República Dominicana para repos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuba-notifica-a-las-aerolineas-un-desabastecimiento-general-de-combustible-de-aviacion-durante-un-mes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/cuba-notifica-a-las-aerolineas-un-desabastecimiento-general-de-combustible-de-aviacion-durante-un-mes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gaby, Fofó y Miliki: del circo de posguerra al fenómeno televisivo en América y España]]></title><description><![CDATA[La historia de Gaby, Fofó y Miliki es la de una dinastía circense que atravesó la guerra, el exilio y la televisión para convertirse en uno de los mayores fenómenos culturales infantiles del mundo hispanohablante. Los hermanos Aragón Bermúdez debutaron en 1939, en plena posguerra española, cuando el país acababa de salir devastado de la Guerra Civil. Procedentes de una extensa familia de artistas de circo, asumieron desde el principio los roles clásicos del trío de payasos: Gaby como clown autoritario, Fofó como augusto bromista y Miliki como contra-augusto, papel que desempeñó desde niño.

La España franquista, empobrecida y represiva, ofrecía pocas oportunidades, por lo que en 1946 decidieron emigrar. Su salto decisivo fue Cuba, donde no solo actuaron en vivo, sino que entraron muy pronto en la televisión, un medio todavía incipiente en el mundo hispano. Desde La Habana, sus programas se exportaron a numerosos países y los convirtieron en figuras internacionales.

Ambas sufrían lesiones físicas, un profundo agotamiento y una sensación de extrañeza que no asociaban al consumo habitual de alcohol. Esa falta de memoria y la necesidad de comprender qué les había pasado las llevó a repetir el mismo recorrido de la noche de la agresión: los mismos bares, las mismas consumiciones y el mismo trayecto, con el objetivo de descartar que hubiera sido culpa suya o una mala decisión propia.

Durante ese proceso, preguntaron a personas cercanas y reflexionaron sobre su comportamiento habitual, concluyendo que nunca se habían marchado con desconocidos ni habían experimentado antes una situación similar. La reconstrucción, que terminó de madrugada sin incidentes, les confirmó que algo grave había ocurrido y reforzó la convicción de que habían sido ví]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-victimas-de-una-violacion-con-sumision-quimica-en-pamplona-relatan-como-reconstruyeron-los-hechos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-victimas-de-una-violacion-con-sumision-quimica-en-pamplona-relatan-como-reconstruyeron-los-hechos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sheinbaum defiende el apoyo a Cuba y busca vías diplomáticas para reanudar envíos de petróleo sin sanciones de EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de México, Claudia Sheinbaum, confirmó el 7 de febrero de 2026 que su gobierno continúa explorando vías diplomáticas para reanudar las ventas de petróleo a Cuba, interrumpidas en enero por Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) ante las amenazas del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump de imponer aranceles a los países que suministren crudo a la isla. Sheinbaum defendió el apoyo humanitario a Cuba y aseguró que la isla cumple con sus pagos contractuales, sin facturas pendientes. En 2025, las ventas alcanzaron casi 500 millones de dólares (496 millones según Pemex), representando menos del 1 % de la producción mexicana de crudo, combinando motivos humanitarios y comerciales. El director de Pemex, Víctor Rodríguez, destacó que existe un contrato vigente desde 2023 y que Cuba paga puntualmente. La suspensión de envíos coincidió con la crisis energética en Cuba tras la interrupción de suministros venezolanos (debido a la captura de Nicolás Maduro por fuerzas estadounidenses) y rusos. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/sheinbaum-defiende-el-apoyo-a-cuba-y-busca-vias-diplomaticas-para-reanudar-envios-de-petroleo-sin-sanciones-de-ee-uu</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[México envía 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba con buques de la Armada por instrucción de Sheinbaum]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Gobierno de México, bajo la dirección de la presidenta Claudia Sheinbaum, ha enviado más de 814 toneladas de ayuda humanitaria a Cuba. Dos buques de la Armada de México, el Papaloapan y el Isla Holbox, zarparon el 8 de febrero de 2026 desde el puerto de Veracruz con víveres destinados a la población civil de la isla. El buque Papaloapan transporta aproximadamente 536 toneladas de alimentos básicos como leche líquida, carne procesada, galletas, frijol, arroz, atún, sardinas, aceite vegetal y artículos de higiene personal. Por su parte, el Isla Holbox lleva más de 277 toneladas de leche en polvo. Esta operación responde a necesidades inmediatas de la población cubana y forma parte de la tradición solidaria de México con los pueblos de América Latina. La Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores informó que se preparan envíos adicionales, con más de 1.500 toneladas de leche en polvo y frijol pendientes de traslado en las próximas semanas.

Las víctimas vivían hacinadas en una pequeña habitación de solo 3,5 metros cuadrados en una vivienda de la Margen Derecha de Getxo, sin libertad de movimiento y bajo control constante. Estaban obligadas a ejercer la prostitución las 24 horas del día, con solo dos horas permitidas para salir de la casa, y debían permanecer siempre disponibles para atender a posibles clientes. Una de las detenidas las vigilaba presencialmente, mientras que una cámara de grabación con imagen y sonido instalada en la vivienda permitía el control permanente. Además, las tres mujeres debían entregar el 50 % de los ingresos obtenidos por sus servicios a las dos arrestadas.

Según fuentes citadas por EFE, el Ejecutivo cubano atribuye esta situación al endurecimiento de la presión energética por parte de Estados Unidos. En particular, a las recientes medidas anunciadas por la Administración estadounidense, que incluyen la amenaza de imponer aranceles a los países que suministren petróleo a Cuba y el fin del suministro procedente de Venezuela, hasta ahora uno de los principales proveedores de la isla.

El escrito solicitaba que la presidenta regional, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, rectificara y pidiera disculpas por unas declaraciones en las que defendía al cantante Julio Iglesias tras las denuncias por abuso sexual realizadas por varias extrabajadoras de su entorno.

La controversia se originó después de que Ayuso cuestionara públicamente una investigación periodística de elDiario.es que recogía testimonios detallados de mujeres que acusaban al artista de abusos. En un mensaje publicado en la red social X, la presidenta contrapuso esas denuncias con la situación de las mujeres en Irán, acusando a la izquierda de silencio cómplice y defendiendo la figura de Julio Iglesias como un símbolo cultural que, a su juicio, no debía ser desprestigiado.
