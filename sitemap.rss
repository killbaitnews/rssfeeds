Early in the morning, people gather outside distribution centers to receive essential food supplies as wages fail to cover basic living costs. Families that once managed on two incomes now struggle to pay rent and buy food, with inflation steadily eroding purchasing power. According to Capital Area Food Bank, over one-third of households in the region experienced hunger last year, including some with annual incomes of $90,000 to $120,000. Individuals like Shirleyann Desormeaux, a mother of four, and Salih Taylor, a government worker, are forced to rely on food banks despite having jobs. The rise in food insecurity is exacerbated by reduced government assistance, fewer food stamps, and cuts in subsidies for local organizations. As a result, both longtime residents and asylum seekers are increasingly seeking support from charities and church-run food distributions.

Since May, the DOJ has pursued these records from nearly every state, prompting widespread resistance. More than 20 states have refused and have been sued by the federal government, while at least 10 states—representing over 37 million registered voters—have complied, sometimes under so-called “confidential memoranda of understanding.”

According to the Brennan Center, these agreements reveal unprecedented federal ambitions to intervene directly in state-run election administration. The DOJ proposes to analyze state voter rolls itself and instruct states to remove specific voters within 45 days. This approach would upend long-standing election practices, as states, not the federal government, have legal authority and established]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/justice-department-seeks-state-voter-files-through-confidential-agreements-raising-legal-and-security-concerns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/justice-department-seeks-state-voter-files-through-confidential-agreements-raising-legal-and-security-concerns</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exploring the Vibrant 3D Designs of Lea Konaševská]]></title><description><![CDATA[Lea Konaševská’s design work stands out for its vivid use of color, playful forms, and subtle three-dimensionality. Her portfolio, especially visible on Dribbble, showcases a mastery of saturated colors, soft gradients, and sculptural forms that give a sense of being illuminated from within. Each piece, whether a product visualization or abstract artwork, balances boldness with precision, creating a sense of controlled vibrancy. Lipstick renders appear almost sculptural, and product visuals are treated as miniature stage sets. Even the most abstract creations have an underlying structure that enhances their visual impact. Konaševská's work demonstrates how graphic design can extend beyond flat visuals into a dynamic, spatial experience, blending digital technique with artistic sensibility. The article emphasizes her ability to make color behave unpredictably while maintaining compositional harmony, offering a refreshing perspective in contemporary design.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exploring-the-vibrant-3d-designs-of-lea-konasevska</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/exploring-the-vibrant-3d-designs-of-lea-konasevska</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 09:19:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NYPD Officer Sues Lil Tjay and Madison Square Garden Over Alleged Assault and Injuries]]></title><description><![CDATA[Rapper Lil Tjay is facing a civil lawsuit after an alleged altercation at a professional boxing event at Madison Square Garden left NYPD Officer John Przybyszewski with serious, permanent spinal injuries. According to court filings, the incident occurred at the Hulu Theater during a sold-out event promoted by Top Rank. Przybyszewski, who was part of a paid security detail, was instructed to remove Lil Tjay from the venue following reports of disruptive behavior. The complaint claims that Lil Tjay spat at a Madison Square Garden employee and that a physical confrontation ensued, resulting in severe cervical and lumbar spine injuries to the officer, including disc damage at the L4–L5 level. The officer alleges that the venue's insufficient staffing and lack of proper crowd control contributed to the escalation. Only two officers were present despite recommendations for at least eight.

Once overlooked and disorganised, the freezer is now presented as a quiet yet powerful tool that supports better meal planning, reduces food waste, and helps households adapt to busy schedules. With life moving at a fast pace, thoughtful freezer design is shown to contribute to calmer routines and more efficient kitchens.

Rather than simply keeping food frozen, today’s freezers enable families to cook in bulk, store seasonal produce, and preserve leftovers with ease. The article highlights how intuitive layouts, smooth-gliding drawers, and clearly defined compartments make daily interactions simpler and less stressful. These seemingly small design improvements reduce time spent searching for food and encourage better storage habits, which ultimately lead to a more organised home environment.

Customers are generally limited to purchasing nine cards per day, although some stores may allow more or fewer depending on local policies. These fee-free gift cards can be a useful way for credit card users to earn rewards points through spending at office supply stores. However, availability varies widely by location, and some shoppers report difficulties with certain cards, including pre-registered or previously used cards. Users have shared experiences of successfully using these cards for online and in-store purchases, while others caution that some merchants may require workarounds for PIN issues or partial payments. Staples has run similar promotions multiple times over the past few years, making this a recurring opportunity for shoppers and points enthusiasts.

Pond lighting serves both aesthetic and practical purposes. Strategically placed lights improve safety by highlighting pond edges and pathways, reducing the risk of accidents, and enhancing security by deterring intruders. Various lighting options are available: submersible lights offer an ethereal glow beneath the water, floating lights provide easy installation and can be solar-powered, while spotlights and uplights draw attention to specific features like waterfalls, fountains, or statues. Fibre optic lighting mimics starlight effects without electricity entering the water, and path lights illuminate walkways while contributing ambient light to the pond area. When choosing lighting, consider power sources such as low-voltage, solar, or traditional line voltage, along with color temperature, beam intensity, and durability for wet environments.

Speaking on Czech television channel TN.cz, Babiš stated that negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow in April 2022 were close to producing a peace agreement before they were abruptly derailed. According to him, the turning point came after a visit to Ukraine by then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom Babiš directly blamed for disrupting the negotiation process.

Babiš argued that the failure to conclude talks at that time eliminated the possibility of a rapid end to the conflict and prolonged the war. He did not provide documentary evidence for his claims but presented them as his political assessment of events during the early months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. His comments echo narratives previously promoted by Russian officials, who have repeatedly alleged that Western leaders discouraged]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/czech-prime-minister-says-external-intervention-undermined-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-in-2022</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/czech-prime-minister-says-external-intervention-undermined-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-in-2022</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chris Brown comments on Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX halftime performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Following Bad Bunny's energetic performance at the Super Bowl LX halftime show, Chris Brown took to Instagram to share his reaction, sparking widespread online discussion. The Puerto Rican artist delivered a high-energy set featuring hits like 'Monaco,' 'Yo Perreo Sola,' and 'Tití Me Preguntó,' captivating both the live audience and viewers worldwide. Celebrities such as Cardi B, Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba, and Karol G were seen enjoying and dancing along with the performance, adding extra star power to the event. Chris Brown's comment, 'I think it’s safe to say… they need me 😉,' led fans to debate whether he was joking, subtly criticizing, or hinting at a potential future Super Bowl performance. Brown’s name has been linked to Super Bowl halftime speculation before, with his manager previously expressing support for other artists taking the spotlight.

The author traces the emergence of this system from early Rome through the Middle and Late Republic, noting that prior to the 4th century B.C., Roman military equipment and tactics were heavily influenced by Greek and Italic practices. Archaeological and literary evidence suggests that key transitions—such as the adoption of the scutum, Montefortino helmets, La Tène-style swords, and the pilum—coincided with Rome's post-Gallic sack military reforms, centralizing the army and expanding recruitment. The pilum is highlighted as a particularly unusual weapon, heavier than standard javelins and designed with a long iron shank to penetrate shields and armor. Unlike lighter javelins, the pilum could maintain its momentum to potentially harm multiple ranks of enemy soldiers, and the bending of the shan]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-roman-infantry-tactics-and-the-role-of-the-pilum</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 05:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX Delays Mars Missions and Reorients Starship Program Toward the Moon]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article analyzes a major strategic shift by SpaceX following recent statements by Elon Musk confirming that Starship missions to Mars will not take place for at least five to seven years, effectively delaying any serious Martian effort until the early 2030s. This represents a dramatic departure from Musk’s long-standing narrative, in which Mars colonization was portrayed as an imminent and overriding priority. Instead, SpaceX will now focus its Starship program primarily on the Moon, aligning more closely with NASA’s Artemis program and U.S. geopolitical objectives in cislunar space.

According to the author, the shift is driven by practical constraints rather than visionary reassessment. SpaceX faces intense pressure to deliver an uncrewed lunar Human Landing System (HLS) mission by March 2027 in order to keep Artemis III on schedule for 2028. Achieving this requires rapid progress on complex technologies such as orbital propellant transfer, tanker Starships, and lunar-optimized v]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spacex-delays-mars-missions-and-reorients-starship-program-toward-the-moon</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spacex-delays-mars-missions-and-reorients-starship-program-toward-the-moon</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Andrew Tate dismisses reading, claiming he prefers thrill-seeking over books]]></title><description><![CDATA[Andrew Tate, a controversial social media influencer, recently stated in a resurfaced clip on X that he believes reading is for people with 'slow brains.' In the video, Tate claims his mind is 'too advanced' for books and that he prefers living a life full of chaos, adrenaline, and luxury. He emphasizes activities such as driving supercars, fighting, and partying as what gives him satisfaction, contrasting them with the supposed dullness of reading. The clip gained attention when shared by Alex & Books, a popular book-loving account, prompting reactions from viewers who mocked Tate’s statements and compared them to a child avoiding assigned reading. Experts, however, point out that research consistently shows reading enhances cognitive abilities, vocabulary, memory, and critical thinking. Psychologist Keith Stanovich has noted that engaging with books can contribute to higher intelligence.

The attack occurred in a residential building where multiple gunshots were reported. Alekseyev, 64, was struck several times and rushed to hospital in critical condition. According to the latest official information, he has since regained consciousness, although he remains under close medical observation.

Investigators state that surveillance cameras recorded a suspect leaving the scene wearing a long green hooded jacket and carrying a backpack. The suspect was later identified as Lubomir Korba, a native of Ukraine’s Ternopil region. Russian officials claim that Korba fled to the United Arab Emirates just hours after the attack. He was detained in Dubai by local authorities and subsequently handed over to Russia.

Loughborough, who previously led the Metropolitan Police's royalty and diplomatic protection unit, reportedly oversaw the decision to allow two officers to stay at Epstein's Manhattan townhouse while guarding Prince Andrew during a 2010 trip. Emails suggest Epstein personally offered accommodation for the officers, who were granted security access to the property. This occurred after Epstein had served an 18-month sentence for soliciting a minor. Additional records indicate that Prince Andrew also stayed at Epstein's Paris apartment while Epstein was under house arrest.

Since the 2014 coup, Ukraine has been a frontline state for NATO against Russia, receiving military support and diplomatic backing from Western countries, while suffering significant human and territorial losses. Recently, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz openly stated that Ukraine's EU membership in early 2027 is 'simply impossible,' emphasizing that all candidate countries must go through the strict Copenhagen criteria. This announcement underscores that no special path exists for Ukraine, and its extensive sacrifices will not be immediately rewarded. Economic concerns dominate EU leaders' minds, as integrating Ukraine with its destroyed infrastructure and high dependence on external aid could burden EU budgets.

Known as the “White Swan” due to its white exterior, the Tu-160 is presented as one of the most imposing bombers ever built, combining high speed, long range, and heavy payload capacity. Constructed from titanium, aluminum and steel alloys, and composite materials, the aircraft is capable of exceeding Mach 2 thanks to its four engines and variable-sweep wings.

According to the article, the Tu-160 can carry up to 45 tons of ordnance, including cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons, and nuclear warheads, making it a central component of Russia’s strategic deterrence. Its long endurance—exceeding ten hours and extendable through aerial refueling—allows it to conduct intercontinental missions. A recent patrol over the Arctic, closely monitored by NATO, is cited as an example of its continued operational relevance.

This article explains that travelers who temporarily fall short of requalification may still have options. If a loss of status was caused by an unusual or unavoidable change in travel patterns—such as a job change, medical issue, or new family responsibilities—it can be worthwhile to contact the loyalty program and request an extension.

The piece highlights reporting from View from the Wing, which notes that United Airlines has, in practice, offered elite status extensions once every five years to some members who fail to requalify, provided they proactively ask. This policy is not widely advertised, and customers generally must reach out directly to inquire.

According to the report, these companies do not directly participate in combat but provide essential infrastructure that enables military control, surveillance, and administrative governance of occupied areas.

The report argues that this corporate involvement represents a shift from what it calls an “economy of occupation” to an “economy of genocide,” alleging that commercial profits are increasingly intertwined with military actions that may constitute violations of international law.

The deal, finalized in September and awarded without competitive bidding, represents the largest known U.S. weapons purchase from an Israeli company in available federal records. It marks a reversal of the usual arms flow between the two countries, with the United States buying, rather than supplying, weapons to Israel.

Cluster munitions are widely criticized and banned by 112 countries under the Convention on Cluster Munitions due to their indiscriminate effects and the long-term danger posed by unexploded bomblets. While the United States, Israel, and several other major military powers have not signed the treaty, the U.S. adopted a policy in 2008 to phase out older cluster weapons and replace them with versions designed to have a failure, or “dud,” rate below 1 percen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-pentagon-signs-210-million-no-bid-deal-with-israeli-firm-for-new-cluster-munitions</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-pentagon-signs-210-million-no-bid-deal-with-israeli-firm-for-new-cluster-munitions</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukrainian Divers Target Oil Tanker Near Senegal's Coast in Sophisticated Attack]]></title><description><![CDATA[On November 27, 2025, four Ukrainian divers carried out a targeted attack on the Mersin oil tanker off the coast of Senegal. The tanker, which was anchored 19 kilometers from the Senegalese coast, was hit by underwater explosives, damaging its hull and causing water to flood its engine room. The tanker, owned by the Turkish Besiktas Shipping company, was flying the Panamanian flag but was part of Russia’s ‘phantom fleet.’ It had left Taman Port in Russia in August. The attack led to an extensive operation to prevent an oil spill, including deploying Senegal's ‘Plan Polmar,’ involving tugboats and rescue ships. The 22 crew members, mostly Turkish nationals, were evacuated. The explosions, which were attributed to Ukrainian intelligence by sources close to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense, involved Soviet-era limpet mines, and the attack marks the first of its kind in the Atlantic. The use of such sophisticated explosives shows a significant escalation in Ukraine’s naval tactics, previously]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukrainian-divers-target-oil-tanker-near-senegal-s-coast-in-sophisticated-attack</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ukrainian-divers-target-oil-tanker-near-senegal-s-coast-in-sophisticated-attack</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Concept for a Circular Rail Network Linking Major Northern Cities]]></title><description><![CDATA[A new visionary rail project, known as 'The Loop,' could change the way cities in the northern British Isles are connected. Proposed by Chris Williamson, the concept envisions a high-speed rail network that forms a continuous circle, linking cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin, and Bangor. Unlike traditional rail networks, which have fixed endpoints, The Loop offers a more fluid, circular connection, allowing cities to interact more like interconnected neighborhoods. This continuous, rhythmical system offers more than just practicality; it carries an emotional resonance, representing movement and relationship rather than a linear journey from point A to point B. This conceptual framework imagines a shared, ever-moving network where people, ideas, and cultures flow more freely. The idea reflects a deeper vision of mobility, one that emphasizes connection and circulation, inviting a rethinking of how cities can be linked not just ph]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-concept-for-a-circular-rail-network-linking-major-northern-cities</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/a-concept-for-a-circular-rail-network-linking-major-northern-cities</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 17:59:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin Focus on Lunar Missions Ahead of Artemis III]]></title><description><![CDATA[NASA's new interim administrator, Jared Isaacman, has emphasized prioritizing lunar landings over other space projects, aiming to maintain U.S. leadership in lunar exploration. The Artemis III mission, initially planned for 2024, has been delayed to 2028, contingent on SpaceX's HLS (Human Landing System) being ready. SpaceX faced setbacks with Starship in 2025, but Elon Musk has announced a temporary pause on Mars plans to focus on the Moon, with a non-crewed HLS test scheduled for March 2027. Meanwhile, Blue Origin is accelerating its lunar efforts with the development of the Blue Moon Mark 1.5 lander, designed for direct lunar missions without orbital refueling, potentially serving as a backup for Artemis IV if HLS is not ready. The Artemis III mission plan includes refueling the HLS from two depots, one in low Earth orbit and another in a high elliptical orbit, before docking with Orion to transport the crew to low lunar orbit.

It aims to show how scientists work in the cosmetic field, emphasizing that product development is grounded in evidence, safety, and rigorous validation rather than marketing alone.

The development of a new cosmetic begins with identifying a clear objective: defining the skin concern to address, the target consumer, and the expected benefits. Ideas may arise from market trends, unmet consumer needs, scientific evidence, or innovation in new ingredients developed through basic research. Once the objective is established, scientific literature is reviewed to select ingredients and technologies that best align with the intended mechanism of action.

The text discusses how the 2011 15M movement and the emergence of parties like Ciudadanos, VOX, and Podemos reflected the need for political renewal. Recent regional elections demonstrate a resurgence of local parties, such as Bloque Nacionalista Galego, Chunta Aragonesista, Por Ávila, and ¡Soria Ya!, challenging the traditional dominance of PSOE and PP.

Designed by Italian-Haitian fashion designer Stella Jean, each uniform was hand-painted by artisans and incorporated motifs reflecting Haiti’s history and heritage. Initially, the designs were to feature Toussaint Louverture, a Haitian revolutionary leader, inspired by artist Édouard Duval-Carrié. However, the International Olympic Committee prohibited political imagery, prompting a redesign that emphasized a symbolic red horse instead. These uniforms go beyond athletic apparel, serving as a moving canvas of identity and resilience. They represent Haiti’s artistic richness and national pride, bringing stories of struggle, beauty, and cultural strength onto the global stage.

While the Iranian government bears primary responsibility for suppressing dissent, criminalizing reform, and mismanaging the economy, the author contends that Western policies—especially those of the United States—have deliberately undermined the social forces most capable of producing peaceful change.

For more than two decades, many Iranians sought gradual reform through elections, civic mobilization, and support for reformist leaders. This strategy depended heavily on economic stability and the growth of a confident middle class, historically the engine of social and political change in Iran.

According to the records, the tip was sent to the FBI’s National Threat Operations Center and later forwarded internally, but Mark Epstein says no law enforcement agency ever contacted him to follow up.

Jeffrey Epstein died in August 2019 while awaiting trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but it has long been the subject of speculation and conspiracy theories. In his FBI submission, Mark Epstein asserted that his brother was killed because he was 'about to name names,' and claimed to believe Trump was responsible.

Rather than allowing the NSA to circulate the intelligence report through normal channels, Gabbard allegedly took a physical copy directly to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles. The following day, Gabbard reportedly instructed the NSA not to formally publish the report and instead required that all information be transmitted solely to her office.

Deception Island is an active volcanic caldera shaped like a horseshoe and home to vast colonies of chinstrap penguins, seals, and numerous seabird species. Human presence there is rare and limited mainly to scientists, historians, and tourists who visit during the Antarctic summer.

Despite its isolation, the island bears traces of intense human activity throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Seal hunters nearly exterminated local seal populations in the early 1800s, followed decades later by large-scale whaling operations that left behind industrial structures. During World War II, the United Kingdom established Station B on the island to prevent Nazi naval use, constructing buildings such as aircraft hangars, many of which still stand today.

The presentation highlighted tangible progress that makes the system more usable and relevant than in previous years, particularly in areas where Hurd has historically lagged behind Linux and other modern kernels.

One of the most notable achievements is the near-completion of the x86_64 port. For many years, GNU Hurd was largely limited to 32-bit x86 systems, which severely constrained its practicality on modern hardware. With 64-bit support now essentially complete, Hurd can better target contemporary PCs and servers. In addition, there are early discussions and interest in extending support to AArch64, which would further broaden its hardware reach.

According to the report, starting on February 10, 2026, eligible cardmembers—including those with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire Preferred, Chase Sapphire Reserve for Business, and J.P. Morgan Reserve—will be able to directly buy tickets through a special access link. This offer is notable because it is not a lottery-based system; instead, tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis while supplies last.

The ticket sales window is expected to run from February 10 through February 24, 2026, though availability may end earlier due to limited inventory. Only Category 1 and Category 2 seats will be offered, which historically have been among the most expensive options. With FIFA’s use of dynamic pricing, prices are expected to reflect market demand rather than discounted or fixed rates.

Amazon saw its valuation drop by $200 billion in a single session, with shares falling more than 9%. Microsoft suffered its largest one-day decline in over five years, losing roughly $357 billion after announcing record AI investments alongside slower growth in its cloud business. Similarly, Alphabet and Nvidia each lost over $100 billion in market capitalization, reflecting concerns about whether the massive AI spending will translate into profits. Despite these setbacks, investments in AI are projected to increase by 50% this year. Analysts warn that while AI has potential, the enormous capital expenditures required for building large data centers and integrating AI into products create significant financial risks. The developments underscore growing market skepticism about the profitability of AI-focused vent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/major-tech-stocks-decline-amid-rising-ai-investment-costs</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/major-tech-stocks-decline-amid-rising-ai-investment-costs</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 18:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Voter Expresses Regret Over Support Amid Controversies and Policy Criticism]]></title><description><![CDATA[As dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump grows, some of his supporters are publicly expressing regret. One voter from New Mexico, identified only as 'John,' called C-SPAN's 'Washington Journal' to apologize for supporting Trump in three consecutive elections. He criticized the president for posting a racist video on Truth Social featuring former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, calling it embarrassing and dishonorable. John also condemned Trump's relationships with corporate leaders, alleged corruption, and harsh immigration enforcement policies, including raids targeting children and schools. Public frustration with Trump extends beyond isolated incidents, reflected in polling showing Americans are unhappy with his authoritarian tendencies, handling of the economy, and focus on conspiracy theories rather than domestic issues. Recent political events, such as a Democrat winning a deep-red Texas Senate seat previously endorsed by Trump, highlight growing Republican conce]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-voter-expresses-regret-over-support-amid-controversies-and-policy-criticism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-voter-expresses-regret-over-support-amid-controversies-and-policy-criticism</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 16:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Travelers Are Earning American Airlines Status and Navigating Credit Card Changes in 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[This Week in Review from Frequent Miler focuses on how loyalty programs and credit card strategies are evolving in 2026, with particular attention to American Airlines AAdvantage. The article opens with a discussion of modern “mileage running,” explaining how elite status can now be earned without flying. Since American Airlines awards Loyalty Points for credit card spending, shopping portals, hotel bookings, and other partnerships, travelers close to an elite threshold can finish qualifying from home. The author describes using AAdvantage Shopping and tax payments on credit cards to bridge the gap between Gold and Platinum status, while also clarifying timing rules around February transactions and statement closing dates.

A major theme is the upcoming transition of Barclays-issued American Airlines Aviator cards to Citi American Airlines cards in April 2026.

Rather than focusing on travel rewards or credit cards, the piece curates stories that are striking, ironic, or emotionally compelling.

The first story centers on a large-scale fraud involving helicopter rescue operations in Nepal. Because trekking at high altitudes is dangerous, hikers are typically required to have insurance that covers emergency rescues, which are common and extremely costly. According to the article, several travel and rescue executives allegedly exploited this system by submitting fabricated rescue claims. These claims reportedly included fake hospital documents, medical invoices, and cargo manifests. Authorities arrested six executives, with one company accused of filing 171 fraudulent claims out of more than 1,200 submissions, leading to over $10 million in illegitimate insurance payouts.

In a recent episode of her podcast, Reclaiming with Monica Lewinsky, she spoke with actress Jameela Jamil about the lingering fear and anxiety stemming from the intense public scrutiny she experienced. Lewinsky explained that although she has made progress in healing and has become more confident in her identity, the fear of losing everything she has built remains a constant presence. She described moments of vulnerability, feeling as though the trauma from the past could resurface at any time and threaten her sense of purpose and stability. Despite these challenges, Lewinsky emphasized her efforts to stay grounded in the present and focus on what she has now rather than what happened decades ago. The conversation highlighted not only the personal struggle Lewinsky has faced but also the resilience required to navigate]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-lewinsky-reflects-on-the-lasting-emotional-impact-of-the-1998-clinton-scandal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-lewinsky-reflects-on-the-lasting-emotional-impact-of-the-1998-clinton-scandal</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 08:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[U.S. Trade Deficit and the Impact of Tariffs on Imports]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses recent trends in the U.S. trade deficit, illustrated with graphs from WolfStreet. It highlights that the temporary spike in the deficit was largely due to U.S. importers stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. While the tariffs have indeed discouraged imports, the article argues that a significant portion of the adjustment in the trade balance, particularly with Europe, is influenced by broader geopolitical events. The post controversially suggests that the war in Ukraine has had economic repercussions that affected trade flows.

The Naasan family exemplifies this crisis: they have been forcibly uprooted twice from their ancestral lands in the Jordan Valley due to violent attacks by Israeli settlers and military forces. Settler raids, home demolitions, and systemic harassment continue to target Palestinian communities, particularly Bedouin villages in Area C, leading to widespread displacement. Since October 2023, tens of thousands of Palestinians have been internally displaced, including over 30,000 from refugee camps during large-scale military operations. The displacement is accompanied by property destruction, killing of livestock, and direct threats to civilians. Experts describe these actions as deliberate demographic engineering, supported by Israeli government funding and quasi-governmental organizations]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/state-supported-displacement-of-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-intensifies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/state-supported-displacement-of-palestinians-in-the-west-bank-intensifies</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 07:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Overview of French Comics Artist Serge Pellé and His Science Fiction Work on Orbital]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article from the Lines and Colors blog presents an overview of the work of French comics artist Serge Pellé, best known for his contributions to the science fiction comic series 'Orbital,' created in collaboration with writer Sylvain Runberg. The post situates Pellé within the contemporary European comics scene, emphasizing his distinctive visual style and his ability to construct dramatic, immersive futuristic environments.

Pellé’s artwork is characterized by expansive science fiction settings rendered with deep perspective and a high level of architectural and mechanical detail. The article highlights his talent for depicting large-scale futuristic structures, imaginative spacecraft, and alien creatures, all enhanced by intense lighting and dynamic compositions.

The burial pit was found just south of the Iron Age hillfort at Wandlebury and contains the remains of up to ten young men. The site is located in what was once a volatile frontier zone between the Saxon kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia, an area frequently contested during the early Viking presence in England.

The grave is striking for the chaotic and violent nature of the burial. It includes at least four complete skeletons that appear to have been bound at the time of burial, with dismembered body parts—such as stacked legs, scattered limbs, and a pile of skulls—thrown on top of them. While only limited evidence of combat injuries has been identified, including a single skull with chop marks consistent with decapitation, the overall arrangement suggests extreme viole]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/viking-age-mass-grave-near-cambridge-reveals-trepanned-skull-of-exceptionally-tall-young-man</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 06:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games Store Offers Two Free Games This Week]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epic Games Store continues its tradition of offering free games to its users, doubling the number of free titles compared to the previous week.

Relations between South Africa and Washington have cooled due to political disagreements, South Africa’s positions on sensitive international issues, and its participation in alliances such as BRICS, which challenge U.S. global influence. As a result, the United States has threatened South Africa’s trade privileges and imposed tariffs on key exports, negatively affecting an economy already vulnerable to global instability.

In response, South Africa has accelerated a strategy aimed at reducing its dependence on the U.S. market while diversifying its trade partnerships. China has emerged as a central player in this shift. Beijing has decided to grant tariff-free access to specific South African products, offering immediate relief to exporters harmed by U.S. tariffs.

U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns had initially blocked her deportation and recommended that she be issued a student visa to return to the U.S. However, federal prosecutors argue that the Secretary of State does not have the legal authority to grant visas unilaterally. The government further noted that if Lopez Belloza returned, she would still be subject to immediate detention and removal under a final deportation order. ICE confirmed that while they considered returning her to the status quo prior to her removal, they have decided against it. Lopez Belloza, who had no criminal record, expressed that her deportation felt unjust, as she had been focused on her studies and had secured significant financial aid to attend college.

From the title, the article appears to address renewed scrutiny surrounding the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and how alleged associations, documents, or revelations connected to him may have political consequences in the United Kingdom. Specifically, it suggests that the controversy could pose a serious threat to the sitting UK prime minister, either by damaging public trust, intensifying political opposition, or triggering internal party unrest.

In pieces like 'Going Green,' a sports car in the desert evolves into a miniature ecosystem, while 'Brooklyn Brownstone' reimagines New York’s facades as vertical gardens with climbing vines and blooming morning glories. 'Angels Gate' incorporates a basketball court into this botanical transformation, merging rigid geometry with organic forms. The series also references art history, as seen in a floral reinterpretation of Vermeer’s 'Girl with a Pearl Earring,' where petals replace paint to suggest the freedom of imagination beyond historical constraints.

The one-minute clip, posted on Thursday evening, primarily focused on repeating false claims about alleged irregularities in the 2020 presidential election, particularly questioning President Joe Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania. Near the end of the video, at the 59-second mark, an AI-generated image appeared showing Barack Obama’s face superimposed on a monkey’s body, accompanied by the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.”

The post quickly drew criticism across social media platforms, with many users and public figures denouncing it as racist and offensive.

This development comes after months of escalating trade tensions, where U.S. punitive tariffs were imposed to pressure India into aligning its energy policy with American priorities. By agreeing to redirect its energy imports to other countries, particularly the U.S. and Venezuela, India has shifted from its longstanding strategy of diversified energy sourcing and cost prioritization. The move highlights the influence of economic leverage in international relations, signaling that access to major markets often requires political concessions. While India maintains some strategic autonomy, the decision underscores the limits of neutrality when faced with the economic power of a global hegemon. For emerging economies, this case demonstrates that maintaining a neutral position in global energy politics can come with high costs and strategic constrain]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/india-agrees-to-end-russian-oil-imports-following-u-s-trade-pressure</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 20:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical Continuity of State-Sanctioned Violence from the KKK to ICE]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article draws a historical parallel between the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), framing both as instruments of state terror designed to divide and control the working class. The KKK emerged after the U.S. Civil War to maintain white supremacy and social order through terror, targeting Black citizens and preventing interracial labor solidarity. The article argues that the KKK’s racial violence was not mere fanaticism but a calculated political tool tolerated or supported by authorities, evolving over time from clandestine operations to infiltrating government structures. ICE, created in 2003 under the Department of Homeland Security, is portrayed as a modern continuation of this model, enforcing xenophobic and anti-labor policies under legal authority. Through practices such as dawn raids, arbitrary arrests, family separations, and detention centers, ICE creates a climate of fear aimed at disciplining the broader U.S. working class.

Contrary to the simplified narratives often presented in popular culture, the story reveals the complex and uncomfortable realities of power, oppression, and survival in the American South. During the early nineteenth century, several Native American nations of the Southeast, including the Cherokee, adopted aspects of European-American culture in an effort to avoid displacement. This process of so-called “civilization” included plantation agriculture and the enslavement of Black people.

After the forced removal known as the Trail of Tears, wealthy Cherokee elites rebuilt their plantation economy in Indian Territory, bringing enslaved people with them.

Washington has demanded such access since 2022 under what it calls Enhanced Border Security Partnerships (EBSP), linking data-sharing arrangements to continued participation in the US Visa Waiver Program.

It references statements made over 20 years ago by climatologist Mojib Latif, who predicted that Germany would no longer experience harsh winters due to global warming, noting that recent severe winter conditions contradict those predictions. The text criticizes climate models like ERA5 and datasets such as HadCRUT for relying on indirect measurements and statistical estimations rather than actual, continuous temperature recordings. The author argues that temperature databases are adjusted over time, sometimes retroactively, to fit prevailing climate narratives, highlighting past controversies including the 2009 East Anglia emails that suggested manipulation of climate records. The article emphasizes that missing measurements in remote areas or over the ocean are filled with proxies, creating an abstraction rather than a direct represent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discussion-on-january-temperature-drops-and-climate-data-reliability</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/discussion-on-january-temperature-drops-and-climate-data-reliability</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 18:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former Canadian military chief raises debate on nuclear deterrence amid strained U.S.–Canada relations]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports on a controversial debate sparked in Canada following remarks by retired General Wayne Eyre, who served as Chief of the Defence Staff from 2021 to 2024. Speaking at a conference at Ottawa’s Rideau Club, Eyre argued that Canada would never achieve true strategic independence without its own nuclear deterrent. He claimed that Canada possesses many of the prerequisites for such a program, including a strong civilian nuclear industry, scientific expertise, and significant uranium reserves, which rank among the largest in the world.

Eyre emphasized that he was not necessarily calling for the immediate development of nuclear weapons, but rather for keeping all strategic options open. He suggested investing in delivery technologies, particularly in aerospace and missile capabilities, so that Canada could act quickly if future circumstances demanded it. According to Eyre, these steps would provide strategic coverage in an increasingly unstable global environment.

Montreal boasts around 70 international organizations, including six UN offices and NATO’s Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence, as well as significant experience in aerospace, finance, defense, and technology sectors. The initiative has received support from key local and provincial political figures, including Quebec’s Prime Minister François Legault, Montreal Mayor Soraya Martínez Ferrada, and Minister of International Affairs Christopher Skeete, as well as other political leaders.

This offer was especially valuable, prompting many cardholders to plan significant spending as soon as their cards became active.

However, reports surfaced indicating that the 5x promotion was not properly attached to all accounts that cardholders believed were eligible.

Instead of traditional in-ear earbuds, Slac consists of a circular ear ring paired with a wrist component, both of which resemble contemporary jewelry more than audio devices. The ear ring wraps gently around the ear without entering the ear canal, allowing users to remain aware of conversations, traffic, and environmental sounds while listening to music or other audio content.

A key feature of the design is its modular, case-free approach. When not in use, the ear ring magnetically attaches to the wrist piece, transforming into a bracelet-like form. This eliminates the need for a separate charging or storage case and reinforces the idea that the product is meant to be worn continuously, like jewelry. The aesthetic is deliberate and sculptural, with black and metallic finishes that give the device enough visual ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/samsung-slac-concept-reimagines-earbuds-as-wearable-jewelry</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/samsung-slac-concept-reimagines-earbuds-as-wearable-jewelry</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 08:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[New DOJ records raise unresolved questions about activity near Jeffrey Epstein’s jail cell before his death]]></title><description><![CDATA[Newly released Department of Justice documents have revived questions about the circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s death in a federal jail in August 2019, focusing on unexplained activity near his cell hours before he was found dead. Surveillance video logs reviewed by investigators describe an orange-colored figure ascending the staircase to Epstein’s isolated housing tier at approximately 10:39 p.m. the night before his body was discovered. This observation appears to contradict repeated official statements that no one entered the tier that night.

The records show that different investigative bodies interpreted the same blurry video footage in conflicting ways. FBI reviewers suggested the figure could have been an inmate wearing an orange prison uniform, while the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General concluded it was an unidentified corrections officer possibly carrying orange linen or bedding.

Unlike many video game adaptations that retell existing stories, the Baldur’s Gate series will serve as a direct continuation of the game’s narrative, taking place immediately after the events of Baldur’s Gate 3. The story will explore the consequences of the game’s ending while introducing new protagonists who must navigate a world shaped by the actions of powerful, established characters.

The series is being produced in collaboration with Hasbro Entertainment, with additional executive producers including Jacqueline Lesko, Cecil O’Connor, and Hasbro’s Gabriel Marano.

These cardholders were told that their cards would remain with Barclays instead of transferring to Citi.

Because Barclays will no longer be permitted to issue American Airlines–branded cards, affected accounts will be product-changed into other Barclays cards. Personal Aviator Red and Silver cards are being converted into the Barclays Arrival Plus Mastercard, while Aviator Business cards are being converted into the Barclays Juniper Business Mastercard.

Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on social media that the group has 'lost its way' since its 2025 rebrand to promote inclusivity, deviating from 'core values' aligned with 'God and country.'

Unlike conventional bridges where roads go over water, this aqueduct allows a road to pass underneath a waterway. Boats can travel smoothly across the shallow channel on top while cars drive below without interruption. This design eliminates the need for drawbridges, tall structures, or any waiting times for passing vessels, creating a seamless flow of both road and water traffic. The structure highlights a minimalist and efficient engineering approach, characteristic of Dutch design thinking, where water is integrated into infrastructure rather than treated as an obstacle. Its clever design initially causes a mental double-take, as viewers instinctively perceive water above a road as impossible. Yet, this innovative solution demonstrates practicality, reduced mechanical complexity, and a visually clean environment.

Following Canada’s recent approval for Chinese cars, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) has voiced deep concerns. CEO Mike Stanton warned that allowing Chinese vehicles could be detrimental to the U.S. automotive industry, consumers, and the country’s economic interests. While some members of Congress, such as Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, reportedly support resisting Chinese imports, there is bipartisan acknowledgment of the challenges posed by the direct-to-consumer sales model favored by Chinese manufacturers. Analysts suggest that the resistance from NADA is largely tied to the existing dealership franchise system, which Chinese automakers might bypass by selling directly to consumers and offering lower prices.

The discussion breaks down key aspects such as earning rates on everyday spending, standard airline perks like free checked bags and priority boarding, and whether those benefits meaningfully offset the annual fee. A significant portion of the episode is dedicated to lounge access policies, elite-status-related perks, and how each card supports travelers who are chasing or maintaining airline status.

At the same time, it acknowledges that alternative explanations exist, with some outlets suggesting the satellite may have broken apart due to an accidental collision with space debris rather than a deliberate military strike.

The Olymp/Luch satellites, launched beginning in 2014, have long drawn attention from Western governments because of what they describe as unusual behavior.

This approach, the article argues, makes a genuine peace agreement impossible and instead serves a political objective: prolonging the conflict while portraying Russia as inherently hostile to peace.

A central argument is that European and US proposals assume from the outset that Russia would violate any future agreement. On that basis, Western actors emphasize the need for so-called security guarantees for Ukraine.

However, critics argue the measure is largely ineffective and poses serious risks to privacy and civil liberties. Social media companies prioritize advertising revenue over user well-being, designing platforms to maximize engagement, often to the detriment of mental health. Measures like hiding 'likes' could reduce harm without restricting access, but governments often avoid these less disruptive alternatives due to economic interests. Prohibiting access entirely can hinder freedom of expression, access to information, and social development, especially for marginalized groups or individuals with dissident sexual and gender identities.

Although the crash itself did not initially appear severe, the vehicle’s battery was apparently punctured, triggering a fire less than a minute after impact.

The video shows the driver exiting the car quickly but being unable to open the rear door because the retractable door handles failed to deploy. Moments later, even the driver’s own door became inoperable. Within 29 seconds, smoke filled the cabin, trapping three passengers inside as all doors remained shut.

Using real flight examples, the article evaluates the value of Frontier miles across different fare bundles, including Basic, Economy, Premium, and Business. The analysis shows that mile value can vary widely, ranging from well under one cent per mile to more than two cents, depending on route, fare class, and cash pricing. Generally, cheaper cash fares produce lower redemption value, while higher fare bundles can offer more attractive returns.

The promotion is available from February 5 through February 22, 2026, but may end earlier if Frontier distributes its total allocation of 70 million promotional miles. Based on the maximum award of 5,000 miles per person, participation is effectively capped at around 14,000 members.

To qualify, participants must already have miles or points in another airline’s legitimate loyalty program. Instead of transferring or forfeiting those miles, members simply submit a screenshot proving they hold miles in another program, along with a form provided by Frontier. Frontier then awards a matching number of Travel Miles on a one-to-one basis, subject to specific thresholds. Submissions under 1,000 miles receive a minimum of 1,000 Frontier miles, while submissions above that amount are matched up to a maximum of 5,000 m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/frontier-airlines-offers-up-to-5-000-bonus-miles-through-limited-time-mileage-match-promotion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Europe's rearmament]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this video, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez discusses the evolving security landscape in Europe, particularly focusing on the need for increased defense spending and cooperation among European nations in light of geopolitical tensions.

On January 21, eight Palestinian men, including Maher Awad and Sameer Isam Aziz Zeidan, were transported shackled from Arizona to Tel Aviv, with refueling stops in New Jersey, Ireland, and Bulgaria. They were handed over to Israeli authorities at Ben Gurion Airport and dropped at a West Bank checkpoint near Ni’lin, where locals assisted them. A second similar flight occurred on February 1 (or Monday that week).

Gates, 70, denied these claims in an interview with Australian channel 9News, calling them 'false' and speculating that Epstein may have been trying to defame him. He clarified that he never visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island and did not engage in any sexual relationships. Gates explained that his interactions with Epstein in 2011 were primarily focused on potential investments in scientific ventures, but he now views the meetings as a mistake. 

Melinda French Gates, in an NPR interview, criticized her ex-husband’s friendship with Epstein and alluded to 'muck' during their 27-year marriage, emphasizing the pain it brought her.

Unlike most research that focuses on adolescents, this investigation analyzed data from 26,362 participants aged 40 to 77 using the UK Biobank. The study found that moderate cannabis usage was generally associated with larger volumes in several brain regions, particularly those with high cannabinoid receptor density, and better performance in cognitive tasks such as learning, memory, attention, processing speed, and executive function. Interestingly, while most regions showed positive associations, the posterior cingulate area displayed lower volume in high-use participants, highlighting the complexity of cannabis effects. Sex differences were observed, with nuanced interactions suggesting the endocannabinoid system functions differently in men and women.

Speaking Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press,” Khanna argued that the disclosure does not meet the public’s demand for accountability and warned that further congressional action could follow if all remaining files are not released.

According to Khanna, the Justice Department identified more than 6 million documents connected to the Epstein case but released only about 3 to 3.5 million after review and redactions. Although he acknowledged that the newly disclosed records were substantial and troubling, he emphasized that they represent only roughly half of the total materials collected.

Many report entire crews vanishing overnight due to fears of detention or deportation, leaving crops like carrots unharvested and valued at nearly $1 million in some cases. This threatens contract fulfillment, potential legal actions, and even bankruptcy for affected producers, as experienced manual labor cannot be easily replaced. The issue extends beyond fields to meat and livestock processing plants, where worker shortages could slow production, reduce supply, and increase nationwide consumer prices. Compounding these challenges are persistent trade disruptions, including lost export markets to China for soybeans and wheat, resulting in excess supply, depressed prices, and weakened long-term trade relationships despite temporary aid promises.

Josh Hawley criticizes Netflix’s transgender representation during antitrust hearing]]></title><description><![CDATA[During a U.S. Senate antitrust hearing examining Netflix’s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming assets, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched a pointed critique of the company’s inclusion of transgender and LGBTQ+ characters, particularly in content accessible to children. Hawley alleged that Netflix promotes what he described as a “transgender ideology,” claiming—without evidence—that nearly half of its children’s programming advances such an agenda. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos firmly rejected the assertion, stating that the figures were inaccurate and that he had no idea where they originated.

Hawley appeared to rely on claims from the conservative advocacy group Concerned Women for America, which previously asserted that 41% of certain children’s-rated Netflix series contain LGBTQ+ content. Critics note that this framing conflates all LGBTQ+ representation with transgender themes and reflects the group’s ideological bias.

The base is located near Petrozavodsk, the regional capital, only a few dozen kilometers from Finnish territory, making it strategically significant.

In recent weeks, the site has undergone rapid changes. New infrastructure has been built, military equipment has been transported in, and terrain preparation work has intensified. Areas that were previously forested have been cleared, the land has been leveled, and military trucks have begun rotating through the base.

Estimated to be over 4,800 years old, this remarkable tree has been alive since before the construction of the Great Pyramids of Egypt, quietly enduring vast stretches of human and natural history. Its age and resilience have made it a powerful symbol of longevity and survival in extreme environments.

Methuselah was identified in the 1950s by Edmund Schulman, a dendrochronologist from the University of Arizona, who studied tree rings to understand past climates. Through careful analysis, Schulman determined that this particular bristlecone pine was thousands of years old. To protect it from vandalism and excessive human impact, its precise location within the White Mountains is kept secret.

Carbonell described the strategic approach as shifting the burden of combat to others while managing the risks of escalation.

This area contained graves of dozens of Allied soldiers, primarily Australians, but also British and Polish personnel from World War II, as well as British soldiers from World War I. The destruction involved removal of gravestones, churning of topsoil, and creation of earth berms, suggesting use of heavy equipment for systematic earthworks rather than incidental bomb damage seen elsewhere around the site. Jaradah reported two operations: one clearing olive trees outside the walls and another inside affecting about 1,000 square meters, including Australian graves and areas near a memorial and visitor bench, occurring around late April or early May after Israeli withdrawal from the zone. The IDF stated the area was an active combat zone where terror]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/satellite-imagery-and-witness-accounts-reveal-damage-by-israeli-forces-to-section-of-gaza-war-cemetery-containing-allied-wwi-and-wwii-graves</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/satellite-imagery-and-witness-accounts-reveal-damage-by-israeli-forces-to-section-of-gaza-war-cemetery-containing-allied-wwi-and-wwii-graves</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 22:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Targeting SLU7 Protein Shows Promise in Reducing Tumor Growth and Enhancing Immune Response in Preclinical Cancer Models]]></title><description><![CDATA[Researchers at the Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA) at the University of Navarra, led by Dr. Carmen Berasain and Dr. María Arechederra, have published a study demonstrating that the protein SLU7 plays a critical role in maintaining the survival of cancer cells, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), cholangiocarcinoma, and colon cancer. Previous work showed that SLU7 levels decrease during liver disease progression, contributing to cellular dedifferentiation and genomic instability, yet a residual amount remains essential for tumor cell viability in advanced stages. In this new research, conducted as part of Carla Rojo's doctoral thesis and published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, the team tested multiple strategies to silence or reduce SLU7 expression in established tumors using inducible CRISPR/Cas9, shRNAs, siRNA delivered via magnetic nanoparticles, and aptamer-conjugated siRNA for targeted delivery.

Speaking on the We Need to Talk podcast on February 3, Kerr reflected on the realization that staying together was no longer healthy for either of them. She explained that both she and Bloom acknowledged their relationship was not bringing out the best in them, which ultimately led to their decision to separate in 2013 after six years together.

Central to their post-divorce dynamic was a promise Kerr made to Bloom: to always put Flynn’s needs first. Now 15 years old, Flynn became the guiding focus as they navigated the challenges of life after their breakup. Kerr emphasized that building a respectful coparenting relationship required significant emotional work, patience, and intention from both sides.

This work, housed at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is a tempera and oil on panel piece depicting Saint Anthony the Great being tormented and lifted into the air by a group of grotesque demons. It is based on a 15th-century engraving by the German artist Martin Schongauer titled Saint Anthony Tormented by Demons, but the young Michelangelo transformed it by adding vibrant colors, enhanced textures, and atmospheric depth. According to historical accounts from Giorgio Vasari and Ascanio Condivi—Michelangelo's early biographers—the artist studied real fish specimens at the market to accurately render the scaly, animal-like features of the demons, making them more lifelike and compact than in the original engraving.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Vance was asked whether he would apologize for previously labeling Pretti an “assassin” who showed up to an ICE protest with “ill intent.” Vance responded dismissively with the question, “For what?”, and maintained that his statements were justified, despite evidence that Pretti had been disarmed before being fatally shot by federal agents.

The piece explains that Vance amplified a social media post from a senior White House official on the day of the killing, portraying Pretti as a would-be attacker of federal officers. According to the article, this framing quickly became part of a broader right-wing narrative that cast Pretti as a dangerous domestic threat rather than a civilian protester.

Epstein persistently sought meetings through intermediaries, notably Thorbjørn Jagland, former Norwegian Prime Minister and Council of Europe Secretary General, proposing discussions on Western investment in Russia, economic solutions, geopolitics, or private dinners. Emails show Epstein following up over years, sometimes referencing current events like the MH17 crash to adjust timing, but there is no evidence of any positive response from Russian authorities, no direct communication with Putin, no meetings, and no Kremlin involvement. The Kremlin has denied receiving any such offers.

This uncertainty arises amid public scrutiny of their friendship, which has cooled significantly. The strain intensified after Lively's legal dispute with It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni led to the unsealing of private text messages between Swift and Lively in court documents.

START had long been a cornerstone of global nuclear stability, limiting each country to 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads and establishing verification mechanisms such as mutual inspections and data exchanges.

It argues that machines, like buildings or tools, are shaped by assumptions about wear, stress, and repeated use. Rather than treating wear as a failure, the text frames it as an expected and measurable result of sustained operation. Polished surfaces, compressed seals, and shifting tolerances are presented as records of work performed, not signs of neglect.

A central theme is that thoughtful design anticipates where and how wear will occur. Engineers decide which components absorb stress and which remain stable, allowing systems to age in controlled and predictable ways. Longevity, therefore, depends less on preventing change and more on managing it within acceptable boundaries. This perspective shifts attention from avoiding wear to designing systems that can be adjusted, repaired, and realigned over time.

These pieces evoke a strong sense of nostalgia for an era that never fully materialized in the way retro-futurism once imagined, blending the ordinary with the extraordinary to pull viewers into dreamlike, otherworldly moments. The works draw heavily from 1960s photo album aesthetics, grounding the fantastical elements in recognizable, everyday Americana while placing them in impossible cosmic settings. This contrast immediately disrupts the ordinary and sparks wonder.

His comments immediately triggered widespread concern and criticism from legal experts, politicians, and members of the public, who warned that such actions would amount to voter intimidation and a serious violation of democratic norms.

Just days after the Brexit referendum on June 23, 2016, Epstein emailed tech billionaire Peter Thiel on June 26, stating 'Brexit, just the beginning.' When Thiel asked 'Of what,' Epstein replied it signaled a 'return to tribalism, counter to globalisation, amazing new alliances.'

According to the author, Trump publicly shared a screenshot of a private conversation with Macron, an act described as an unprecedented breach of diplomatic discretion. The author argues that the true scandal is not the indiscretion itself, but the lack of substantive media coverage about the content of the exchange.

The piece claims that the conversation implicitly confirms close coordination between the United States and France regarding military and political actions in Syria, contradicting what the author portrays as the dominant media narrative of a purely internal, popular uprising against dictatorship. From this premise, the author expands the argument to suggest that Syria has already been dest]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-opinionated-critique-of-western-power-politics-and-media-silence-on-syria-and-iran</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/an-opinionated-critique-of-western-power-politics-and-media-silence-on-syria-and-iran</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 03:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Earn 25,000 Bonus Points on Your First Homes & Villas by Marriott Booking]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marriott Bonvoy is offering a promotion for first-time bookings through its Homes & Villas platform, allowing members to earn 25,000 bonus points on their first stay.

Speaking on the program Nostalgia Tonight with Joe Sibilia, Jones described a marriage that evolved significantly over time but remained emotionally connected even after it ended. Jim and Jane met while studying puppetry at the University of Maryland and married in 1959, forming both a romantic partnership and the foundation of what would become the Muppets empire.

According to Jones, their early bond was intense and genuine, with Jane playing a critical role in Jim’s creative beginnings. She collaborated closely with him on early projects such as Sam and Friends and was deeply involved in shaping his artistic vision. However, as Jim’s career accelerated and the Muppets became a global success, their relationship dynamic shifted.

Although the discounted purchase price is higher than Frequent Miler’s estimated reasonable redemption value for Marriott points, the deal can still make sense in specific scenarios. It is particularly useful for travelers who need a small number of additional points to complete an award booking or who can secure high-value redemptions where points are worth more than one cent each.

According to statements attributed to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, investigators believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her home against her will rather than leaving voluntarily. She was last seen on Sunday, February 1, and concerns escalated after law enforcement processed the scene at her residence.

Officials stated that evidence found at the home suggested signs of forced removal, leading them to believe the incident may have occurred during the night while she was asleep. A spokesperson for the sheriff’s department said investigators do not believe she left on her own and emphasized that her limited mobility makes it unlikely she could have walked away without assistance. The circumstances, they said, point to a possible kidnapping or abduction.

The unit was originally set to retire at the end of 2025 due to air pollution regulations, but a mechanical failure and a December order from the administration extended its operation. The Energy Department has defended the move, citing an 'energy emergency' and the need for reliable baseload power.

During his opening monologue, Stewart explained that he reviewed the files, like many public figures and members of the public, to see whether he was mentioned. He framed the situation with humor while also providing context about how and why his name appeared.

According to Stewart, the reference comes from a 2015 email sent by Epstein to producer Barry Josephson. In the email, Epstein suggested an idea for a hypothetical stand-up project involving filmmaker Woody Allen, proposing that it could be distributed through platforms such as Apple TV or Amazon. Josephson replied by outlining a possible format for the project, describing it as a biographical event that could be hosted or narrated by “somebody like Jon Stewart,” or alternatively voiced over by Allen himself.

Designed in 1927, approved in 1930, and revised in 1935, the plan remained classified until 1974 and reflected interwar strategic thinking rather than an imminent intention to attack Canada. The plan assumed that the United States would quickly neutralize British forces and occupy key Canadian cities, including Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa, to prevent Britain from using Canada as a staging ground.

According to the article, the plan included detailed operational elements such as seizing ports, disrupting infrastructure, and rapidly occupying population centers.

French authorities are encouraging the adoption of European-developed alternatives that comply more closely with EU data protection rules, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Rather than treating buildings as sealed, static objects, breathing spaces are designed as dynamic frameworks that interact continuously with nature and human presence. From the moment one enters such a space, subtle elements—shifting daylight, gentle airflow, softened boundaries between indoors and outdoors—create a sense of calm and vitality.

Central to this approach is the rejection of over-containment. Designers prioritize orientation, openness, and the strategic use of natural light as a core material. Daylight is allowed to define rhythm and mood throughout the day, while shadows, reflections, and transparency are embraced instead of tightly controlled. Openings such as large glazed doors, sliding panels, and folding systems become active architectural elements, enabling cross-ventilation, visua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/architecture-that-responds-to-light-air-and-human-experience</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 08:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Diplomatic Talks Temporarily Delay U.S. Military Action Against Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[Diplomatic efforts between the United States and Iran have led to a temporary postponement of any potential U.S. military strike on Iran.

Feeling protected goes beyond physical safety to include emotional reassurance through stable, predictable environments that allow the nervous system to relax, improving focus and decision-making. Key qualities include clear organization, visual balance, supportive boundaries, and comforting sensory elements like lighting, sound, and texture.

Grounding connects people to the present and their surroundings via natural materials (wood, stone, fabrics), nature-inspired colors, natural light, and outdoor views, reducing anxiety and enhancing belonging.

The test, which simulates fueling and countdown procedures up to T-20 seconds, involved loading approximately 987 tons of cryogenic propellants into the SLS core stage (144 tons of liquid hydrogen and 840 tons of liquid oxygen) and additional propellant into the ICPS upper stage. Although the tanks were successfully filled for the first time in this campaign—a significant improvement over Artemis I—the test was halted multiple times due to persistent hydrogen leaks at the tail service mast umbilicals (TSMU), the same quick-disconnect interfaces at the base of the core stage that caused repeated delays in 2022.

The article argues that France’s Third Republic (1870–1940), often celebrated as a milestone of democratic freedoms and civic rights, simultaneously consolidated a brutal and explicitly racist colonial system. While republican liberties, secular education, and parliamentary life flourished within metropolitan France, the empire was governed through coercion, legal discrimination, and permanent states of exception.

Poch details how colonial domination was codified through mechanisms such as the Code de l’Indigénat, which denied basic rights to colonized populations and institutionalized forced labor, collective punishment, and racial hierarchy. Prominent republican figures like Jules Ferry embodied this contradiction, defending universal education]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-s-colonial-legacy-and-the-contradictions-of-republican-universalism</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/france-s-colonial-legacy-and-the-contradictions-of-republican-universalism</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:50:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU Military Assistance Plans Risk Escalation as the War in Ukraine Deepens]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article argues that the European Union is moving toward a dangerously escalatory path in its approach to the war in Ukraine. It focuses on proposals by Manfred Weber, leader of the European People’s Party, to strengthen and operationalize Article 42.7 of the EU Treaty, the mutual assistance clause that obliges member states to provide aid, including military support, in the event of an attack. According to the author, making this clause more concrete could significantly lower the threshold for EU involvement in armed conflict, especially if Ukraine joins the EU as planned in early 2027 while hostilities with Russia continue.

The text warns that such a move could rapidly draw the EU into war, not only through Ukraine but also through potential flashpoints in the Baltic states or other sensitive regions. It suggests that this may be an intentional strategy to use the assistance clause as a de facto European security guarantee for Eastern Europe, with some voices even proposing Ukrai]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-military-assistance-plans-risk-escalation-as-the-war-in-ukraine-deepens</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-military-assistance-plans-risk-escalation-as-the-war-in-ukraine-deepens</guid><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 20:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un grupo protesta contra el alto coste de la vida en Canadá robando y repartiendo alimentos]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un grupo autodenominado “Los Robin de los Callejones” protagonizó una acción de protesta en Montreal al asaltar una tienda de comestibles, robar alimentos y repartirlos posteriormente en refrigeradores comunitarios. Vestidos como el personaje de Robin Hood, los participantes aseguraron que su objetivo no era el beneficio personal, sino llamar la atención sobre el fuerte aumento del coste de la vida en Canadá, especialmente el encarecimiento de los productos básicos.

Según explicaron, la acción tuvo un carácter político y simbólico, al considerar que muchas familias no pueden afrontar el precio actual de los alimentos en un contexto de inflación persistente. El reparto se realizó en puntos de acceso comunitario, utilizados habitualmente por personas con dificultades económicas, lo que refuerza el mensaje de denuncia social que el grupo quiso transmitir.

Aunque no existe evidencia de un vínculo formal entre Epstein y la organización, su mención en los mensajes evidencia cómo Friends of Israel opera dentro de un circuito de poder global, articulado a través de reuniones privadas, consejos de dirección y financiamiento de grandes empresarios, como Robert Agostinelli. Fundada en 2010 tras la salida de Aznar de la política activa, Friends of Israel se centra en defender la legitimidad de Israel y su derecho a la autodefensa, pero funciona como un lobby político con mínima transparencia y sin rendición de cuentas públicas.

Estas medidas bloquean la importación de petróleo desde cualquier país y se enmarcan dentro de un histórico embargo económico que se mantiene desde 1962. La situación se agrava por la intervención militar estadounidense en Venezuela, que ha cortado el suministro de crudo que Cuba recibía desde ese país, su principal proveedor. México, otro de sus abastecedores, también ha suspendido envíos debido a la presión de Washington. La falta de combustible ha generado apagones prolongados, problemas en el suministro de agua, transporte limitado y ajustes en la educación y la jornada laboral.

Elon Musk ha confirmado que la empresa no enviará una misión Starship a Marte en los próximos cinco a siete años, retrasando así cualquier intento de colonización marciana hasta, como mínimo, 2031-2033. Este retraso responde a varios factores, entre ellos la necesidad de centrarse en la Luna, donde SpaceX busca construir una ciudad lunar antes de 2036, lo que considera más viable en un plazo de diez años debido a la cercanía del satélite y la posibilidad de asegurar la supervivencia de los colonos. Además, la NASA, bajo la dirección de Jared Isaacman, impulsa la carrera lunar frente a China, lo que aumenta la presión sobre SpaceX para desarrollar el HLS (Human Landing System) y los sistemas de repostaje en órbita necesarios para Artemisa III en 2028.

El contexto del caso se vincula a la denuncia de una exconcejala de Móstoles, que ha relatado episodios de acoso sexual y laboral por parte del alcalde del municipio.

Según el análisis, si estas formaciones concurrieran unidas a las elecciones generales, superarían el efecto penalizador del sistema D’Hondt y las barreras provinciales que en 2023 les dejaron en solo 45 escaños pese a sumar unos 4 millones de votos.

Se plantean tres escenarios: en el conservador (Escenario A), manteniendo los votos de 2023, obtendrían entre 55 y 59 escaños, convirtiéndose en tercera fuerza. Con una movilización moderada del 10-12 % adicional (Escenario B), llegarían a 61-68 escaños, y con una fuerte movilización del 20 % (Escenario C), alcanzarían 70-75 escaños. Este crecimiento se concentraría especialmente en Andalucía, Comunidad Valenciana, Madrid y otras regiones.

En tono de broma, Pérez se dirige al animal preguntándole si es del PSOE, una ocurrencia que pretendía resultar graciosa pero que terminó generando la reacción contraria a la esperada.

El perro, lejos de mostrarse tranquilo, reacciona de forma brusca y está a punto de morder al político, obligando a su dueña a intervenir rápidamente. El incidente no pasó a mayores, pero sí dio material de sobra para que las redes sociales hicieran su particular lectura del suceso.

Chan School of Public Health, con seguimiento de 18 años a casi 32.000 hombres y publicado en European Urology, indica que eyacular 21 o más veces al mes se asocia con un riesgo aproximadamente un 20 % menor de desarrollar la enfermedad, especialmente en tumores de bajo riesgo, posiblemente por la eliminación de sustancias potencialmente cancerígenas. Este beneficio se enmarca en seis medidas clave con evidencia científica: 1) Alimentación rica en frutas, verduras, grasas saludables (omega-3) y evitar ultraprocesados, carnes procesadas o cocinadas a altas temperaturas; 2) Ejercicio regular y control del peso para reducir inflamación y obesidad, ligada a formas más agresivas; 3) No fumar, y]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/habitos-saludables-para-prevenir-el-cancer-de-prostata-alimentacion-ejercicio-no-fumar-y-eyaculacion-frecuente-segun-estudios-cientificos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/habitos-saludables-para-prevenir-el-cancer-de-prostata-alimentacion-ejercicio-no-fumar-y-eyaculacion-frecuente-segun-estudios-cientificos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 13:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Residente de Colmenar Viejo denuncia la mala calidad de los menús en la residencia tras huelga de hambre]]></title><description><![CDATA[Marcelo Marko, residente de la residencia de mayores de Colmenar Viejo, permaneció 25 días en huelga de hambre para protestar por la calidad y cantidad de los alimentos que se sirven en el centro, gestionado por la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS).

Las instrucciones incluyen rechazar verbalmente cualquier solicitud de permiso de abordaje por parte de fuerzas iraníes, pero no resistirse por la fuerza si se produce un embarque. Esta medida responde a incidentes previos en los que Irán ha incautado buques extranjeros alegando violaciones como contrabando.

Este martes se celebra una nueva cita judicial en la que comparecen Carlos Mur, Francisco Javier Martínez Peromingo y Pablo Busca Ostalaza, responsables de la firma e implementación de estos documentos, en calidad de imputados. Quirós reclama que se haga público el papel de Isabel Díaz Ayuso y del exconsejero de Sanidad Enrique Ossorio, denunciando que se ha intentado encubrir responsabilidades.

Nicholas Carlini, investigador de Anthropic, ha mostrado cómo el modelo Claude Opus 4.6, mediante un sistema de agentes trabajando en paralelo, ha sido capaz de generar un compilador de C completo en solo dos semanas y con un coste aproximado de 20.000 dólares. Este proyecto, denominado Claude's C Compiler (CCC), consta de 100.000 líneas de código en Rust y permite compilar un kernel Linux 6.9 funcional en arquitecturas x86, ARM y RISC-V. Comparativamente, desarrollar un compilador tradicional podía implicar inversiones millonarias y años de trabajo de múltiples ingenieros.

Sin embargo, hacia el final de la semana este chorro se volverá más sinuoso, permitiendo la entrada de aire mucho más frío desde latitudes árticas. Este cambio estará reforzado por el desplazamiento de la dorsal anticiclónica hacia el sur de las Azores y la profundización de una baja en el entorno de Italia, lo que intensificará los vientos de componente norte y noroeste sobre la Península.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el congresista republicano Ted Hill, elimina la excepción que en versiones anteriores permitía izar la ikurriña en contextos culturales, como el festival Jaialdi de Boise, que celebra la profunda presencia histórica de la diáspora vasca en la región.

El origen del conflicto se sitúa en la decisión del Ayuntamiento de Boise, gobernado por la demócrata Lauren McLean, de mantener la bandera del Orgullo Progresivo más allá del mes del Orgullo. En respuesta, el Capitolio de Idaho aprobó en 2023 una ley que limitaba las enseñas autorizadas en edificios gubernamentales. Para sortear esa restricción, Boise declaró la bandera LGTBIQ+ como oficial de la ciudad, lo que provocó una nueva reacción legislativa por parte de los republicanos estatales.

Los implicados eran trabajadores de empresas subcontratadas para el mantenimiento de las vías del tren, lo que les permitía acceder fácilmente al material y a los recursos necesarios.

La actividad delictiva se inició a finales de 2024 y consistía en la sustracción de cableado de cobre, tramos de vía, tornillería y otros elementos de las infraestructuras ferroviarias, principalmente en el tramo entre Vinaròs y Torreblanca. El material robado, que ascendió a más de 30 toneladas, era posteriormente vendido en centros de tratamiento de residuos de la zona, obteniendo beneficios superiores a los 15.000 euros.

La investigación comenzó tras una denuncia por un robo con fuerza en la zona de obras de la estación de Vinaròs y se prolongó durante más de cuatro meses.

El anuncio, lanzado en diciembre de 2025, utiliza el humor y la sátira para explicar de forma clara y accesible los argumentos oficiales que justifican la medida, así como sus posibles contradicciones y efectos secundarios.

El vídeo presenta la prohibición como una respuesta política a la creciente preocupación social por el impacto de las redes en la salud mental de niños y adolescentes, incluyendo problemas como la ansiedad, el acoso digital, la adicción a las pantallas o la exposición a contenidos nocivos. A través de un tono irónico, el anuncio expone cómo el Gobierno defiende la iniciativa como una forma de “proteger a los menores”, mientras evita abordar cuestiones estructurales como la falta de regulación efectiva de las grandes plataformas tecnológicas o ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-video-satirico-analiza-la-prohibicion-de-las-redes-sociales-a-menores-de-16-anos-en-australia</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 08:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bad Bunny agradece al equipo de Zara en Arteixo su colaboración en el vestuario de la Super Bowl]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los trabajadores de la sede central de Inditex en Arteixo, A Coruña, recibieron un inesperado reconocimiento por parte de Bad Bunny tras su actuación en el descanso de la Super Bowl 2026.

El autor parte de los datos de inejecución de los Presupuestos de la Comunidad Autónoma, que superan los 2.300 millones de euros en los dos primeros años de legislatura, a los que se suman la posible pérdida de unos 500 millones procedentes de los fondos europeos del Mecanismo de Recuperación y Resiliencia. Estos datos, señala, resultan especialmente graves en un territorio que arrastra carencias estructurales en ámbitos clave como la vivienda, la sanidad, la educación o el nivel salarial, y donde el coste de la vida es de los más altos del Estado.

Según datos de Eurostat, la proporción de población que vive en viviendas con menos habitaciones de las necesarias ha pasado del 4,7% en 2018 al 9,1% en 2024, lo que supone un incremento cercano al 94% en solo seis años. Este aumento contrasta con la evolución media del conjunto de la UE, donde el hacinamiento ha descendido ligeramente en el mismo periodo.

El fenómeno está estrechamente ligado al encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y de la compra de vivienda, que obliga a muchas familias a reducir espacio y privacidad para poder acceder a un techo. Aunque España no se sitúa entre los países con mayores tasas absolutas —muy por debajo de algunos Estados del este de Europa—, sí destaca por la intensidad del crecimiento, solo comparable al caso de Irlanda.

El obturador mecánico, basado en cortinillas físicas, sigue siendo muy utilizado por su fiabilidad en todo tipo de condiciones de iluminación, su compatibilidad con el flash y su capacidad para capturar escenas con movimientos rápidos sin distorsiones. Sin embargo, presenta limitaciones como el ruido, las vibraciones y velocidades máximas más reducidas.

Este éxodo, uno de los episodios más trágicos de la Guerra Civil, dejó entre 3.000 y 5.000 víctimas civiles, en su mayoría mujeres, niños y ancianos, que fueron bombardeados por mar y aire durante el camino.

Pese a que el cine español ha tratado la Guerra Civil en más de un centenar de películas, ninguna había reflejado hasta ahora este episodio concreto. Arijo, que ha investigado a fondo la filmografía sobre el conflicto, considera que existía una deuda narrativa con la Desbandá. Su motivación es también personal: relatos familiares, como el de una tía de su padre que vivió aquella huida siendo niña, le hicieron tomar conciencia del sufrimiento cotidiano y silencioso que marcó a toda una generación.

El objeto, de apenas 63 milímetros de longitud y unos 1,5 gramos de peso, data del cuarto milenio antes de nuestra era y adelanta en más de dos milenios el uso fiable de la perforación rotatoria en Egipto.

Durante décadas, la pieza fue catalogada de forma imprecisa como una simple lezna de cobre, siguiendo una descripción escueta realizada en los años veinte por el arqueólogo Guy Brunton. Sin embargo, un nuevo reanálisis mediante microscopía ha revelado patrones de desgaste incompatibles con un uso por presión o percusión.

Aunque históricamente fue un pez muy abundante y presente en casi toda la península ibérica, la anguila ha perdido más del 80 % de su distribución original. El colapso más grave se produjo a partir de los años ochenta, coincidiendo con una intensificación de su explotación comercial, especialmente tras el declive de la anguila japonesa. Según Clavero, la pesca es el principal factor que impide la recuperación de la especie, por encima de otros argumentos habituales como la contaminación de las agua]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-investigador-del-csic-pide-una-veda-total-y-prolongada-para-evitar-la-extincion-de-la-anguila-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-investigador-del-csic-pide-una-veda-total-y-prolongada-para-evitar-la-extincion-de-la-anguila-europea</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 22:30:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discord implementa verificación de edad global: cuentas en modo 'adolescente' por defecto a partir de marzo]]></title><description><![CDATA[Discord ha anunciado el despliegue global de su sistema de verificación de edad a partir de marzo de 2026.

La dirigente de Sumar se refirió al contexto político tras las elecciones autonómicas en Aragón, en las que el Partido Popular ganó en escaños pero perdió apoyos y seguirá dependiendo de Vox para gobernar. A partir de estos resultados, Díaz acusó al líder del PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, de haber convertido a su partido en una «maquinaria de engorde de Vox», al considerar que su estrategia política contribuye a fortalecer a la extrema derecha en lugar de aislarla.

Una vez en el Hospital del Sur, los médicos determinaron que su dolencia no podía tratarse allí y requería traslado urgente al Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, en Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a más de 100 kilómetros de distancia. Tras esperar una hora y media por la ambulancia, la paciente murió durante el trayecto.

La Plataforma Pro Hospital Público del Sur de Tenerife ha denunciado este trágico suceso, que atribuye a las carencias estructurales y de recursos del Hospital del Sur (conocido como El Mojón), un centro que lleva décadas sin ampliación adecuada pese a las reivindicaciones vecinales durante más de 30 a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mujer-de-38-anos-fallece-camino-al-hospital-de-la-candelaria-tras-demoras-en-traslados-por-deficiencias-en-el-hospital-del-sur-de-tenerife</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 21:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instituciones culturales europeas reclaman a la Comunidad de Madrid que reconsidere el recorte al Círculo de Bellas Artes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un total de 72 instituciones culturales europeas, integradas en la European Alliance of Academies, han expresado públicamente su apoyo al Círculo de Bellas Artes (CBA) tras el drástico recorte de financiación anunciado por la Comunidad de Madrid. El Gobierno regional ha pasado de conceder una subvención anual de 250.000 euros a limitar la ayuda prevista para 2026 a apenas 12.500 euros, destinados por ahora a la tradicional lectura continuada de El Quijote. La Alianza considera que revertir esta decisión sería una forma clara de despejar las sospechas de que el recorte obedece a motivos ideológicos o políticos y de demostrar que la libertad artística no está en riesgo en la región.

Desde 1983, el CBA recibía una subvención nominativa que gestionaba con autonomía. En los últimos años esta ayuda se había mantenido estable en 250.000 euros, aunque en 2025 se redujo a 100.000 y se condicionó a la financiación de actividades concretas.

El giro en su postura se produce tras conocerse el último escrito de la Fiscalía, que solicita la absolución del acusado al considerar que los hechos no constituyen delito, pese a que previamente había sostenido lo contrario.

Mouliaá ha expresado públicamente su indignación por lo que califica como una contradicción grave del Ministerio Público. En un mensaje difundido en la red social X, cuestiona que la Fiscalía pasara de acusar a Errejón a defender su absolución tras el procesamiento judicial, señalando que este cambio de criterio genera desconfianza. Según la actriz, esta situación la ha llevado a reafirmarse en su decisión de llegar “hasta el final” del procedimiento.

La Fiscalía solicita para él una pena de seis años y medio de prisión por cohecho, prevaricación administrativa y malversación de caudales públicos, además de una multa de 29.000 euros. Junto a Benavent también están acusados cuatro empresarios, para los que se piden penas de entre tres y cinco años de cárcel.

Durante su declaración, en la que únicamente ha respondido a las preguntas de su abogado, Benavent ha marcado distancias con lo que afirmó en fase de instrucción. Ha asegurado que no suscribe aquellas declaraciones porque, según él mismo ha reconocido, las realizó estando “muy fumado de marihuana”.

El joven había solicitado al juzgado el embargo de la pensión de jubilación de su padre para continuar percibiendo una mensualidad de 482 euros, cantidad que representaba aproximadamente un tercio de los ingresos del progenitor.

El tribunal considera que el padre no tenía obligación legal de seguir abonando dicha pensión desde 2018, año en que falleció la madre del joven. La pensión se había fijado inicialmente en una sentencia de medidas paternofiliales a favor de la madre como progenitora custodio tras la separación de la pareja en 2015. Tras el fallecimiento de esta, la obligación de alimentos en ese procedimiento quedó extinguida, por lo que el pago posterior realizado por el padre fue voluntario y no exigible legalmente.

En declaraciones a la CNN, Oz reconoció que no todas las enfermedades afectan por igual a toda la población, pero insistió en que el sarampión es un caso claro en el que la vacunación es fundamental, especialmente para proteger a la infancia. Los brotes más recientes han afectado a cientos de personas en estados como Carolina del Sur, superando incluso cifras registradas en Texas en 2025, y se han detectado también casos en la frontera entre Utah y Arizona, además de otros estados.

En Líbáno, los ataques israelíes con apoyo estadounidense contra Hezbolá no destruyeron su capacidad de resistencia, sino que fortalecieron su posición. En Siria, las sanciones y bombardeos no impidieron la caída del gobierno de Assad ni el avance de grupos respaldados por Irán. En Irak, la expulsión de milicias proiraníes por el gobierno chiíta marcó un revés para la política exterior de Trump.

Esta cifra incluso supera los 273 millones que ya quedaron sin utilizar en 2024, lo que evidencia una baja ejecución sostenida en un área clave en un contexto de fuerte crisis de acceso a la vivienda en la región.

El contraste se produce al observar la evolución del gasto sanitario, donde sí se han aprobado ampliaciones de crédito. Entre ellas, destaca una inyección adicional de 25 millones de euros destinada a pagos a Quirón Salud. Este tipo de trasvases presupuestarios no es nuevo. En 2022, el Ejecutivo regional transfirió más de 191 millones de euros desde el remanente de tesorería de la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS) al Servicio Madrileño de Salud (SERMAS) para cubrir pagos por actividad asistencial realizada con medios privados.

Los cuatro pequeños clones de los protagonistas (Minichess, Minicas, Cuasimov y Minilem), que habían entrado a explorar, son expulsados muertos y desnudos, lo que genera alarma y sospechas de que el urbionte devora esencias o almas, dejando solo carcasas. Lem interpreta las nuevas pequeñas estructuras surgidas alrededor como túmulos o mausoleos, mientras que otros personajes buscan interpretaciones menos siniestras. Finalmente, del domoide emerge un gato antropomorfo de más de un metro de altura, con ojos brillantes, que se presenta como]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tetra-el-gato-antropomorfo-emerge-del-urbionte-en-la-taberna-flotante</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/tetra-el-gato-antropomorfo-emerge-del-urbionte-en-la-taberna-flotante</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 15:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Agresión homófoba contra el árbitro Pascal Kaiser tras pedir matrimonio a su pareja en un estadio de la Bundesliga]]></title><description><![CDATA[El árbitro alemán Pascal Kaiser ha denunciado haber sido víctima de una agresión física en el jardín de su domicilio, apenas una semana después de protagonizar un gesto histórico en el fútbol profesional: pedir matrimonio a su novio, Moritz, ante más de 40.000 espectadores durante un partido de la Bundesliga entre el FC Köln y el Wolfsburgo. El episodio, ampliamente difundido en redes sociales, convirtió a Kaiser en un referente de visibilidad LGTBI dentro de un deporte tradicionalmente marcado por el silencio y la invisibilidad en torno a la diversidad sexual.

Según ha relatado el propio árbitro y ha recogido el diario deportivo francés L’Équipe, los días posteriores a la pedida estuvieron marcados por amenazas explícitas que incluían la dirección exacta de su vivienda. Kaiser trasladó estas amenazas a la policía, que le comunicó que no existía un riesgo inmediato.

El autor rechaza de forma contundente la idea de que 'todos perdimos la guerra', argumentando que se trata de una manipulación revisionista que equipara a los golpistas franquistas con los defensores legítimos de la II República. Subraya que los vencedores (el bando franquista) disfrutaron de privilegios, poder y celebración de la victoria durante décadas, mientras que los perdedores sufrieron represión, campos de concentración, ejecuciones, exilio y estigmatización social y económica.

El detonante inmediato fue el cese de Marcos Francoy, asesor del partido en las Cortes de Aragón, tras difundirse mensajes racistas, antisemitas y de exaltación fascista en sus redes sociales. Aunque Vox intentó inicialmente desvincularse alegando que se trataba de opiniones personales, la presión mediática y política forzó su destitución, provocando además tensiones en el gobierno autonómico de coalición con el PP.

Más allá de este caso, el foco se amplía hacia el portavoz autonómico de Vox, Alejandro Nolasco, quien ha publicado varios libros en SND Editores, una editorial señalada por su cercanía a figuras históricas y contemporáneas del neonazismo español.

A más de mil kilómetros de cualquier núcleo urbano y con presencia humana muy limitada, este enclave parecía a salvo de uno de los símbolos más comunes del paisaje urbano contemporáneo: el grafiti. Sin embargo, en diciembre de 2024 apareció una pintada multicolor en un antiguo hangar británico construido durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial.

El artículo repasa la historia humana de la isla, desde los cazadores de focas del siglo XIX que llevaron a la especie al borde de la extinción, pasando por la intensa actividad ballenera del primer tercio del siglo XX, hasta la ocupación militar británica y la posterior instalación de bases científicas.

Esta declaración surgió como respuesta a un comentario del comentarista conservador Matt Walsh, quien criticó un anuncio publicitario emitido durante la Super Bowl en el que varias mujeres, que afirmaron haber sido víctimas de Epstein y su círculo, pedían al fiscal general Pam Bondi que apoyara su causa y liberara más información. Walsh cuestionaba por qué estas mujeres no habían nombrado directamente a los responsables, sugiriendo que podrían hacerlo de forma protegida a través de congresistas o que su campaña parecía haber comenzado justo tras la salida de Joe Biden del poder.

Babiš señaló directamente al entonces primer ministro británico Boris Johnson como el principal responsable, afirmando que tras su visita a Kiev las negociaciones se descarrilaron y se perdió la oportunidad de poner fin rápido al conflicto.

El político checo también comentó que actualmente los esfuerzos diplomáticos para terminar la guerra se han intensificado, aunque considera que Europa por sí sola no podrá lograrlo. En su opinión, Donald Trump es un actor clave para alcanzar la paz, ya que sin su implicación no será posible establecer garantías de seguridad estables para Ucrania.

Meidner, judío alemán criado en un entorno liberal y asimilado, fue testigo directo del colapso de la democracia alemana y del ascenso del nazismo, incluyendo episodios clave como el incendio del Reichstag y la represión de la izquierda. Estas vivencias alimentaron en él una convicción duradera: el fascismo no era un accidente, sino una posibilidad real del capitalismo en crisis.

Tras huir a Suecia en 1933, Meidner se integró en un país gobernado por la socialdemocracia y desarrolló allí la mayor parte de su carrera como economista jefe de la Confederación Sueca de Sindicatos (LO). Desde ese puesto fue coautor del modelo Rehn-Meidner, que impulsó la política salarial solidaria para reducir desigualdades y fortalecer la cohesión de la clase trabajadora.

El show, seguido por millones de espectadores en todo el mundo, incluyó algunos de sus mayores éxitos y la participación de artistas invitados como Lady Gaga y Ricky Martin, lo que generó una amplia conversación en redes sociales y medios de comunicación.

Aunque una parte importante del público y de la crítica valoró positivamente la puesta en escena por su impacto global y su mensaje cultural, la actuación también despertó rechazo en determinados sectores.

La sentencia, ya firme, se basa principalmente en una prueba de ADN concluyente: los forenses hallaron saliva de la denunciante en el envoltorio del preservativo utilizado, lo que coincide con la versión del acusado de que fue ella quien lo abrió con la boca porque él estaba nervioso. Los jueces argumentan que 'ningún sentido tendría que la víctima facilitara al agresor la penetración' de esa forma, lo que considera incompatible con una violación.

Aunque el testimonio de la joven cumplía los requisitos para desvirtuar la presunción de inocencia y fue corroborado por amigas y policías (relató bloqueo y falta de consentimiento), el tribunal también valoró positivamente la declaración del acusado por su coherencia y claridad.

El contenido fue difundido como un mapa que mostraba el riesgo de rotura de presas, lo que generó preocupación y sensación de alarma entre parte de la audiencia. Sin embargo, la información contenida en el mapa no se correspondía con esa interpretación.

Según aclaró la Asociación Meteorológica del Sureste (AMETSE), el documento mostraba en realidad el riesgo potencial para la población en caso de una hipotética rotura, no la probabilidad real de que dichas presas fallaran. Es decir, el mapa señalaba aquellas infraestructuras cuya rotura, en el escenario más desfavorable posible, podría causar graves daños a núcleos urbanos, servicios esenciales o al medio ambiente.

El seguimiento está siendo elevado, sobre todo en Catalunya y el País Vasco, según los sindicatos. En el caso catalán, se han registrado incidencias adicionales por problemas en la aplicación de los servicios mínimos, que los representantes sindicales atribuyen a que Renfe comunicó tarde dichas obligaciones a los maquinistas.

Esta alerta se produjo tras el estreno en Netflix de un documental sobre la desaparición de Madeleine McCann, en cuyo tercer episodio periodistas portugueses recordaban el escándalo de abusos sexuales a menores en la institución benéfica Casa Pia.

El correo electrónico, titulado 'Jeffrey Epstein', señala que, según los periodistas (incluida Felícia Cabrita), era un 'hecho conocido' que millonarios estadounidenses viajaban a Portugal en aviones privados para abusar sexualmente de niños de la Casa Pia, supuestamente con la connivencia de altos cargos de la institución desde los años 60.

Bruselas plantea que el recibo de la luz deje de utilizarse para financiar políticas ajenas al suministro eléctrico, eliminando conceptos no energéticos que actualmente se cargan en la factura, como determinados costes sociales o cánones.

El texto deja claro desde el inicio que no asume como verificados muchos de los hechos sugeridos en el vídeo y que el caso Epstein se utiliza más como metáfora de una corrupción sistémica que como un análisis jurídico riguroso.

El núcleo del discurso examinado presenta a las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas como un bloque homogéneo, coordinado y moralmente corrupto, enfrentado a una sociedad “normal”. Para ello, el vídeo recurre a metáforas como la “punta del iceberg”, a la insinuación constante de encubrimientos institucionales y a una ambigüedad estratégica que sugiere conexiones sin afirmarlas explícitamente. Esta forma de narrar permite mantener la sensación de misterio y conspiración sin comprometerse con afirmaciones verificables.

El descenso ha afectado especialmente a Zaragoza y Huesca, mientras que Teruel mantiene su representación. La extrema derecha, representada por Vox, ha crecido hasta casi el 18%, reforzando su capacidad de negociación para un posible pacto de gobierno.

Desde una perspectiva que combina termodinámica, geología y geopolítica, el autor sostiene que el agotamiento de acuíferos milenarios en regiones clave como Punjab y Haryana, junto con el aumento de temperaturas y episodios de calor húmedo extremo, convierten el llamado “dividendo demográfico” en una vulnerabilidad estructural. Según datos citados de la NASA y organismos indios, la extracción de agua subterránea supera ampliamente la recarga, lo que amenaza la seguridad alimentaria a medio plazo.

En el plano internacional, el texto describe a India como una pieza central en un “lavado geopolítico” de energía: durante los últimos años habría actuado como intermediaria refinando crudo ruso sancionado para abastecer a Europa.

España invierte en educación universitaria, pero su mercado laboral no absorbe a todos los titulados debido a salarios bajos, precariedad, elevado coste de la vida y escasa inversión en I+D (solo el 1,5 % del PIB frente al 2,2 % de media europea). Esto genera una 'trampa de desarrollo de talento' en regiones como Extremadura, Castilla y León o Castilla-La Mancha, que pierden población activa cualificada, lo que frena el crecimiento económico y debilita servicios públicos, creando un círculo vicioso. Aunque la fuga española es más interna (hacia Madrid y la costa) que externa, destinos como Alemania, Bélgica, Países Bajos e Italia atraen a muchos profesionales. La mitad de los jóvenes españoles desea emigrar en los próximos años, según encuestas.

Esta reforma eliminó el requisito de distancia mínima de 850 metros respecto a centros educativos de secundaria, bachillerato, FP básica y enseñanzas artísticas profesionales, establecido en 2020 por el gobierno del Botànic para combatir la ludopatía, especialmente entre los jóvenes.

De estos 29 locales prorrogados, 21 (el 73 %) se encuentran a menos de 850 metros de institutos o centros equivalentes, por lo que habrían tenido que cerrar si se hubiera mantenido la norma anterior. Además, la mitad de ellos están a menos de 350 metros de estos centros.

Nacido en Sevilla en 1960, fue guitarrista, cantaor y compositor, y uno de los principales impulsores de la fusión entre flamenco, rock y blues que marcó una ruptura estética y sonora a finales de los años setenta y durante la década de los ochenta.

Su trayectoria pública comenzó con el grupo Veneno, formado en 1977 junto a su hermano Raimundo Amador y Kiko Veneno. Aunque el único disco del grupo fue inicialmente incomprendido por crítica y público, con el tiempo se convirtió en una obra fundamental por su carácter innovador. Tras la disolución de Veneno, los tres músicos participaron en proyectos clave como el álbum “La leyenda del tiempo” de Camarón de la Isla, que supuso un punto de inflexión en el flamenco moderno.

En 1978, los hermanos Amador fundaron Pata Negra, proyecto en el que Rafael desempeñó un papel central como compositor y cread]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-rafael-amador-creador-del-sonido-de-pata-negra-y-figura-clave-del-flamenco-rock</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-rafael-amador-creador-del-sonido-de-pata-negra-y-figura-clave-del-flamenco-rock</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinball Map: el mapa colaborativo mundial para localizar máquinas de pinball públicas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Pinball Map es una plataforma en línea fundada en 2008 que ofrece un mapa interactivo y colaborativo a nivel mundial para localizar máquinas de pinball accesibles al público.

Wright-Phillips describe al técnico portugués como una figura intensa y carismática, capaz de generar un fuerte vínculo emocional con sus jugadores, tratarles con justicia y asumir toda la presión mediática para liberar al vestuario. Desde anécdotas explosivas, como una bronca con patada voladora incluida, hasta decisiones tácticas milimétricas que acababan en victoria, el exextremo subraya que todo estaba calculado y que esa seguridad se transmitía al grupo.

Sus imágenes y testimonios muestran cómo la exclusión femenina se ha normalizado hasta extremos cotidianos, como parques infantiles vacíos de niñas o calles donde las mujeres apenas pueden circular solas.

Las niñas afganas ya no pueden estudiar más allá de sexto grado y las mujeres tienen prohibido trabajar en la mayoría de sectores, acceder libremente a la atención sanitaria o compartir espacios con hombres fuera de su familia.

Los hermanos Aragón Bermúdez debutaron en 1939, en plena posguerra española, cuando el país acababa de salir devastado de la Guerra Civil. Procedentes de una extensa familia de artistas de circo, asumieron desde el principio los roles clásicos del trío de payasos: Gaby como clown autoritario, Fofó como augusto bromista y Miliki como contra-augusto, papel que desempeñó desde niño.

La España franquista, empobrecida y represiva, ofrecía pocas oportunidades, por lo que en 1946 decidieron emigrar. Su salto decisivo fue Cuba, donde no solo actuaron en vivo, sino que entraron muy pronto en la televisión, un medio todavía incipiente en el mundo hispano. Desde La Habana, sus programas se exportaron a numerosos países y los convirtieron en figuras internacionales.

Ambas sufrían lesiones físicas, un profundo agotamiento y una sensación de extrañeza que no asociaban al consumo habitual de alcohol. Esa falta de memoria y la necesidad de comprender qué les había pasado las llevó a repetir el mismo recorrido de la noche de la agresión: los mismos bares, las mismas consumiciones y el mismo trayecto, con el objetivo de descartar que hubiera sido culpa suya o una mala decisión propia.

Durante ese proceso, preguntaron a personas cercanas y reflexionaron sobre su comportamiento habitual, concluyendo que nunca se habían marchado con desconocidos ni habían experimentado antes una situación similar.

Sheinbaum defendió el apoyo humanitario a Cuba y aseguró que la isla cumple con sus pagos contractuales, sin facturas pendientes. En 2025, las ventas alcanzaron casi 500 millones de dólares (496 millones según Pemex), representando menos del 1 % de la producción mexicana de crudo, combinando motivos humanitarios y comerciales. El director de Pemex, Víctor Rodríguez, destacó que existe un contrato vigente desde 2023 y que Cuba paga puntualmente.

Bret Devereaux explica que los romanos no sustituyeron la lanza por el gladius, ya que muchas infanterías mediterráneas también llevaban espada como arma secundaria, sino que reemplazaron la lanza por dos pila, una jabalina excepcionalmente pesada y diseñada para un uso táctico muy concreto.

A partir de fuentes literarias limitadas y a menudo tardías, combinadas con datos arqueológicos, el autor sitúa la consolidación de este sistema entre los siglos IV y III a.C., en un contexto de profundas reformas militares tras derrotas traumáticas y de la progresiva centralización del ejército romano como milicia ciudadana organizada por el Estado.

El vídeo ha generado numerosas reacciones burlonas en internet, con comentarios que lo comparan con un niño excusándose por no haber hecho los deberes o que lo acusan de confundir adicción a la adrenalina con inteligencia.

A través de sus dibujos, Wyngaerde dejó un testimonio visual excepcional de cómo eran las ciudades españolas en plena época de Felipe II, antes de que los grandes cambios urbanos borraran muchos de sus trazados originales. El texto parte de una reflexión personal sobre cómo las ciudades cambian con el tiempo y cómo mirar al pasado permite entender mejor el presente urbano.

Uno de los ejemplos más destacados es el dibujo del Palacio de Valsaín, residencia real construida por orden de Felipe II sobre un antiguo pabellón de caza medieval. Hoy en ruinas y sin un proyecto político claro de recuperación, el palacio sobrevive en la memoria gracias a representaciones como la de Wyngaerde. El autor explica que este artista no se limitaba a embellecer los lugares, sino que buscaba una representación lo más fiel posible de la r]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anton-van-der-wyngaerde-y-el-retrato-fiel-de-las-ciudades-espanolas-del-siglo-xvi</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anton-van-der-wyngaerde-y-el-retrato-fiel-de-las-ciudades-espanolas-del-siglo-xvi</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Estudio analiza el revisionismo histórico del golpe de 1973 en TikTok por parte de la extrema derecha chilena]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un artículo académico publicado en la revista LETRAS (Lima) en 2024, titulado “Funcionamiento discursivo de la extrema derecha chilena en prensa y TikTok: revisionismo histórico a 50 años del golpe de Estado”, examina cómo la extrema derecha chilena utiliza TikTok para reinterpretar y difundir una versión revisionista del golpe de Estado de 1973. El estudio, liderado por Diego Rivera López y un equipo de investigadores, analizó 115 videos relevantes publicados entre 2019 y 2023 en cuentas influyentes como las de José Antonio Kast, Teresa Marinovic, Chiara Barchiesi, “El profesor” Silva y la Fundación Nueva Mente. Estos perfiles, con al menos 10 mil seguidores y roles variados (políticos, divulgadores y centros de pensamiento), emplean formatos virales: cortes rápidos, humor, música y consignas para minimizar la conmemoración de las víctimas y priorizar temas como “paz, orden y seguridad” o las “urgencias” actuales.

Este episodio excepcional se explica por unas precipitaciones muy superiores a la media, con 675 mm acumulados frente a los 530 mm habituales, lo que ha permitido que en marzo de 2025 la marisma alcanzara el 100 % de inundación, una situación que no se daba desde hacía quince años.

Tras varios años marcados por una sequía intensa, especialmente entre 2022 y 2023, la recuperación del agua superficial ha tenido efectos positivos a corto plazo.

A través de una escena cotidiana aparentemente banal —pasar productos por el escáner, cobrar y despedir al cliente con una frase aprendida— el autor subraya cómo esa rutina esconde jornadas largas, salarios bajos y una presión constante por mantener la sonrisa pese al cansancio. La cajera se presenta como símbolo de una gran parte de la clase trabajadora que sostiene el sistema con empleos invisibles, poco reconocidos y mal pagados, mientras la inflación, los alquileres y las facturas siguen subiendo.

El texto denuncia que estos trabajos esenciales, tan evidentes durante la pandemia, han vuelto a quedar relegados a un segundo plano en el imaginario colectivo, sin mejora real de sus condiciones.

Tras una investigación abierta por el Defensor del Pueblo, la empresa se comprometió a instalar fuentes de agua potable gratuitas a disposición de los viajeros en los aeropuertos que gestiona. Además, limitó el precio máximo de las botellas de agua en las máquinas expendedoras a 1,60 euros, medida que buscaba paliar las críticas por los importes desproporcionados que se cobraban en estos entornos. La memoria de actividad del Defensor del Pueblo recoge que esta decisión puso fin a la actuación iniciada por las reclamaciones ciudadanas.

Los hechos denunciados se remontan a 2017, cuando la madre presentó la denuncia tras descubrir una conversación en una tablet. En aquel momento, la menor relató que su padre aprovechaba cualquier ocasión para tocarla de forma sexual y la amenazaba con no volver a ver a su madre si lo contaba.

Durante el juicio, la hija, ahora de 18 años, se retractó completamente de la acusación. Declaró ante el tribunal que todo lo que dijo en su día fue mentira y que lo hizo presionada por su madre y por la excuñada de esta. Afirmó que nunca sufrió tocamientos ni violación, que llevaba años viviendo una mentira y que deseaba poder abrazar a su padre, algo impedido por la orden de alejamiento vigente.

Entre los sindicatos excluidos se encuentra el propio SFF-CGT, pese a ser uno de los que cuenta con mayor implantación en el sector y representación en empresas clave como Adif, Renfe, Iryo, Ouigo y Serveo, tanto en el ámbito público como en el privado.

Desde el sindicato consideran que esta exclusión no puede interpretarse como un simple error administrativo, sino como una decisión política consciente.

Goikoetxea ha reconocido que se trata de un mal resultado tanto para Podemos Aragón como para la pluralidad política en la comunidad, subrayando que la convocatoria electoral impulsada por el Partido Popular no ha logrado su objetivo de alcanzar la mayoría absoluta, pero sí ha contribuido a reforzar a la extrema derecha.

La trabajadora reconoció los hechos y asumió la responsabilidad, alegando que tomaba la decisión cuando ya no quedaban clientes en la sala de ventas.

Según la información publicada, el dispositivo sería capaz de emitir ráfagas de energía de hasta 20 gigavatios durante periodos de aproximadamente un minuto, una potencia muy superior al umbral teórico necesario para afectar a sistemas electrónicos sensibles en el espacio.

Mide unos cuatro metros de longitud y pesa alrededor de cinco toneladas, lo que permitiría su transporte e instalación en plataformas móviles, como vehículos terrestres.

En la fachada de un edificio se proyectó el mensaje “Pedo Bowl”, una pieza de denuncia que utilizó una estética inspirada en las estadísticas deportivas para aludir al caso del fallecido financista Jeffrey Epstein y a varias figuras del poder político y empresarial de Estados Unidos. La acción fue grabada y difundida principalmente a través de redes sociales, donde generó un intenso debate y se viralizó rápidamente.

La proyección incluía los nombres de personalidades públicas que han aparecido mencionadas en documentos judiciales relacionados con Epstein. Entre ellas figuraba el del presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, junto a otros líderes políticos y empresarios de alto perfil. En el caso concreto de Trump, el artículo recuerda que ha negado en numerosas ocasiones cualquier relación ilícita con Epstein y que, hasta el momento, no existen pruebas que lo vinculen directament]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-proyeccion-critica-en-nueva-york-vincula-el-caso-epstein-con-figuras-de-la-elite-antes-del-super-bowl</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-proyeccion-critica-en-nueva-york-vincula-el-caso-epstein-con-figuras-de-la-elite-antes-del-super-bowl</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 23:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desmantelada en Alcúdia una red de trata que explotaba sexualmente a mujeres captadas en Sudamérica]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Guardia Civil ha liberado en Mallorca a doce mujeres víctimas de una organización criminal dedicada a la trata de seres humanos con fines de explotación sexual. La operación se ha desarrollado principalmente en la localidad de Alcúdia y ha culminado con la detención de cuatro hombres y una mujer, acusados de delitos de trata, tráfico de drogas, pertenencia a organización criminal y blanqueo de capitales.

Las víctimas, en su mayoría mujeres de origen sudamericano y principalmente colombianas, habían sido captadas en sus países de origen mediante falsas ofertas de trabajo, sobre todo relacionadas con el sector de la hostelería. Sin embargo, una vez llegaban a la isla, eran obligadas a ejercer la prostitución bajo un clima constante de amenazas, coacciones e intimidaciones. Los miembros de la red se aprovechaban de la situación administrativa irregular de las mujeres para evitar que denunciaran los hechos o acudieran a servicios sanitarios y asistenciales.

Esta detección, realizada fuera de la infraestructura oficial de la NASA, confirma que la nave, situada a unas 171 unidades astronómicas (más de 25.000 millones de kilómetros), sigue transmitiendo su señal portadora, aunque extremadamente débil y casi confundida con el ruido cósmico.

Para conseguirlo, adaptaron la instrumentación del telescopio, originalmente no diseñado para la frecuencia de telemetría de 8,4 GHz de Voyager 1, y corrigieron el desplazamiento Doppler debido al movimiento relativo entre la Tierra y la sonda. No se recibieron datos científicos complejos, sino que bastó con verificar la portadora para certificar que la misión continúa activa.

Vincula emotivamente el tema a la muerte de su padre por esta enfermedad y acusa al Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez de priorizar a Broncano sobre la salud pública. Sin embargo, el artículo señala que se trata de una demagogia absoluta, ya que el presupuesto de RTVE es independiente de las partidas de sanidad o investigación, y no se puede equiparar directamente. La crítica se le ha vuelto en contra: numerosos usuarios en X le recuerdan que su programa 'Hora Punta' (2016-2018 en La 1) costaba más por episodio (cerca de 150.000 euros frente a unos 98.000 de 'La Revuelta' renovada) y nunca cuestionó entonces el gasto público ni lo relacionó]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-cardenas-critica-la-renovacion-de-la-revuelta-y-recibe-acusaciones-de-hipocresia-por-su-pasado-en-tve</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/javier-cardenas-critica-la-renovacion-de-la-revuelta-y-recibe-acusaciones-de-hipocresia-por-su-pasado-en-tve</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 22:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Los hackers adolescentes de Israel dan miedo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo presenta a un grupo de adolescentes israelíes con habilidades excepcionales en hacking y ciberseguridad.

Moscú sostiene que Korba actuó siguiendo instrucciones de los servicios de inteligencia ucranianos y que viajó a la capital rusa en diciembre de 2025 con el objetivo de cometer el atentado.

Tras abrir fuego contra el general en un edificio residencial del noroeste de Moscú, el sospechoso habría abandonado Rusia pocas horas después y volado a Dubái, donde finalmente fue localizado y detenido.

El resultado es especialmente relevante porque el distrito había sido ganado por Donald Trump por 13 puntos en las elecciones presidenciales de 2024, lo que llevó a los republicanos a considerar este escaño como una oportunidad clara para recuperarlo.

La elección especial se convocó tras la salida del anterior representante estatal, también demócrata, que fue nombrado comisionado del Departamento de Alcohol y Tabaco del estado por el gobernador republicano Jeff Landry. Aunque el escaño ya estaba en manos demócratas y, por tanto, no supone un cambio de partido, la magnitud de la victoria de Verret Martinez destaca por representar un giro de 37 puntos respecto a los resultados de 2024 en ese mismo distrito.

Un ejemplo poco conocido es la rebelión de esclavos afroamericanos que tuvo lugar en 1842 en territorio de la nación Cherokee, un episodio que cuestiona los relatos tradicionales sobre opresores y oprimidos.

A comienzos del siglo XIX, varias naciones indígenas del sureste de Estados Unidos —entre ellas los Cherokee— optaron por adoptar costumbres europeas para intentar sobrevivir a la presión del gobierno federal y de los colonos. Este proceso de asimilación, que les valió el nombre de las “Cinco Tribus Civilizadas”, incluyó la adopción del cristianismo, la agricultura de plantación y, de forma clave, la esclavitud de personas negras. Para las élites cherokee, poseer esclavos era tanto una fuente de riqueza como una prueba de “civilización” ante Washington.

El 8 de febrero de 1937, tras la caída de Málaga en manos de las tropas sublevadas, una enorme columna de civiles —entre 150.000 y 300.000 personas— huyó por la carretera costera hacia Almería. Durante la huida, fueron atacados desde el aire y el mar, provocando entre 3.000 y 5.000 muertes, lo que convierte este suceso en una de las mayores masacres del conflicto.

El texto se centra especialmente en el uso propagandístico de la fotografía durante y después de estos hechos. Explica cómo el bando sublevado intentó ocultar la masacre mediante la manipulación de la información y el uso engañoso de imágenes publicadas en la prensa de la época, como en el diario ABC de Sevilla.

Alegría acudió a votar al IES Goya, en la capital aragonesa, en los primeros comicios autonómicos adelantados de la historia de la comunidad. Su presencia en el colegio electoral fue breve y su atención a los medios limitada, en parte debido a la actuación de Ndongo, exasesor de Rocío Monasterio (Vox) y conocido por sus acciones de confrontación en actos públicos.

Ndongo se presentó en el entorno del centro educativo y trató de incomodar a la candidata socialista formulándole preguntas de carácter provocador relacionadas con su trayectoria política y con supuestos escándalos.

Dirigido por Marshall Curry, el corto destaca la fusión de símbolos estadounidenses con iconografía nacionalsocialista, discursos antisemitas y la violencia ejercida contra un manifestante que irrumpió en el escenario, mientras niños observaban emocionados. El texto conecta este evento histórico con el contexto actual de 2026, reflexionando sobre el inicio de la presidencia de Trump en 2017, cuando el documental se interpretó como una advertencia, y las similitudes con el discurso de ultraderechas contemporáneas que señalan enemigos abstractos como la inmigración para explicar problemas sociales.

A pesar de la creciente vigilancia israelí y los peligros que implica saltar el muro, muchos se ven obligados a hacerlo para subsistir, pues la situación económica en Cisjordania se ha vuelto insostenible. Según informes de la Oficina de Coordinación de Asuntos Humanitarios de la ONU (OCHA), al menos 16 palestinos han muerto y más de 240 han resultado heridos en estos intentos.

Lluvias persistentes, nieve, viento y crecidas de ríos obligan a animales de muy distintas especies a tomar decisiones rápidas para sobrevivir, con un alto coste energético y riesgos reales de mortalidad. La supervivencia, según explican expertos en comportamiento animal y veterinaria, se basa principalmente en tres estrategias: buscar refugio adecuado, conservar el calor corporal y, cuando es posible, desplazarse a zonas menos castigadas.

En mamíferos terrestres, el principal peligro es la humedad prolongada. Un pelaje mojado pierde capacidad aislante, aumenta el estrés fisiológico y debilita el sistema inmune, facilitando infecciones y reduciendo la capacidad de reacción. Las madrigueras, que normalmente actúan como refugio seguro, pueden convertirse en trampas mortales si se inundan por la subida del nivel freático o la escorrentía.

La posición oficial se resume en una idea clara: se trata de una iniciativa privada y ajena a la política exterior del Estado.

El viaje coincide con un momento políticamente sensible en Venezuela, marcado por la aprobación de una Ley de Amnistía impulsada por el oficialismo, que ha dado lugar a excarcelaciones y revisiones de causas judiciales, algunas de ellas relacionadas con ciudadanos españoles o con doble nacionalidad.

En la charla titulada 'Una conversación honesta sobre la IA y la Humanidad', junto a la neurocientífica Irene Tracey, Harari presentó la inteligencia artificial no como una mera herramienta, sino como un agente autónomo capaz de tomar decisiones, aprender y evolucionar, comparándola con mercenarios sajones que traicionaron a los britanos en el siglo V. Destacó especialmente una supuesta 'exclusiva': que las IAs han acuñado por sí mismas el término 'The Watchers' (Los Observadores) para referirse a los humanos, invirtiendo los roles de vigilantes y vigilados, lo que generó temor entre los asistentes.

Casos como el de Ramón Bultó, de 57 años, o Iván Aranda, de 46, reflejan una realidad cada vez más común: salarios relativamente estables que no garantizan seguridad residencial a largo plazo. La imposibilidad de ahorrar para la entrada de una hipoteca, el encarecimiento sostenido del alquiler y la escasez de oferta empujan a muchos a asumir contratos frágiles y caros, sin la tranquilidad que tradicionalmente aportaba la propiedad como “plan de pensiones”.

El documental de HBO Max *Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!*, dirigido por Judd Apatow y Mike Bonfiglio, repasa la trayectoria de un creador incansable que nunca ha contemplado la jubilación. Actor, guionista, director, productor y compositor, Brooks convirtió el humor en una herramienta política y cultural, capaz de ridiculizar el poder y desafiar los tabúes.

Nacido como Melvin Kaminsky en Brooklyn, creció marcado por la muerte temprana de su padre y por una infancia de burlas y precariedad. Esa mezcla de rabia y vulnerabilidad se transformó en su combustible creativo. Sus primeros pasos en la televisión, especialmente en *Your Show of Shows* junto a Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Neil Simon o Woody Allen, lo situaron en el epicentro del nacimiento del humor televisivo estadounidense. Con Reiner creó *El hombre de 2000 años*, uno de sus primeros grandes éxitos.

Saberi denuncia la grave crisis económica que está detrás de las protestas y destaca el papel fundamental de las mujeres en la movilización popular. Desde la muerte de Mahsa Amini en 2022, miles de iraníes han salido a las calles en demanda de un cambio radical, no solo en derechos, sino en el sistema político. A pesar de la represión brutal y el apagón informativo, la activista asegura que el régimen tiene los días contados. Sin embargo, también advierte sobre los retos para el futuro, señalando que la transición de una teocracia a una democracia secular no será fácil.

Aunque se presenta como medida de protección infantil, el texto argumenta que va más allá: supone un intento de España y Europa por recuperar autonomía regulatoria frente al dominio de las plataformas estadounidenses de Silicon Valley. En un contexto de fuerte dependencia tecnológica de EE.UU. (con el 83% del mercado de nube en manos de proveedores americanos), el regreso de Trump y las presiones geopolíticas han acelerado la búsqueda de soberanía digital. La reacción de Elon Musk, llamando a Sánchez 'tirano' y 'traidor' en X, refuerza esta interpretación de choque de poderes.

Esta medida, tras una reunión mantenida con el experto, podría recaudar más de 5.200 millones de euros anuales según estimaciones del Observatorio Fiscal de la Unión Europea. El objetivo principal es destinar estos fondos a una prestación universal por crianza que permita erradicar la pobreza infantil en el país, un problema que el ministro califica de persistente y con niveles muy altos. Bustinduy ha resaltado el potencial impacto social de la iniciativa y la necesidad de recuperar el control democrático sobre aspectos económicos clave.

Por un lado, logró el récord del mejor promedio resolviendo cinco cubos con un tiempo de 3,84 segundos, y por otro, el récord del cubo individual más rápido con 3,05 segundos. Este logro es especialmente notable porque el récord de promedio es considerado más difícil que el de un solo cubo, ya que requiere constancia y precisión en múltiples intentos. Xuanyi utilizó un método avanzado llamado ZV, creado en 2003, que exige memorizar cerca de 800 algoritmos, algo que hasta ahora parecía impracticable para establecer récords mundiales. Durante la competición, sus tiempos fueron progresando de 5,09 s a 3,37 s en su quinto intento, asegurando la media ganadora.

Artemis III se mantiene prevista para 2028, pero depende del éxito del Human Landing System (HLS) de SpaceX basado en Starship, que requiere una prueba no tripulada en 2027 y demostrar trasvase orbital de propelentes.

La iniciativa, titulada “480 km para aprender”, nació a partir de una reflexión cotidiana compartida con sus compañeros de clase.

Windscribe ha explicado que el servidor afectado opera bajo una arquitectura “RAM-only”, es decir, no utiliza discos duros ni sistemas de almacenamiento persistente. Toda la información se ejecuta exclusivamente en memoria volátil, lo que implica que, al apagar o desconectar el equipo, los datos desaparecen automáticamente.

El texto se centra en explicar un repunte previo y un posterior desplome del déficit, poniendo el foco en las decisiones tomadas por los importadores estadounidenses ante la inminente entrada en vigor de nuevos aranceles. Según se expone, muchas empresas optaron por adelantar compras y acumular inventarios de todo tipo de productos para esquivar el encarecimiento futuro derivado de las medidas proteccionistas, lo que provocó un aumento artificial de las importaciones en un primer momento.

Posteriormente, una vez aplicados los aranceles, las importaciones se redujeron de forma notable, contribuyendo a un aparente reequilibrio de la balanza comercial. El autor matiza que este ajuste no se debe únicamente al efecto directo de los aranceles, sino también a cambios más profundos en las relaciones económicas internacionales.

A pesar de las acusaciones y de la investigación judicial que sigue sobre la empresa, Gómez no ha liquidado la sociedad ni ha cesado sus actividades. La empresa fue creada en 2023, y aunque presentó cuentas vacías por su primer mes de actividad, no cumplió con la obligación de entregar las cuentas correspondientes a 2024.

Este virus herpes común permanece latente en el organismo de hasta el 60 % de la población adulta, sin causar síntomas evidentes en la mayoría de los casos. Sin embargo, en personas mayores, puede reactivarse de forma localizada y contribuir a procesos patológicos en la cabeza del fémur.

Los científicos analizaron muestras de tejido óseo de pacientes con osteonecrosis (muerte del tejido óseo por falta de irrigación sanguínea) y encontraron ADN y proteínas del HCMV especialmente en las zonas necróticas y en los vasos sanguíneos dañados.

Según la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, los cambios introducidos en la Ley de Acompañamiento de la Comunidad Valenciana suponen una restricción grave de los derechos de las personas LGTBI+ y generan una desigualdad territorial incompatible con la Constitución. El Ejecutivo considera inaceptable que los ciudadanos valencianos tengan menos derechos y libertades que el resto de la población en España.

La reforma, aprobada en mayo para garantizar el respaldo de Vox a los presupuestos autonómicos, incluye enmiendas que eliminan derechos previamente consolidados.

Estas viviendas, en una zona cotizada como la Playa de San Juan, se adjudicaron sin los controles previos que existían antes de las reformas normativas impulsadas por el Gobierno valenciano de Carlos Mazón en 2024, que eliminaron la obligatoriedad de inscripción en el registro autonómico para promociones privadas y otros requisitos para prevenir fraudes.

Este hecho contrasta con la grave emergencia habitacional en la Comunitat Valenciana: el registro de demandantes de vivienda protegida se multiplicó por seis en tres años, pasando de unos 13.600 a finales de 2022 a 76.475 unidades de convivencia activa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/escandalo-en-alicante-cargos-del-pp-acceden-a-viviendas-protegidas-mientras-crece-la-lista-de-espera-en-la-comunitat-valenciana</guid><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 03:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un documental recoge testimonios sobre el deterioro de la sanidad pública andaluza]]></title><description><![CDATA[El documental “Salud No Responde”, dirigido por Pablo Coca e impulsado por el movimiento Marea Blanca, ofrece una radiografía del estado actual de la sanidad pública en Andalucía a través de testimonios directos de pacientes, profesionales sanitarios y activistas.

Lejos de depender exclusivamente de decisiones políticas o de la agenda climática, el despliegue de las energías limpias se ha convertido en un fenómeno estructural, impulsado por factores económicos, tecnológicos y financieros.

Según datos de BloombergNEF, en 2025 la inversión mundial en transición energética alcanzó un récord histórico de 2,3 billones de dólares, un 8% más que el año anterior, incluso en un contexto de tensiones geopolíticas, incertidumbre regulatoria y giros políticos adversos en Estados Unidos. Por segundo año consecutivo, la inversión en energías limpias superó a la destinada a combustibles fósiles, mientras que esta última cayó por primera vez desde 2020.

Este patrón meteorológico se debe a un debilitamiento del vórtice polar, una gran masa de aire frío sobre el Ártico que, al perder fuerza, provoca ondulaciones en la corriente en chorro. Estas ondulaciones, junto con un potente anticiclón situado entre Groenlandia e Islandia, actúan como un bloqueo que impide el paso habitual de los frentes por el norte de Europa y los desvía hacia latitudes más bajas, afectando directamente al sur de la península ibérica.

Estudios científicos, como los de la Universidad de Lisboa y la Unión Geofísica Americana, relacionan estos bloqueos en el Atlántico norte con un aumento de días húmedos en el suroeste de Europa, incluida España.

Uno de los hitos más relevantes es la finalización práctica del puerto a x86_64, superando su tradicional limitación a arquitecturas de 32 bits. Además, el soporte SMP para sistemas multinúcleo, una carencia histórica del proyecto, ha mejorado de forma notable.

Otro aspecto clave es el progreso en controladores de hardware, impulsado en gran medida por el uso de la capa rump de NetBSD, que ha permitido reutilizar drivers existentes y ampliar la compatibilidad sin partir de cero.

En enero, el sistema eléctrico registró un sobrecoste de unos 105 millones de euros respecto al mismo mes del año anterior, elevando el gasto total en restricciones técnicas hasta los 335 millones. Este incremento está directamente relacionado con las medidas adoptadas tras el apagón de abril de 2025 para reforzar la seguridad del suministro y evitar nuevos episodios de tensión en la red.

El Gobierno, con el aval de la Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (CNMC), permitió a Red Eléctrica mantener durante un año ajustes operativos que inicialmente iban a ser temporales.

Quiles, que formó parte de las listas de Se acabó la fiesta (SALF), el partido de Alvise Pérez, recibió el reconocimiento de Tellado, quien trasladó la gratitud de 'miles y miles de españoles' por su capacidad para dar voz a temas que otros no abordan. Tellado defendió estas acciones comparándolas con el formato de entrevistas callejeras del programa Caiga quien caiga de Wyoming, cuestionando por qué se critica a unos y no a otros.

Paralelamente, el dirigente popular criticó el 'populismo de derechas', en clara alusión a Vox, al que acusó de ofrecer 'soluciones sencillas para problemas complejos' y de no haber gobernado nunca.

Según el relato de la denunciante, el partido inicialmente atendió su caso, pero después intentó disuadirla de hacer ruido y progresivamente la ignoró. Tras la publicación en El País de estas acusaciones, que salpican también a cargos cercanos a Isabel Díaz Ayuso como Ana Millán y Alfonso Serrano, medios afines al PP, especialmente El Confidencial, han publicado información sobre dos denuncias previas de la exconcejala en su etapa como profesora en un instituto de Fuenlabrada (una por acoso sexual en 2018 y otra por acoso laboral en 2020), ambas archivadas por falta de pruebas concluyentes, aunque en uno de los casos el acusado fue condenado por coacciones leves.

Todas ellas cuentan con algún nivel de protección policial tras haber denunciado a sus agresores. Entre las víctimas se identifican colectivos especialmente vulnerables, como las 1.238 adolescentes menores de edad y las 2.472 mujeres mayores de 65 años. Además, más de la mitad de las mujeres protegidas, 53.716, tienen hijos o hijas a su cargo, lo que incrementa el riesgo y la complejidad de estas situaciones.

El sistema VioGén evalúa el nivel de riesgo al que se enfrentan las víctimas, desde bajo hasta extremo. Actualmente, 25 mujeres se encuentran en riesgo extremo, con peligro real para su vida, mientras que 953 están en riesgo alto y más de 14.500 en riesgo medio.

La medida permitía hasta diez días de ausencia al año sin necesidad de presentar un certificado médico, con la intención de reducir el estrés y las dificultades académicas asociadas a dolores menstruales severos. Para evitar cualquier tipo de estigmatización, la institución decidió abrir formalmente el dispositivo a todo el alumnado, independientemente de su género, basándolo en un principio de confianza.

Sin embargo, en los meses siguientes, el profesorado detectó un elevado número de ausencias injustificadas entre estudiantes varones de la escuela de ingeniería Ensil-Ensci. La investigación interna reveló que alrededor de cincuenta estudiantes hombres habían utilizado este permiso, acumulando cerca de cien días de ausencia en apenas tres meses.

Este método se presentó como una alternativa más ética a la descarga masiva de copias piratas desde sitios como LibGen, práctica que la propia empresa y otras como Meta, Google y OpenAI habían utilizado anteriormente, aunque con preocupaciones internas sobre su legalidad.

Se menciona un contrato de 25 millones de dólares, conversaciones con Ariane de Rothschild (CEO del Grupo Edmond de Rothschild) sobre oportunidades tras el golpe en Ucrania en 2014, y sugerencias racistas de Epstein para excluir africanos de consejos asesores. Además, se vincula a Epstein con el Mossad y estrategias geopolíticas en Oriente Medio, como crear enemigos en varios países o supuesta ayuda estadounidense al ISIS. El texto incluye acusaciones graves de rituales con bebés en yates (incluyendo una entrevista del FBI sobre George H.W.

Estos grupos comparten la explotación de los malestares de los jóvenes varones en un contexto de precariedad económica, crisis de vivienda y dificultades para emanciparse, cruzados con cambios en los roles de género impulsados por el feminismo. Alabao explica que estas comunidades ofrecen respuestas simplistas que culpan al feminismo y a las mujeres, proporcionando además un sentido de pertenencia. Destaca la brecha de género en las preferencias políticas: los jóvenes varones muestran mayor apoyo a derechas radicales y rechazo al feminismo, influido por el consumo masivo de contenido antifeminista online, el aislamiento post-pandemia y la falta de modelos alternativos de masculinidad.

Además, difundió afirmaciones sobre las circunstancias de la muerte de Kira cuya veracidad no quedó acreditada durante el procedimiento judicial.

Durante los trabajos de construcción de un aparcamiento subterráneo, se vieron afectadas las raíces de ocho tilos que se encontraban en terrenos públicos y que inicialmente se pretendía conservar. Los daños ocasionaron un secado parcial de los árboles y generaron un riesgo de vuelco que comprometía la seguridad de los peatones, lo que llevó finalmente a su retirada.

La situación fue trasladada a la comisión municipal de Urbanismo, Obras Públicas y Medio Ambiente por el concejal socialista Ramón Tuero, quien recogió la preocupación de los vecinos por la desaparición de los árboles y del parterre en el que se ubicaban, así como por la posible falta de autorización para su tala.

El problema no se limita a una mala racha coyuntural, sino que responde a un modelo industrial altamente concentrado y dominado por grandes corporaciones.

Según estimaciones del propio sector, las pérdidas de los productores superan los 17.000 millones de dólares, pese a que algunos cortes de carne han subido hasta un 16 % y, en determinados periodos, incluso un 70 % en apenas unos meses. Esta subida no repercute en los ingresos de los criadores, que venden su ganado a precios cada vez más bajos. Un factor clave es el funcionamiento de los mercados de futuros, diseñados en teoría para estabilizar precios, pero que en la práctica favorecen la especulación de grandes fondos y empresas, dejando a los pe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-del-sector-carnico-en-ee-uu-precios-record-para-el-consumidor-y-ruina-para-los-ganaderos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-del-sector-carnico-en-ee-uu-precios-record-para-el-consumidor-y-ruina-para-los-ganaderos</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 16:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Condenado por delito de odio e islamofobia tras agredir a una mujer con hiyab en Madrid]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Audiencia Provincial de Madrid ha condenado a un hombre a seis meses de prisión por un delito de odio, además de un delito leve de lesiones, tras insultar y agredir a una mujer musulmana que llevaba hiyab en plena vía pública. Los hechos ocurrieron el 5 de junio de 2024 y, según la sentencia, estuvieron motivados por prejuicios religiosos y un claro componente islamófobo.

Durante el incidente, el condenado increpó a la víctima delante de varios testigos con expresiones gravemente vejatorias y degradantes, exigiéndole que abandonara España por su condición de musulmana. Cuando la mujer intentó grabar la escena con su teléfono móvil para documentar lo sucedido, el agresor se abalanzó sobre ella, la amenazó de muerte y le retorció el brazo con fuerza para impedir la grabación, causándole lesiones leves que requirieron asistencia médica básica y sanaron en pocos días.

Su intervención no será presencial, sino a través de una videollamada, en un acto que reunirá a diversas figuras vinculadas a la derecha y la ultraderecha internacional, entre ellas el presidente argentino Javier Milei.

La participación de Ayuso se produce en un contexto político especialmente delicado en Estados Unidos, marcado por la publicación de nueva información relacionada con los archivos del pederasta Jeffrey Epstein, que vuelven a salpicar directamente a Trump.

Tras fracasar la vía diplomática para convencer a Reino Unido de mantener sus tropas, la inteligencia militar israelí (Aman), bajo el mando del coronel Binyamin Gibli, lanzó en 1954 la Operación Susannah. Esta consistió en una operación de falsa bandera: agentes reclutados en la Unidad 131, compuesta mayoritariamente por judíos egipcios, colocaron bombas de baja potencia en objetivos británicos y estadounidenses en El Cairo y Alejandría (oficinas postales, bibliotecas estadounidenses y teatros), con el fin de simular inestabilidad y atribuir los atentados a grupos como los Hermanos Musulmanes o comunistas, presionando así a los británicos para no evacuar la zona.

Los artefactos eran rudimentarios (bolsas de ácido que corroían y detonaban nitroglicerina), y causaron daños mínimos.

Estas impresionantes obras fueron creadas por los artistas alemanes Leopold Blaschka (1822-1895) y su hijo Rudolf Blaschka (1857-1939), expertos vidrieros que trabajaron durante más de cincuenta años, desde 1886 hasta 1936. En total, produjeron 4.300 modelos de vidrio que representan con gran precisión científica 780 especies de plantas, exclusivamente para Harvard.

La colección fue encargada por el profesor George Lincoln Goodale, director fundador del Museo Botánico de la universidad, y financiada por las benefactoras Mary Lee Ware y su madre Elizabeth. El objetivo principal era disponer de modelos tridimensionales duraderos y de color estable para la enseñanza de la botánica, en una época en la que preservar plantas reales resultaba complicado.

La publicación generó una fuerte polémica e indignación tanto de demócratas como de republicanos, incluido el senador Tim Scott, quien lo calificó como 'lo más racista que he visto en esta Casa Blanca' y pidió su eliminación inmediata. Inicialmente, la secretaria de prensa Karoline Leavitt defendió el contenido, argumentando que se trataba de un meme de internet inspirado en 'El Rey León' —con Trump como rey de la jungla— y tachó de 'falsa indignación' las críticas.

Esta tendencia confirma que, pese a los compromisos climáticos asumidos en las últimas décadas, las emisiones globales de CO₂ continúan siendo demasiado elevadas como para frenar su acumulación en la atmósfera.

El CO₂ es el principal gas de efecto invernadero generado por la actividad humana y el mayor responsable del calentamiento global actual. Las mediciones realizadas en estaciones de referencia como el Observatorio de Mauna Loa, que registra datos desde 1958, muestran un aumento constante y sostenido de su concentración, impulsado sobre todo por la quema de combustibles fósiles, la industria y el uso intensivo de energía.

Lejos de ser simples curiosidades, estos problemas marcaron el desarrollo de la física moderna al obligar a revisar conceptos como entropía, irreversibilidad, información y tiempo.

El texto comienza con el demonio de Maxwell, un experimento mental que parecía permitir la violación de la segunda ley al crear orden sin gasto de energía. La resolución llegó al comprender que la información es física: medir, almacenar y borrar datos tiene un coste energético inevitable, formulado en el límite de Landauer. Al incluir al observador en el sistema, la entropía total vuelve a aumentar.

El texto se centra especialmente en el caso del alcalde de Móstoles, figura cercana a Ayuso, acusado por una concejala de acoso sexual y laboral. Según el columnista, la respuesta del PP madrileño ha sido negar los hechos y amenazar judicialmente a la presunta víctima, una actitud que considera coherente con una estrategia histórica del partido: negar cualquier irregularidad, presentar las acusaciones como conspiraciones políticas y atacar a quien denuncia.

El ganadero destaca que la regulación y el pago de indemnizaciones han mejorado notablemente en los últimos años, reduciendo la sensación de abandono que históricamente sufría el sector.

La propuesta busca acelerar su entrada en vigor y va más allá del mínimo exigido por la Unión Europea, introduciendo la reparabilidad como un elemento clave de la calidad esperable de un producto. En la práctica, si un bien no puede repararse, podría considerarse defectuoso, lo que supone un cambio relevante en la forma de entender la protección al consumidor.

Uno de los puntos centrales del borrador es el incentivo directo a la reparación frente a la sustitución. Los consumidores podrán elegir entre reparar o reemplazar un producto averiado, pero solo la opción de reparar conllevará una ampliación de los derechos de garantía. Concretamente, Alemania plantea extender un año adicional el plazo de reclamación si el usuario opta por arreglar el producto en lugar de cambiarlo por uno nuevo.

Liderado por Daniel M. F., conocido como “El Ratilla”, la organización operaba desde 2013, mezclando hooliganismo radical con crimen organizado. Durante la operación policial se arrestaron trece personas y se incautaron drogas, armas y más de 100.000 euros en efectivo, mientras tres de los detenidos ingresaron en prisión provisional.

Ambientada en Villanil, un pueblo de retaguardia suspendido en una espera indefinida, la obra construye un espacio donde los días se suceden con una repetición inquietante, marcada por mínimas variaciones que invitan al lector a reajustar su forma de leer y percibir el paso del tiempo.

El protagonista, Eduardo Colina, alférez joven y abogado de formación, encarna esa posición intermedia entre la vida civil y el conflicto armado. Lejos de cualquier heroicidad, su mirada atenta a los detalles cotidianos —los gestos repetidos, los sonidos, los olores, las texturas— convierte la novela en una exploración del tiempo ordinario. La estructura del libro, con capítulos numerados como días, refuerza una poética de la duración en la que la narrac]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-poetica-de-lo-cotidiano-y-la-espera-belica-en-la-novela-de-jorge-isusi</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-poetica-de-lo-cotidiano-y-la-espera-belica-en-la-novela-de-jorge-isusi</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 12:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Un correo no verificado vincula de forma especulativa a Jeffrey Epstein con el caso Madeleine McCann]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un artículo publicado por Cultura Colectiva asegura que se ha filtrado un correo electrónico supuestamente incluido en los archivos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein que mencionaría el caso de Madeleine McCann, la niña británica desaparecida en Portugal en 2007. Según la pieza, el email hace referencia tanto a la desaparición de la menor como al escándalo de la Casa Pía, un caso real de abusos sexuales a menores en un orfanato portugués que salió a la luz en los años 2000.

El texto sostiene que el correo, cuyo contenido completo, autoría y contexto no están verificados, citaba un supuesto documental de Netflix Canadá en el que se afirmaría que empresarios y personas adineradas utilizaban jets privados para viajar a Portugal con fines de explotación sexual infantil. La mención a Madeleine McCann aparece de forma indirecta, sin aportar pruebas ni datos nuevos contrastados por autoridades judiciales o policiales.

Según su relato, inicialmente sufrió insinuaciones, comentarios sobre su físico y presiones para mantener una relación personal; al negarse, fue víctima de represalias profesionales: exclusión de actos, humillaciones, vacío institucional y relegación de funciones, lo que testigos confirman.

Desde febrero de 2024, la edil envió nueve correos al gabinete de Isabel Díaz Ayuso solicitando intervención y amparo, se reunió en tres ocasiones con altos cargos del PP madrileño (Alfonso Serrano y Ana Millán) y remitió un escrito de 20 páginas al comité de Derechos y Garantías del PP nacional.

El punto de partida es el archivo British Cartoon Archive de la Universidad de Kent, que conserva 159 registros de viñetas etiquetadas con el nombre de Franco. Tras un proceso de depuración que elimina duplicidades, versiones repetidas y dibujos con menciones meramente anecdóticas, el autor del artículo identifica un total de 62 caricaturas en las que Franco aparece representado de forma directa y satírica. Estas imágenes se presentan en tres entregas, comenzando por las publicadas entre 1936 y 1939.

El texto sostiene que estos archivos confirmarían antiguas teorías conspirativas y vincula a Estados Unidos, la Unión Europea, la OTAN y diversos gobiernos con una estructura criminal organizada.

El artículo centra parte de sus acusaciones en Kosovo, afirmando que grupos albaneses habrían actuado como intermediarios en el tráfico masivo de niños para satisfacer a élites occidentales, con el respaldo de la OTAN. También se mencionan supuestos casos históricos, como la sustracción de órganos durante la guerra de Yugoslavia, y se citan testimonios no verificados procedentes de fuentes rusas sobre crímenes similares en Ucrania.

Según el contenido de la misiva, Rodríguez defendió la actuación del Ejecutivo regional y negó que los conocidos como ‘protocolos de la vergüenza’ discriminaran a los mayores por razones ajenas a su situación clínica.

El artículo contextualiza estas cartas en un marco más amplio de denuncias y testimonios de familiares que relatan desprecios institucionales, falta de respuestas y una gestión que consideran injusta y dolorosa.

A partir de ahí, cuestiona la falta de coherencia de actores como Manos Limpias o el Colegio de Abogados de Madrid, muy diligentes en unos casos y silenciosos en otros.

La medida llega tras los problemas de navegación sufridos durante el conflicto de junio de 2025, cuando se registraron fallos generalizados en las señales de posicionamiento que afectaron tanto a la aviación civil como a los activos militares iraníes. Este episodio puso de relieve la vulnerabilidad de depender de un sistema gestionado por una potencia rival.

BeiDou, operativo a escala global desde 2020, cuenta con una constelación de más de 50 satélites, frente a los aproximadamente 31 del GPS estadounidense. Esta mayor densidad, unida a una arquitectura que incluye satélites en órbitas geoestacionarias, ofrece una cobertura especialmente robusta en Asia y Oriente Medio, lo que resulta ventajoso para un país con una geografía compleja como Irán.

Martín Moratilla ha explicado que, una vez que el Centro de Coordinación Operativa Integrado (Cecopi) tuvo conocimiento del riesgo existente en la presa de Forata, se llegó a valorar la evacuación de los municipios potencialmente afectados.

Tras conocerse la deportación, el juez federal Richard G. Stearns calificó lo ocurrido como un error y dio al Gobierno la oportunidad de corregir la situación. En ese contexto, recomendó que se facilitara el regreso de la estudiante mediante la concesión de un visado de estudiante, con el objetivo de restablecer la situación previa a su expulsión y permitirle continuar con sus estudios universitarios.

El episodio se produjo en un contexto general festivo y animado, marcado por actuaciones musicales y una cuidada puesta en escena que buscaba reflejar tanto la vida urbana de Milán como el entorno montañoso de los Alpes italianos.

Los abucheos se escucharon principalmente al inicio del desfile de la delegación israelí en el estadio de Milán, aunque quedaron rápidamente amortiguados por la música ambiental de alto volumen. Los atletas, encabezados por la abanderada Mariia Seniuk, mantuvieron una actitud serena y continuaron su recorrido con la bandera nacional en alto. En otros escenarios paralelos, como Cortina d’Ampezzo y Predazzo, la recepción fue desigual: algunos aplausos en el primer caso y nuevos abucheos aislados en el segundo.

Enero cerró con una media de 119 litros por metro cuadrado, un 85% más de lo normal, convirtiéndose en el enero más lluvioso en 25 años. Este encadenamiento de temporales, que ha provocado evacuaciones, inundaciones y graves problemas de infraestructuras, está relacionado con cambios en la circulación atmosférica a gran escala.

Los meteorólogos apuntan a la corriente en chorro —un potente flujo de aire que rodea el hemisferio norte— como elemento clave para entender la situación. Habitualmente, esta corriente guía las borrascas atlánticas por latitudes más septentrionales, afectando sobre todo al norte de Europa. Sin embargo, en las últimas semanas se ha desplazado hacia el sur debido a un patrón atmosférico anómalo, con el anticiclón de las Azores situado mucho más al norte de lo habitual, entre Groenlandi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-debilitamiento-de-la-corriente-en-chorro-explica-el-encadenamiento-de-borrascas-intensas-en-espana</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 10:35:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El gran problema del feminismo, Denuncias falsas de maltrato, Jóvenes fachas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo parece ser un debate o discusión sobre temas relacionados con el feminismo, con un enfoque en las denuncias falsas de maltrato y la aparición de movimientos juveniles con ideologías conservadoras.

Esta iniciativa, promovida en reuniones del PPE en Croacia con la participación del canciller alemán Merz, apunta a garantizar la seguridad en Europa del Este, especialmente frente a Ucrania, país que busca adherirse a la UE en enero de 2027. La medida, sin embargo, aumenta el riesgo de un conflicto directo con Rusia, ya que cualquier incidente podría activar automáticamente la asistencia militar de la UE. Paralelamente, la guerra en Ucrania se intensifica y el país está al borde del colapso. Estados Unidos ha pedido a Rusia que detenga temporalmente los ataques al suministro energético, mientras la UE solo puede ofrecer ayuda limitada, con 153 millones de euros en emergencia.

Partiendo de una referencia literaria a *La naranja mecánica* de Anthony Burgess —incluido un reconocimiento explícito de un error inicial atribuyéndola a Aldous Huxley—, el autor utiliza la metáfora de aceptar o escupir un mensaje para introducir su tesis central: durante años, el establishment ha negado que el feminismo señalara realidades estructurales, reduciendo las desigualdades a cuestiones biológicas o individuales.

El texto aporta ejemplos contemporáneos que refuerzan esa crítica. Uno de los más destacados es el uso de servicios de inteligencia artificial para generar desnudos cosificadores en redes sociales, donde los datos muestran que la inmensa mayoría de solicitudes provienen de hombres y están dirigidas a mujeres. Para el autor, esto no es una cuestión ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/patriarcado-poder-y-desinformacion-una-critica-al-sistema-desde-los-datos-y-la-experiencia-social</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/patriarcado-poder-y-desinformacion-una-critica-al-sistema-desde-los-datos-y-la-experiencia-social</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 07:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El misil antibuque Abu Mahdi amplía el alcance ofensivo iraní y desafía la defensa naval en el Mar Arábigo]]></title><description><![CDATA[El despliegue del misil antibuque Abu Mahdi por parte de Irán supone una modificación relevante del equilibrio militar en el Mar Arábigo, una zona clave para el comercio global y las operaciones navales de Estados Unidos y sus aliados. A diferencia de sistemas anteriores centrados en la defensa costera del Golfo Pérsico, el Abu Mahdi introduce una capacidad ofensiva de largo alcance que extiende la amenaza iraní más allá de sus aguas inmediatas. Con un alcance estimado superior a los 1.000 kilómetros, este misil permite a Teherán influir en áreas que hasta ahora se consideraban relativamente seguras para la navegación militar estadounidense.

El Abu Mahdi es un misil de crucero subsónico propulsado por turborreactor, diseñado para vuelos prolongados y perfiles de ataque complejos. Su trayectoria combina fases a gran altitud, que optimizan el consumo de combustible, con un descenso final a vuelo rasante sobre la superficie del mar. Este perfil reduce de forma significativa la detección ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-misil-antibuque-abu-mahdi-amplia-el-alcance-ofensivo-irani-y-desafia-la-defensa-naval-en-el-mar-arabigo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-misil-antibuque-abu-mahdi-amplia-el-alcance-ofensivo-irani-y-desafia-la-defensa-naval-en-el-mar-arabigo</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 06:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mensajes entre Bannon y Epstein revelan una estrategia de la ultraderecha para atacar al papa Francisco y reforzar a la extrema derecha europea]]></title><description><![CDATA[La desclasificación de nuevos documentos relacionados con Jeffrey Epstein ha sacado a la luz mensajes intercambiados entre el financiero y Steve Bannon, exasesor de Donald Trump, que muestran con claridad dos de las grandes prioridades de la ultraderecha estadounidense durante el primer mandato de Trump. Por un lado, el intento de debilitar el pontificado del papa Francisco, visto como una amenaza ideológica por los sectores más conservadores del catolicismo en Estados Unidos; por otro, la financiación y coordinación de fuerzas populistas y de extrema derecha en Europa con el objetivo de erosionar la Unión Europea desde dentro.

En uno de los mensajes más llamativos, fechado en junio de 2019, Bannon escribe a Epstein que 'derribarán' al papa Francisco, al que equipara con otros grandes enemigos políticos y geoestratégicos como la UE, China o los Clinton. Estas palabras se producen en el contexto de una campaña más amplia contra el Pontífice, alimentada por su perfil reformista: defensa]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mensajes-entre-bannon-y-epstein-revelan-una-estrategia-de-la-ultraderecha-para-atacar-al-papa-francisco-y-reforzar-a-la-extrema-derecha-europea</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/mensajes-entre-bannon-y-epstein-revelan-una-estrategia-de-la-ultraderecha-para-atacar-al-papa-francisco-y-reforzar-a-la-extrema-derecha-europea</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2026 05:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El maltrato animal en Roldán pone en evidencia la ineficacia de las leyes de protección animal]]></title><description><![CDATA[El caso de un perro maltratado en Roldán, Cartagena, ha generado indignación y preocupación entre las protectoras de animales de la región.

Las responsables de las protectoras denuncian la ineficacia de la legislación española en cuanto al maltrato animal, ya que el agresor acumulaba varias denuncias sin que se tomaran medidas contundentes. Este caso pone de manifiesto un problema estructural de empatía en la sociedad y la normalización de la violencia hacia los animales, reflejada también en los medios de comunicación.

Argumentan que las plataformas digitales exponen a los jóvenes a contenido nocivo como el odio y la desinformación, y que los controles actuales son insuficientes. Este debate surge tras las preocupaciones sobre los efectos negativos de las redes sociales en los menores, como el ciberacoso y la violencia. La CDU de Schleswig-Holstein ha propuesto una moción para introducir una verificación obligatoria de edad. Este enfoque no es nuevo, ya que Australia ya tomó medidas similares, y Pedro Sánchez en España también ha mostrado interés en regular el acceso a las redes sociales en la misma línea. Si se aprueba la ley en Alemania, las plataformas deberán bloquear a los menores de 16 años, con posibles sanciones si no cumplen.

A principios de los años 2000, Boeing necesitaba trasladar grandes secciones del 787, fabricadas en colaboración con empresas japonesas e italianas, pero el transporte marítimo era lento y costoso. La solución fue modificar cuatro Boeing 747-400, ampliando su fuselaje central para acomodar estas piezas. El primer avión convertido realizó su vuelo inaugural en 2006 y la certificación por la FAA se obtuvo en 2007. Las cuatro unidades del programa provienen de aviones previamente operados por Air China, China Airlines y Malaysia Airlines, que fueron adquiridos por Boeing y posteriormente transformados por Evergreen International Airlines.

Los intercambios, fechados principalmente entre 2018 y 2019, coinciden con el periodo en el que Bannon, ya fuera de la Casa Blanca, recorrió Europa con la intención de articular un frente ultraderechista y euroescéptico dentro del Parlamento Europeo.

En los mensajes, Bannon se muestra especialmente interesado en líderes como Matteo Salvini, entonces viceprimer ministro italiano y líder de la Liga, y Marine Le Pen en Francia. En uno de los textos, enviado en marzo de 2019, Bannon afirma estar “centrado en recaudar fondos para Le Pen y Salvini” de cara a las elecciones europeas celebradas en mayo de ese año.

La exedil había grabado conversaciones internas que evidenciaban que algunos dirigentes desaconsejaban denunciar el acoso y aludían al posible malestar en su familia. A pesar de que el PP cuenta con protocolos para casos de acoso, la respuesta oficial ha sido centrarse en desacreditar a la denunciante, defendiendo la actuación de los cargos implicados y la presunción de inocencia del alcalde.

El jugador encarna a Arabella Greene, una botánica retirada que vive rodeada de libros, notas de investigación y un jardín lleno de posibilidades. El objetivo principal del juego es estudiar y hacer florecer una colección de plantas fantásticas, cada una con condiciones de crecimiento muy específicas que deben descubrirse a través de la observación y la experimentación.

A medida que se explora la mansión y sus terrenos, se encuentran documentos, cartas, recortes de periódico y otros objetos que contienen pistas sobre cómo cuidar cada planta, así como detalles sobre la vida y la carrera científica de Arabella. Cada puzle se basa en lógica ambiental: entender la época, el clima, la orientación del sol o incluso dispositivos de la casa para recrear el entorno adecuado en el que cada planta puede prosperar.

La iniciativa busca beneficiar a personas procesadas por delitos políticos, excluyendo los delitos graves como violaciones de derechos humanos, crímenes de lesa humanidad, homicidio intencional, corrupción y tráfico de drogas. Durante el debate, el presidente del Parlamento, Jorge Rodríguez, sostuvo que pedían perdón a los presos políticos y abogó por la reconciliación, afirmando: “Pedimos perdón porque, lo digo con claridad, a mí no me gustan los presos”.

El proyecto establece un proceso de consultas con la sociedad, dirigido por una comisión presidida por Jorge Arreaza e integrada por otros diputados, incluyendo a Nicolás Maduro Guerra e Iris Varela.

La negativa se produjo en el último día de entrevistas antes de la jornada de reflexión, en un espacio de 15 minutos fijado por la Junta Electoral Central en función de los resultados obtenidos por el partido en los anteriores comicios.

Según explicó la propia Intxaurrondo al cierre del programa, Azcón decidió no acudir a la entrevista pese a que otros candidatos, como la socialista Pilar Alegría, sí participaron en el mismo formato.

Aunque Starmer nunca conoció personalmente a Epstein, su decisión de nombrar a Mandelson como embajador del Reino Unido en Estados Unidos en 2024 —a pesar de estar al tanto de sus vínculos con Epstein— ha provocado fuertes críticas incluso dentro de su propio Partido Laborista. Documentos recientemente publicados muestran que Mandelson no solo mantuvo una relación con Epstein tras la condena de este último, sino que además podría haber compartido información sensible mientras ocupaba cargos políticos, lo que ha agravado aún más la situación.

En su mensaje, Alexander Soros subraya que, frente a otros dirigentes que eluden los grandes retos, el presidente español opta por abordarlos de manera directa.

Mientras que el FBI interpretó la figura como 'posiblemente un recluso', el informe de la Oficina del Inspector General indicó que podría tratarse de un funcionario de prisiones transportando ropa o sábanas. Estas discrepancias han generado debates sobre la cronología de los hechos y la supervisión de los guardias, ya que los registros muestran fallos en los conteos de presos y en los controles de bienestar de Epstein.

En lugar de responder al fondo de la cuestión, Serrano replicó con una frase personal y despectiva —“¿Y tú cómo ligas?”— que desvió el foco del asunto y generó críticas por su tono y falta de respeto.

La pregunta hacía referencia a la denuncia presentada por una exconcejala del Ayuntamiento de Móstoles, que acusa al alcalde de acoso laboral y sexual. Ante este contexto, Serrano no solo evitó valorar los hechos concretos, sino que defendió de manera cerrada a su partido y al regidor municipal.

El tono y el contenido del mensaje han generado una inmediata reacción política y social.

Pablo Iglesias respondió públicamente denunciando la gravedad de los hechos y señalando que las amenazas proceden, según sus palabras, de alguien al frente de un grupo de 'matones profesionales' con antecedentes por agresiones.

La Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (Aemet) ha advertido de precipitaciones muy abundantes en comunidades donde el suelo ya se encuentra saturado, lo que aumenta de forma significativa el riesgo de inundaciones y crecidas de ríos.

El contexto atmosférico viene marcado por un chorro polar especialmente activo y desplazado hacia latitudes más bajas de lo habitual, un patrón que está facilitando la llegada continua de borrascas desde el Atlántico. Este flujo dominante de vientos del oeste y suroeste arrastra aire muy húmedo, provocando lluvias persistentes y, en algunos momentos, de carácter intenso.

Desde diciembre, el país no recibe suministros regulares de gasolina y diésel, lo que ha provocado apagones prolongados, el colapso del transporte público y un aumento generalizado del malestar social. En La Habana, considerada una de las zonas menos afectadas, los cortes eléctricos alcanzan entre 12 y 14 horas diarias, mientras que en el oriente del país algunas provincias apenas disponen de seis horas de electricidad al día.

La falta de combustible ha obligado al Gobierno a racionar la venta de gasolina, que ahora se comercializa exclusivamente en dólares y con un límite estricto de 40 litros por usuario.

Esta medida afecta a clientes de compañías como Movistar, Vodafone, Orange o Digi, incluidas sus marcas secundarias, y estará vigente hasta el final de la temporada, fijado en mayo de 2026.

La autorización judicial se apoya en el funcionamiento técnico de Ace Stream, una plataforma basada en tecnología P2P similar a BitTorrent, en la que los usuarios no solo consumen el contenido, sino que también contribuyen a su distribución al actuar como pares dentro de la red. Según el auto, incluso de forma inconsciente, cada espectador puede formar parte del entramado técnico que facilita la difusión de contenidos no autorizados, lo que ha servido a LaLiga como argumento p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-permite-identificar-ips-por-ace-stream-pero-aclara-que-ver-futbol-pirata-no-implica-automaticamente-delito</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-juez-permite-identificar-ips-por-ace-stream-pero-aclara-que-ver-futbol-pirata-no-implica-automaticamente-delito</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 16:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Detalles del DLC Poison Retro Set para Pixel Gun 3D en Epic Games Store]]></title><description><![CDATA[Poison Retro Set es un contenido descargable para el juego free to play Pixel Gun 3D que añade un conjunto de armas con estética retro y un potente efecto de veneno al arsenal del jugador.

Esta medida, tomada en el contexto de las crecientes tensiones en Gaza y la inestabilidad en el Medio Oriente, abarca sectores clave como la tecnología, infraestructura y bienes raíces. Beijing está tomando esta decisión debido a la incertidumbre sobre la seguridad de las inversiones en una región marcada por conflictos prolongados y amenazas de actores como Irán y Hezbollah. Las relaciones comerciales entre China e Israel se habían estrechado en la última década, especialmente en áreas como ciberseguridad, tecnología avanzada y agricultura. Sin embargo, la presión de Estados Unidos por la transferencia de tecnología sensible a China y la crisis humanitaria en Gaza han complicado estas relaciones.

El autor sostiene que la supuesta publicación masiva de millones de archivos vinculados a Epstein habría revelado una red global de abusos sexuales, chantaje y control político que implicaría a gran parte de las élites occidentales, incluidos dirigentes estadounidenses, empresarios tecnológicos y casas reales europeas. Según esta tesis, el escándalo habría provocado una crisis moral irreversible en Estados Unidos y en lo que denomina el “Occidente colectivo”.

El artículo afirma que Donald Trump habría utilizado inicialmente la promesa de desclasificar los archivos como arma electoral, para después intentar minimizar o encubrir su contenido, lo que habría generado una fractura interna en el movimiento MAGA.

En esas conversaciones privadas, mantenidas en la sede de la Vicepresidencia del Gobierno de Aragón durante el primer semestre de 2024, se plantea abiertamente la posibilidad de que el presidente autonómico, Jorge Azcón, pudiera recolocar a dirigentes de Vox en otras responsabilidades una vez abandonado el Ejecutivo.

En los audios, Nolasco pregunta de forma directa a su entorno de confianza si Azcón aceptaría colocar a personas afines “donde él quisiera”, recibiendo como respuesta que cualquier movimiento sería fruto de una negociación y no de una obediencia automática.

La noticia destaca que, mientras Abascal se presenta como un firme defensor de España, no dudó en mostrar simpatía hacia un magnate extranjero que critica al propio Gobierno español. Los usuarios de Twitter cuestionaron sus motivaciones y le acusaron de intentar ganar notoriedad internacional a costa de criticar a su propio país. La reacción de Abascal fue interpretada por muchos como un gesto de 'lamebotismo' hacia Musk, y varios tuiteros no tardaron en expresar su descontento con comentarios irónicos y críticos. Esta situación vuelve a poner de manifiesto las contradicciones del discurso ultraderechista, que promueve un patriotismo muy marcado pero que, según los críticos, se desdibuja cuando se trata de figuras extranjeras con poder.

El interés norteamericano por ambos territorios se explica por razones estratégicas más que económicas, especialmente en el contexto de la Primera Guerra Mundial y la reciente apertura del Canal de Panamá, que incrementó el valor geopolítico del Caribe.

Las Islas Vírgenes, colonizadas sucesivamente por varias potencias europeas, pasaron a manos danesas en el siglo XVII y se integraron en un sistema colonial basado en plantaciones de azúcar sostenidas por mano de obra esclava. Tras la abolición de la esclavitud y el hundimiento de ese modelo económico, el archipiélago se convirtió en una carga para Dinamarca. Estados Unidos mostró interés desde mediados del siglo XIX, temiendo que otras potencias europeas, especialmente Alemania, se adelantaran en su control.

El Calendario Meteorológico se publica anualmente y no responde al formato de un calendario convencional.

Según el análisis, la semana del 9 al 15 de febrero estará marcada por la continuidad de la llegada de borrascas atlánticas, lo que se traducirá en un episodio lluvioso en gran parte de la Península. Galicia será la comunidad más afectada por las precipitaciones, mientras que en el área mediterránea y en los archipiélagos las lluvias serán, en caso de producirse, más débiles y dispersas.

Además de las precipitaciones, esta primera semana destacará por unas temperaturas claramente superiores a la media habitual para esta época del año en la práctica totalidad del territorio peninsular, consolidando una tendencia de ambiente suave que ya se viene observando en semanas anteriores.

Este acto ha sido duramente criticado por líderes políticos y usuarios en redes sociales, quienes lo consideran un acto racista, especialmente durante el mes de la Historia Negra. Gobernadores y usuarios en plataformas como X (antes Twitter) han exigido una condena de la acción. Además, algunos especulan que la publicación podría haber sido la causa de una caída temporal de Truth Social.

El texto, publicado en Menéame dentro de una comunidad gastronómica, reivindica la cocina popular y de subsistencia, destacando su valor cultural, emocional y culinario.

La autora explica la elaboración de los tortos desde una perspectiva práctica y doméstica, sin medidas exactas, siguiendo el método tradicional “a ojo”. Los ingredientes básicos son harina de maíz, agua tibia y sal, trabajados hasta lograr una textura similar a la plastilina. Se detallan trucos para conseguir una masa manejable, estirarla correctamente y darle forma uniforme antes de cocinarla directamente sobre la chapa, tal y como se hacía históricamente.

El acompañamiento, denominado coloquialmente “la chicha”, consiste en un sofrito de cebolla con rebozuelos, nueces para aportar textura, nata y queso azul, hasta obtener una salsa cremosa.

Arrién destacó las dificultades que vivió durante todo el proceso debido a la actitud de la actriz, que, según él, no siguió sus consejos y saboteó el procedimiento con sus decisiones impulsivas. Además, comentó que la Fiscalía probablemente archive el caso por la debilidad de las pruebas, ya que la retirada de la denuncia por parte de Mouliaá ha debilitado considerablemente el caso.

La ficción, compuesta por ocho capítulos, aborda de forma cruda y directa el auge de la extrema derecha y sus efectos sobre una democracia debilitada. La historia sigue a Salvador, un médico madrileño que se enfrenta a un drama personal cuando descubre que su hija Milena, gravemente herida en una pelea entre hinchas de fútbol, forma parte de un grupo neonazi llamado White Souls. La serie no solo expone la violencia y la injusticia que rodea a este fenómeno político, sino que también invita al espectador a reflexionar sobre las causas que llevan a personas aparentemente pacíficas a adoptar ideas extremistas.

Desde 2008, la organización ha atendido a más de 10.000 mujeres y niñas mediante un proyecto que combina prevención, acompañamiento y atención integral, así como formación de profesionales sanitarios para la detección temprana de situaciones de riesgo. El proyecto también fomenta redes comunitarias lideradas por mujeres, como Flor de África, y grupos de jóvenes afrodescendientes, fortaleciendo su papel como agentes de cambio. La erradicación de la MGF se considera un desafío que requiere intervención comunitaria, implicación institucional y enfoque en los derechos humanos, incluyendo la reconstrucción genital y atención emocional.

Estudios recientes sobre el Parque Solar de Talatan en la meseta tibetana muestran que la instalación de paneles fotovoltaicos ha creado un microclima que protege el suelo, retiene la humedad, reduce la erosión y favorece la vegetación. Tras más de una década de funcionamiento, se ha observado un aumento del 81,4% en la fijación de arena, del 71,1% en captura de carbono, del 32,1% en retención del suelo y del 5,4% en conservación de agua. Los paneles actúan como barreras contra el viento y sombra para el suelo, permitiendo que las semillas germinen y crezcan donde antes no era posible. Esta restauración genera beneficios ecológicos que incluso se extienden más allá del perímetro de la planta. Sin embargo, los estudios destacan una desigualdad ecológica: las zonas dentro del parque son mucho más fértiles que el desierto circundante.

Mientras Wakeman llevó al extremo el uso del teclado en el rock progresivo, mostrando la capacidad narrativa de los instrumentos, De Ville ofrece una visión más moderna, utilizando el violín eléctrico para crear una pieza que fusiona riffs y melodías tensas. A través de estos dos ejemplos, se demuestra cómo el rock instrumental ha evolucionado desde su apogeo en los años 70, adaptándose a la era digital y al formato de escucha fragmentada actual, sin perder su esencia ni su poder expresivo.

Tras el impacto, que a simple vista no parece especialmente violento, la batería del vehículo quedó dañada y comenzó a generar humo rápidamente. El conductor logró salir del coche, pero no pudo abrir las puertas traseras para rescatar a los otros ocupantes debido a que los tiradores ocultos no se desplegaban.

Durante su intervención, Ayuso ha afirmado que allí donde se prohíbe el toreo “desaparece la libertad” y se ofrece una visión parcial de la cultura, subrayando que Madrid seguirá posicionándose como un referente en la defensa de la llamada Fiesta Nacional.

La presidenta ha señalado que la tauromaquia vive un “momento especial” en España, destacando el creciente interés de la juventud, a la que atribuye la búsqueda de autenticidad frente a lo que considera intentos de limitar determinadas tradiciones culturales. En este contexto, ha remarcado que el Gobierno regional continuará apoyando y fomentando los festejos taurinos, manteniendo a Madrid como “la gran casa de la tauromaquia” al servicio del conjunto del país.

Tras el escándalo protagonizado por el equipo de Noruega en el Mundial de Trondheim de 2025, donde se comprobó que varios deportistas alteraron sus trajes para ganar estabilidad y sustentación en el aire, el organismo endureció su normativa y adoptó una política de tolerancia cero frente a cualquier modificación.

En ese contexto, la FIS introdujo controles más estrictos, entre ellos la medición con escáneres 3D de la zona genital de los saltadores. Estas mediciones sirven como referencia para diseñar trajes ajustados a la morfología de cada deportista, con el objetivo de evitar prendas excesivamente holgadas o tensadas que puedan proporcionar ventajas ilegítimas durante el vuelo.

Según el investigador J. M. Ciordia, los templos clásicos no serían una creación puramente abstracta o simbólica, sino la petrificación en piedra de barcos de guerra o mercantes utilizados originalmente como refugio y techumbre. La hipótesis sostiene que elementos clave del templo, como el entablamento, los frisos con triglifos y metopas o incluso la curvatura del conjunto, derivan directamente de la estructura y el diseño de las galeras griegas.

La investigación combina arquitectura, arqueología naval, lingüística y etnografía. Uno de los puntos de partida es la similitud entre los términos griegos naus (barco) y naos (templo), cuya coincidencia formal habría sido ignorada hasta ahora por falta de una conexión material clara entre ambos conceptos.

Entre los arrestados se encuentran un notario, dos abogados que representaban legalmente a la víctima, su cuidadora y el comprador de los inmuebles. La investigación estima que los beneficios obtenidos por estas operaciones fraudulentas ascienden a unos 785.000 euros.

Según la investigación judicial, los implicados se aprovecharon de la situación de extrema vulnerabilidad de la anciana para vender todos sus bienes inmuebles en un periodo de poco más de un año, a precios muy inferiores a su valor real. Las compraventas se realizaron siempre ante el mismo notario y con el asesoramiento de los dos abogados, que incurrían en un claro conflicto de intereses al representar simultáneamente a la vendedora y a la parte compradora.

Bautista compareció ante los medios defendiendo su continuidad en el cargo y apelando a la presunción de inocencia, asegurando que seguirá trabajando por respeto a los vecinos del municipio.

El regidor sostiene que la denuncia fue investigada internamente por el PP entre octubre de 2024 y abril de 2025 y que el expediente fue archivado al no encontrarse pruebas que acreditaran los hechos. Además, subraya que la exconcejala no recurrió esa decisión ni acudió posteriormente a la vía judicial, argumento que utiliza para afirmar que no sabe de qué debe defenderse.

La investigación, publicada en la revista Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy y desarrollada en el marco de una tesis doctoral, se centra principalmente en el hepatocarcinoma, el cáncer de hígado más frecuente en adultos, aunque también analiza modelos de colangiocarcinoma y cáncer de colon.

Trabajos previos ya habían demostrado que SLU7 es esencial para el correcto funcionamiento de los hepatocitos sanos y que sus niveles disminuyen a medida que progresa la enfermedad hepática. Sin embargo, este nuevo estudio revela una paradoja relevante: aunque SLU7 se reduce durante la evolución de la enfermedad, las células tumorales conservan una cantidad mínima de esta proteína que resulta imprescindible para su supervivencia.

La decisión se enmarca en una estrategia nacional de tolerancia cero frente a los crímenes cometidos contra menores, que sitúa la integridad física y psicológica de la infancia como un valor prioritario del Estado.

Según explica, miles de ancianos murieron sin ser trasladados a hospitales, no por criterios médicos individualizados, sino por protocolos que excluían a residentes con alta dependencia o deterioro cognitivo.

El jet, un Gulfstream de 16 plazas, fue empleado al menos en dos vuelos recientes, en enero y febrero, trasladando a varios hombres palestinos desde un centro de detención en Arizona hasta Tel Aviv, con escalas técnicas en Estados Unidos y Europa.

Según el reportaje, los deportados viajaron esposados y con grilletes en tobillos y muñecas durante un trayecto de más de 12 horas.

Las grabaciones corresponden a reuniones internas del primer semestre de 2024, en las que se cuestionaba la estrategia impuesta desde Madrid de romper los pactos de gobierno con el Partido Popular en varias comunidades autónomas, incluida Aragón. Entre las voces críticas destacan Ana Pilar González del Cacho, actual jefa de gabinete de la presidenta de las Cortes aragonesas, y Alejandro Nolasco, por entonces vicepresidente del Gobierno autonómico y hoy candidato de Vox. En las conversaciones, González del Cacho llega a afirmar que Abascal 'no tiene ni puta idea' y 'es un puto basto', amenazando incluso con desafiliarse si se mantenía la línea política nacional.

José, tras ganar una oposición en Ibiza, tuvo que renunciar a ocupar su plaza porque no podía afrontar los costes de una vivienda local. Dolma, separada y con hijos, tuvo que trasladarse a Villena, Alicante, para poder adquirir una casa a un precio asequible. Según expertos, el 60% del salario familiar se destina al alquiler en Baleares, cifra que supera ampliamente la media nacional y provoca exclusión social y desigualdad.

Tras el asesinato de Alex Pretti a manos del ICE en Minneapolis, Bragg compuso 'City of heroes', un tema de dos minutos y medio que refleja su indignación y homenajea la resistencia de la comunidad local. La canción recuerda las lecciones del pasado, tomando como referencia el poema de Martin Niemöller, y llama a plantar cara a las injusticias. Desde sus primeros años, Bragg ha sido un defensor de causas sociales y políticas, apoyando desde huelgas mineras en Inglaterra hasta movimientos en Nicaragua, Escocia y Palestina. A lo largo de su carrera, ha combinado la música con el activismo, organizando conciertos solidarios y campañas como Jail Guitar Doors, que ayuda a la reinserción de presos mediante la música.

En declaraciones realizadas en el programa 'Meet the Press' de NBC, Khanna reconoció que la divulgación reciente es significativa, pero subrayó que no cumple con el compromiso de hacer públicos todos los archivos del caso. Según explicó, el Departamento de Justicia ha identificado más de seis millones de documentos, pero tras un proceso de revisión y censura solo ha liberado alrededor de 3,5 millones.

Khanna, junto con el congresista republicano Thomas Massie, ha advertido de que, si no se publican los archivos restantes, están dispuestos a impulsar procedimientos de impeachment o declarar en desacato a la fiscal general, Pam Bondi.

La obra, esculpida por el artista Alan Cottrill en Ohio, se instalará en el Trump National Doral, cerca de Miami, sede de la Cumbre del G20 que acogerá Estados Unidos los días 14 y 15 de diciembre de 2026. El objetivo principal del proyecto es promocionar el memecoin $PATRIOT. La estatua representa a Trump con el puño en alto, inspirada en una imagen tras el intento de asesinato en Butler (Pensilvania) en julio de 2024, y los encargadores pidieron al escultor 'mejorar' el aspecto del presidente, eliminando el 'cuello de pavo' y adelgazándolo para que parezca más joven. Sin embargo, existe una disputa: Cottrill retiene la pieza en su fundición porque los inversores le deben 90.000 dólares de los 150.000 acordados, alegando que usaron ilegalmente imágenes de su trabajo para promocionar la criptomoneda, cuyo valo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estatua-dorada-de-trump-de-7-metros-financiada-por-inversores-en-criptomonedas-para-promocionar-memecoin-en-el-trump-national-doral-durante-el-g20</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/estatua-dorada-de-trump-de-7-metros-financiada-por-inversores-en-criptomonedas-para-promocionar-memecoin-en-el-trump-national-doral-durante-el-g20</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mensajes de Epstein revelan los esfuerzos de Steve Bannon por financiar a partidos de extrema derecha en Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[Los archivos recientemente publicados de Jeffrey Epstein han revelado detalles sobre los intentos del exasesor de Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, de influir en la política europea a través de apoyo financiero a partidos de extrema derecha. Los mensajes, fechados principalmente entre 2018 y 2019, muestran a Bannon buscando el respaldo de Epstein para fortalecer a líderes como Matteo Salvini en Italia y Marine Le Pen en Francia, así como para promover el crecimiento de fuerzas ultraderechistas en Alemania, Polonia, Suecia y Austria. En algunos correos se evidencia que Bannon viajaba por Europa con la intención de unir a estos grupos en un movimiento euroescéptico. No hay evidencia de que Salvini tuviera relación directa con Epstein ni participación en su red de tráfico sexual, aunque su nombre aparece varias veces en los intercambios.

Esta zona, aislada durante siglos por montañas escarpadas y su estructura de clanes patrilineales, presenta una notable preservación genética única en Europa continental.

Los resultados muestran que alrededor del 80 % de los linajes paternos pertenecen al haplogrupo J-M172 (específicamente subclados como J-L930), común en la antigüedad griega pero poco frecuente en otras partes de Europa actual. Muchos de estos linajes se remontan a un ancestro común del siglo VII a.C., lo que indica episodios graves de reducción demográfica por epidemias, guerras e inestabilidad política a lo largo de la historia.

Por el lado materno (ADN mitocondrial), se detectan al menos 30 linajes diferentes procedentes de áreas cercanas, lo que sugiere contactos]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-genetico-confirma-la-continuidad-ancestral-desde-la-edad-del-bronce-en-la-poblacion-aislada-de-deep-mani-grecia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-genetico-confirma-la-continuidad-ancestral-desde-la-edad-del-bronce-en-la-poblacion-aislada-de-deep-mani-grecia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Presidente del Gobierno español Pedro Sánchez sobre el rearme de Europa]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra una entrevista con el Presidente del Gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, donde aborda temas relacionados con el rearme de Europa, la situación geopolítica actual, la guerra en Ucrania, la necesidad de inversión en defensa, y el papel de España en el contexto europeo y global.

La sentencia, dictada por la sala de lo contencioso-administrativo, respalda el criterio de la Agencia Tributaria y concluye que el holding del cineasta intentó compensar de forma indebida las pérdidas de una empresa integrada en el grupo, lo que suponía un doble aprovechamiento fiscal no permitido por la normativa.

El caso se remonta a una inspección iniciada en 2013 sobre AE William Holding, conglomerado que agrupa varias sociedades vinculadas a la actividad cinematográfica de Segura, entre ellas Amiguetes Entertainment, productora de la saga Torrente.

Según las primeras informaciones, las jóvenes se encontraban muy afectadas después de que sus padres les hubieran retirado el teléfono móvil. De acuerdo con la reconstrucción inicial, las hermanas se habrían encerrado en el balcón del domicilio familiar antes de precipitarse al vacío. Los gritos alertaron a los padres y a algunos vecinos del edificio, pero cuando lograron acceder al balcón ya no pudieron evitar el desenlace.

El nivel del agua ha alcanzado los 1,8 metros sobre el nivel del mar y continúa aumentando a un ritmo acelerado, con previsiones de superar los 1,9 metros en las próximas horas, lo que está unificando grandes áreas en una única lámina de agua de unas 30.000 hectáreas.

Desde el punto de vista ecológico, este episodio tiene efectos mayoritariamente positivos a corto plazo.

Utilizando la técnica DIPA-CRISPR, desarrollada previamente por el mismo grupo en 2022 para inactivar genes mediante inyección en el abdomen de la hembra, los investigadores han realizado una inserción (knock-in) fusionando el gen distal-less (clave en el desarrollo embrionario) con el marcador fluorescente rojo mCherry. Esta modificación se ha logrado con éxito en alrededor del 30 % de las hembras inyectadas, permitiendo observar en vivo y en tiempo real la expresión de la proteína Dll en apéndices y sistema nervioso durante el desarrollo embrionario, sin alterar el crecimiento normal del insecto.

Esta megaestructura consiste en un anillo artificial construido alrededor de una estrella, con un radio similar a la órbita terrestre y una superficie habitable millones de veces mayor que la de la Tierra. Aunque la idea fascinó a lectores y científicos, pronto generó críticas técnicas, especialmente tras la publicación de la novela en 1970.

El principal problema señalado es la inestabilidad gravitatoria inherente a un anillo orbital de este tipo. A diferencia de una órbita planetaria, el equilibrio del anillo es inestable: cualquier perturbación mínima —ya sea una asimetría estructural, el impacto de un meteorito o la influencia gravitatoria de otros cuerpos— tendería a crecer hasta provocar la colisión del anillo con la estrella central. Mantenerlo centrado sería tan difícil como equilibrar un lápiz sobre su punta.

En la actualidad, su valor ha caído por debajo de los 71.000 dólares, situándose incluso por debajo del precio que tenía antes de que Trump regresara a la presidencia.

Las pérdidas se han acelerado recientemente: un 8% en un solo día, un 20% en una semana y casi la mitad de su valor en el último trimestre.

Según expone el sindicato MATS, la central de esterilización está actualmente gestionada por la empresa Croma Servicios y Productos, tras la externalización del servicio. Diversos documentos internos indicarían que esta empresa estaría esterilizando material de la compañía privada Sanitas utilizando las instalaciones públicas del hospital madrileño.

Según advierte el sector eléctrico, numerosos puntos de la red de transporte y distribución se encuentran cerca del 90% de ocupación, lo que deja muy poco margen para atender el crecimiento de la demanda previsto en los próximos años. Este problema no responde únicamente a la falta de capacidad teórica, sino a la lentitud en la ejecución de infraestructuras y a rigideces administrativas que impiden reaccionar con rapidez ante nuevos focos de consumo.

Las empresas eléctricas critican que Red Eléctrica de España (REE) ha invertido durante años por debajo del máximo permitido y que los procesos de planificación y autorización de nuevas infraestructuras se alargan excesivamente. Como consecuencia, proyectos de vivienda, digitalización e industria se encuentran con una red que, en ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-saturacion-de-la-red-electrica-limita-nuevas-conexiones-y-obliga-a-cambios-urgentes-en-la-planificacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-saturacion-de-la-red-electrica-limita-nuevas-conexiones-y-obliga-a-cambios-urgentes-en-la-planificacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 21:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telegram y Moncloa debaten la nueva ley de redes sociales y la protección de menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[El fundador de Telegram, Pável Dúrov, se ha sumado a las críticas de Elon Musk hacia la nueva ley de redes sociales propuesta por Pedro Sánchez, que prohibiría el acceso a redes a menores de 16 años y aumentaría la responsabilidad de las plataformas sobre contenidos ilegales o perjudiciales. Dúrov argumenta que la normativa podría comprometer la privacidad de los usuarios, generar una recopilación masiva de datos y fomentar la sobrecensura, limitando la libertad de expresión y el periodismo. Por su parte, la Moncloa defiende la ley como un mecanismo para garantizar la transparencia en la moderación de contenidos y proteger a los menores frente a la manipulación algorítmica, señalando además los problemas legales previos de Telegram en Francia debido a la falta de moderación. La Comisión Europea ha aclarado que no corresponde responsabilizar a los CEO de las plataformas y recuerda que la Ley de Servicios Digitales de la UE busca armonizar la protección de los menores de edad.

El autor sostiene que estas plataformas ya no cumplen ninguna función social positiva sin estar contaminada por vigilancia masiva, manipulación algorítmica y polarización deliberada. Lejos de conectar a las personas o fortalecer la democracia, se han convertido en sistemas de extracción de datos al servicio de intereses económicos colosales.

Dans apoya su argumentación en estudios que sitúan a Facebook, Instagram y otras aplicaciones de Meta entre las más invasivas en términos de recopilación y compartición de datos, subrayando que este saqueo no es un efecto secundario, sino el núcleo del negocio.

La traducción de Rodrigo Guijarro Lasheras y su estudio justifican por sí solos la edición de KRK, destacando la complejidad y ambición de la obra. Crumey, físico teórico y matemático, utiliza recursos postmodernos, intertextualidad y narración múltiple, y su literatura mezcla ciencia, música, filosofía y literatura, creando un diálogo sutil entre el texto y la experiencia del lector. La reseña enfatiza que el valor de la novela no reside únicamente en la historia o los personajes, sino en cómo plantea la realidad como una narrativa postmoderna y cómo combina elementos de física cuántica, distopía y literatura clásica. Además, se contextualiza su obra dentro del panorama editorial español, señalando interrupciones en la publicación de sus siguientes novelas y destacando la importancia de contar con traductores competentes.

El 76 % de los adultos encuestados afirma sentirse más preocupado por el futuro del país que antes, destacando el estrés por la división política, la incertidumbre económica, la inflación, el aumento de costes en vivienda, sanidad y alimentación, la soledad y la exposición constante a negatividad en redes sociales.

En diciembre, la presidenta madrileña reprochó a la izquierda la falta de contundencia ante acusaciones de acoso, utilizando el caso Salazar para acusar al PSOE de no proteger a las mujeres y de normalizar conductas machistas en su entorno político.

Sin embargo, cuando una edil del PP de Móstoles denunció haber sufrido acoso sexual y laboral por parte del alcalde del municipio, Manuel Bautista, Ayuso no la recibió ni respondió a sus escritos, a pesar de que la concejala intentó durante meses obtener su apoyo. En lugar de ello, la presidenta sí citó al alcalde denunciado pocos días después de conocer los hechos.

La polémica surge al conocerse que la madre de sus dos hijas es beneficiaria de uno de los pisos de la primera promoción de vivienda protegida construida en la ciudad en los últimos 20 años, ubicada en un solar municipal especialmente cotizado, cercano a la playa de San Juan y dotado de servicios como piscina y pistas de pádel.

Las viviendas, un total de 140, fueron adjudicadas a un precio medio de 215.000 euros, aproximadamente la mitad de su valor de mercado, lo que ha generado una fuerte controversia política y social.

El juez analiza de forma individualizada las cuatro faltas imputadas y pone especial énfasis en la ocurrida el 29 de noviembre de 2024, cuando la trabajadora tuvo que acudir de urgencia al veterinario ante el empeoramiento crítico del estado de salud de su animal, al que finalmente se le practicó la eutanasia.

Las autoridades han organizado un desalojo escalonado y han trasladado a los vecinos a alojamientos provisionales.

El temporal ha provocado el corte de más de 140 carreteras en todo el país, muchas de ellas en Andalucía, incluidas vías principales como la A-44 y la A-48.

Dicha conversación, que incluía referencias a presuntas cuentas bancarias y diálogos atribuidos al expresidente José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, fue negada rotundamente por ambas partes implicadas y nunca tuvo lugar.

Originalmente, 'facha' proviene de 'fascista', un concepto político que surgió en la Italia de Mussolini a comienzos del siglo XX. El fascismo fue un movimiento autoritario, ultranacionalista y totalitario que negaba las libertades individuales, controlaba todos los ámbitos de la sociedad y normalizaba la violencia como herramienta política. Reducir esta palabra a un insulto cotidiano empobrece el debate, pues hace difícil identificar comportamientos autoritarios reales.

El tribunal reconoció que hubo contactos entre López Madrid y Villarejo y que incluso un socio del comisario acompañó al empresario al centro de trabajo de Pinto, pero no se demostró que existiera un pago o dádiva a cambio, ni que López Madrid supiera que Villarejo estaba en activo como comisario.

Feijóo aseguró que el partido realizó una investigación sobre los hechos ocurridos en 2024 y que estos fueron considerados no probados. Reiteró que la vía judicial sigue abierta para la denunciante si desea reclamar justicia. Además, Feijóo vinculó irónicamente la publicación de la noticia con la campaña electoral en Aragón y con la comparecencia del exasesor de Pedro Sánchez, Francisco Salazar, también acusado de acoso, subrayando diferencias en los tiempos y en la gestión de las denuncias. El líder popular defendió que, según los Estatutos del partido, la investigación en Madrid se realizó de manera veraz, se notificó a las personas implicadas y se remitió al Comité de Derechos y Garantías para su seguimiento.

Desde una perspectiva académica y comparativa, se argumenta que el franquismo ofrece un marco histórico útil para comprender cómo se consolidan los sistemas autoritarios más allá de los modelos clásicos asociados al nazismo.

El texto repasa el ascenso del franquismo a partir de un contexto de crisis económica y política, el papel central del nacionalismo excluyente, la alianza con la Iglesia católica y la utilización del miedo al 'enemigo interno' para justificar la represión. Se subraya cómo el régimen debilitó la resistencia social mediante el control de los cuerpos, especialmente de las mujeres, restringiendo derechos reproductivos y reforzando roles tradicionales como parte de una estrategia de reproducción ideológica.

En aquel momento, Podemos había irrumpido con fuerza en el Congreso con 69 escaños y más del 20% de los votos, mientras Ciudadanos también obtenía relevancia pero sin capacidad para pactos mayoritarios con el PP o PSOE.

Los resultados principales indican que un mayor consumo acumulado de cannabis se asocia de forma general con volúmenes mayores en varias regiones cerebrales clave (especialmente aquellas con alta densidad de receptores CB1, como el hipocampo) y con un mejor desempeño en pruebas cognitivas relacionadas con memoria, aprendizaje, velocidad de procesamiento, atención y funciones ejecutivas.

A través del lenguaje visual y del humor, la pieza reflexiona sobre los mecanismos de manipulación de la opinión pública en el contexto actual, marcado por el auge de la ultraderecha, la centralidad de las redes sociales y el poder creciente de grandes plataformas digitales.

La ilustración apunta de manera directa a figuras y dinámicas reconocibles del debate público contemporáneo, como el papel de líderes políticos de la ultraderecha —entre ellos Santiago Abascal— y la influencia de magnates tecnológicos como Elon Musk en el ecosistema informativo. La viñeta sugiere cómo discursos simplificados, emocionalmente cargados y amplificados algorítmicamente pueden moldear percepciones colectivas, desplazar debates complejos y normalizar marcos ideológicos extremos.

Quiles, conocido por perseguir a cargos públicos con preguntas provocadoras fuera de contextos informativos convencionales, increpó a Iglesias en plena calle utilizando argumentos habituales de la extrema derecha, como la teoría del “gran reemplazo”, y ataques personales relacionados con su trayectoria política y profesional.

Durante el encuentro, Quiles lanzó preguntas sobre supuestas declaraciones de Irene Montero y sobre el futuro político de Iglesias, insistiendo en un tono provocador mientras grababa la escena para difundirla posteriormente en redes sociales. Ante esta situación, Iglesias respondió de forma airada, calificando a Quiles de “fascista” y “cerdo”, e intentando apartar el micrófono del canal Estado de Alarma, medio vinculado a Javier Negre.

Sin embargo, la interpretación resultó ser incorrecta y rápidamente llamó la atención de quienes conocen mínimamente la geografía gaditana.

El Puente Carranza no es una autovía urbana, sino la carretera CA-36, con un carril por sentido y otro reversible, y atraviesa directamente la Bahía de Cádiz. Al estar construido sobre el mar, no existen cunetas ni márgenes terrestres que puedan inundarse: los laterales y la parte inferior del puente están permanentemente rodeados de agua salada.

El proyecto surge de años de trabajo comunitario y de apoyo mutuo en el barrio, donde el problema de la vivienda se identificó como el principal factor de precariedad.

El autor no idealiza el pasado, pero defiende que crecer en un entorno imperfecto enseñaba a desarrollar criterio, instinto y resiliencia, algo que considera en peligro con las políticas de “riesgo cero”.

Arjona cuestiona que la prohibición sea una medida de salud pública basada en evidencias sólidas. Apoyándose en estudios recientes y en las tesis del psiquiatra Sami Timimi, sostiene que existe una tendencia a simplificar problemas complejos mediante soluciones rápidas y efectistas, lo que denomina la “McDonaldización de la salud mental”.

La obra, de grandes dimensiones, había perdido su rastro durante décadas y su localización se produjo en el marco de una investigación iniciada tras detectarse una pintura cuyo paradero no estaba claro durante una exposición organizada por la propia Casa de Alba entre 2023 y 2024.

Según testimonios recogidos por el diario INFORMACIÓN, parte de esas operaciones incluían pagos en dinero negro que superaban los 200.000 euros, una práctica destinada a burlar la normativa que regula la vivienda de protección pública.

La defensa de Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso, ha solicitado el pago de cerca de 65.000 euros por los honorarios de su abogado. Corresponde a la letrada de la Administración de Justicia del Tribunal Supremo fijar la cuantía, aunque previsiblemente será impugnada por el condenado.

En estos casos es habitual solicitar un dictamen orientativo al ICAM, un informe que no es vinculante pero sí influyente. Sin embargo, el artículo sostiene que el ICAM no puede considerarse un actor neutral, ya que fue precisamente esta institución la que impulsó la querella inicial contra García Ortíz en marzo de 2024 y ejerció la acusación popular durante el proceso, llegando a solicitar penas de cárcel e inhabilitació]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-icam-y-su-conflicto-de-intereses-en-la-fijacion-de-las-costas-del-caso-del-exfiscal-general-del-estado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-icam-y-su-conflicto-de-intereses-en-la-fijacion-de-las-costas-del-caso-del-exfiscal-general-del-estado</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El TJUE anula la retirada de inmunidad a Puigdemont, Comín y Ponsatí por falta de imparcialidad del ponente vinculado al grupo de Vox]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea (TJUE) ha revocado este 5 de febrero de 2026 las decisiones del Parlamento Europeo que, en 2021, levantaron la inmunidad parlamentaria de Carles Puigdemont, Toni Comín y Clara Ponsatí como eurodiputados. El motivo principal es que el ponente designado para evaluar los suplicatorios del juez Pablo Llarena pertenecía al mismo grupo político que Vox, partido que ejerció la acusación popular en el juicio por el procés y el 1-O. El TJUE considera que esta circunstancia vulneró el derecho a un tratamiento imparcial y equitativo, ya que se incumplió la regla interna del Parlamento de evitar ponentes con afinidades políticas que puedan generar dudas legítimas sobre su neutralidad. El fallo corrige la sentencia previa del Tribunal General de la UE, que había avalado la retirada de inmunidad, y contradice también la propuesta del abogado general Maciej Szpunar, quien recomendaba rechazar los recursos.

El texto sostiene que dichos documentos describen una red de abusos sexuales sistemáticos, violencia extrema y chantaje que afectaría a sectores muy amplios de las élites políticas, económicas y mediáticas de Occidente. Según el autor, existirían evidencias fotográficas y audiovisuales de torturas y abusos, así como correos electrónicos en los que Epstein y sus contactos aludirían a prácticas criminales graves, incluidas amenazas de muerte.

El artículo afirma que las víctimas de la red de Epstein podrían ascender a más de un millar de menores y subraya que las autoridades judiciales y policiales habrían conocido estos hechos desde los años noventa, sin actuar en consecuencia.

Este resultado, que ha despertado un enorme interés científico y social, abre la puerta a futuros ensayos clínicos en humanos, previstos dentro de dos o tres años. Sin embargo, el principal obstáculo para dar ese paso es la falta de financiación suficiente.

El coste mínimo estimado para iniciar los ensayos clínicos en humanos asciende a unos 30 millones de euros, una cantidad que no está cubierta por los actuales Presupuestos Generales del Estado. Aunque el CNIO recibió en 2023 un total de 36,5 millones de euros en subvenciones públicas, estos fondos se destinan a la actividad global del centro, que desarrolla decenas de proyectos simultáneos, y no de forma exclusiva al estudio de Barbacid.

Según los documentos difundidos, Gil-Casares intercambió correos electrónicos y mensajes con Epstein desde 2017 hasta pocos meses antes de la muerte de este en agosto de 2019.

La policía francesa investigó el lugar y halló un complejo sistema tecnológico que permitía interceptar datos satelitales, incluyendo información de la red Starlink, utilizada en comunicaciones críticas y posibles aplicaciones militares. Cuatro hombres de nacionalidad china fueron detenidos, acusados de delitos relacionados con la ciberdelincuencia y el suministro de información a una potencia extranjera.

Destaca cómo Uclés, pese a su éxito y proyección, ha decidido boicotear unas jornadas sobre la Guerra Civil organizadas por Arturo Pérez-Reverte, tituladas '1936. La guerra que todos perdimos'. Uclés se niega a compartir cartel con figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros, a quienes considera inadecuados, y rechaza el lema del evento por considerarlo falso y complaciente con la derecha revisionista, ya que argumenta que la guerra no la perdieron todos, sino que la ganaron los franquistas y la sufrieron especialmente los republicanos.

Lo que debía haber sido un momento de celebración se vio empañado por una oleada de insultos y ataques personales en redes sociales, motivados por el idioma que utilizó en una entrevista posterior a la competición. Delago habló en ladino, su lengua materna, durante una conversación con RAI Ladinia, el canal público italiano que emite íntegramente en este idioma.

Los comentarios ofensivos, lanzados principalmente por usuarios anónimos o los llamados “leones de teclado”, incluían mensajes como “si representas a Italia, habla italiano” o insultos de carácter xenófobo.

Inicialmente, Bezos mantuvo la independencia editorial y permitió que el medio realizara un periodismo crítico y de calidad, convirtiéndose en un referente durante la presidencia de Donald Trump. Sin embargo, con el tiempo, intervenciones directas en decisiones editoriales y cambios estratégicos destinados a la rentabilidad llevaron a despidos masivos y a la eliminación de secciones clave como noticias locales, deportes y corresponsalías internacionales. La publicación perdió suscriptores y buena parte de su identidad como periódico independiente y local. El artículo destaca la paradoja de que, a pesar de contar con una fortuna personal colosal, Bezos optó por sacrificar la esencia del medio en lugar de asumir pérdidas económicas, lo que contrasta con la dedicación de históricos magnates de la prensa como William Randolph Hearst.

En lugar de centrarse en cuestiones de competencia, Hawley dedicó buena parte de su turno a atacar el contenido de la plataforma, especialmente la presencia de personajes y temáticas trans en programas dirigidos al público infantil.

Hawley acusó a Netflix de promover lo que denominó una “ideología transgénero”, llegando a afirmar, sin aportar pruebas, que casi la mitad de los contenidos infantiles de la plataforma impulsan esta supuesta agenda. El codirector ejecutivo de Netflix, Ted Sarandos, negó rotundamente esas cifras y calificó los datos de inexactos, señalando que no sabía de dónde procedían.

Estos mecanismos actuaban como filtro inicial antes del visado final por parte de la Conselleria. La normativa anterior pretendía garantizar transparencia y evitar fraudes en la adjudicación.

La Conselleria de Vivienda defiende el cambio argumentando que separa mejor los demandantes de promoción pública y privada (con perfiles y rentas distintos), y que el nuevo decreto refuerza los controles en la fase de visado, incluyendo autorizaciones para verificar datos tributarios y económicos con otras administraciones.

Durante el juicio celebrado en la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, los dos acusados reconocieron haber insultado y acosado verbalmente a la víctima, aunque negaron haberle golpeado directamente y atribuyeron los puñetazos a un tercer amigo.

Expertas en sociología y psicología del trabajo destacan que este modelo disminuye el agotamiento crónico (burnout), ya que un tercer día de descanso permite una desconexión real que la jornada tradicional de 40 horas no garantiza. Además, las trabajadoras que experimentan bienestar emocional son un 15% más productivas y tienen un 40% menos de bajas por ansiedad.

Aunque nació como una herramienta para garantizar el acceso a la vivienda a hogares de ingresos bajos y medios, la reducción sostenida de su producción y la flexibilización de los requisitos de acceso han ido desdibujando su función social. En un contexto de crisis residencial y subida generalizada de precios, las VPO son cada vez menos y están dirigidas a rentas más altas.

Desde 1991 se han construido cerca de 1,7 millones de viviendas protegidas en España, pero muchas de ellas han perdido con el tiempo su calificación y han pasado al mercado libre, contribuyendo a la escalada de precios. La producción actual está en mínimos históricos: en 1995 se concedieron más VPO que en todo el periodo comprendido entre 2017 y 2025.

Además del pago de la fianza, el magistrado ha impuesto varias medidas cautelares, entre ellas la prohibición de salir de España, la retirada del pasaporte y la obligación de comparecer semanalmente ante el juzgado.

La detención de Francisco de Borbón se enmarca en una investigación más amplia iniciada en 2024, cuando fue arrestado Óscar Sánchez Gil, inspector jefe de la UDEF, al que se le atribuye haber ocultado en su domicilio cerca de 20 millones de euros. Según la investigación judicial, Sánchez Gil habría utilizado su posición dentro de la Policía Nacional para facilitar información y ofrecer protección a redes de narcotráfico a cambio de comisiones, participando posteriormente en el blanqueo de los beneficios obtenidos.

Según la información disponible, los chalecos ofertados por la empresa adjudicataria están fabricados en Israel, lo que plantea dudas relevantes sobre la legalidad de la operación.

El contrato se tramitó mediante un procedimiento abierto simplificado y abreviado.

Los archivos, difundidos a finales de enero de 2026, incluyen correos electrónicos y testimonios sin verificar que mencionan situaciones extremas, lo que ha servido de detonante para reactivar viejas teorías de la conspiración.

Entre los nombres citados en los documentos figuran empresarios y personalidades públicas de distintos países, lo que ha incrementado el interés mediático y la circulación de interpretaciones especulativas. En este contexto, ha resurgido un episodio ocurrido en México en 2009 protagonizado por Gabriela Rico Jiménez, una joven que, durante una crisis nerviosa frente a un hotel de lujo en Monterrey, realizó graves acusaciones contra miembros de las élites políticas y empresariales, llegando a afirmar la existencia de asesinatos rituales y canibalismo.

Rego argumentó que X se ha convertido en un entorno en el que se producen vulneraciones graves y reiteradas de derechos fundamentales, lo que, a su juicio, justifica la necesidad de una intervención más contundente por parte de los poderes públicos.

Esta zona contenía tumbas de decenas de soldados británicos, australianos y otros aliados caídos en la Primera y Segunda Guerra Mundial. Las fotos muestran movimientos de tierra sistemáticos en la esquina suroeste, con eliminación de lápidas, remoción de capa superior del suelo y creación de un gran montículo de tierra como barrera, visibles desde agosto y más evidentes en diciembre de 2025. El antiguo cuidador del cementerio, Essam Jaradah, confirmó dos operaciones de bulldozado: una externa con olivos y otra interna de casi 1.000 m² en la zona de tumbas australianas, realizada probablemente entre abril y mayo tras la retirada israelí.

Ortiz, que se había fugado a Venezuela tras cometer los crímenes, cumplía una condena de 30 años allí hasta que fue repatriado a Estados Unidos junto a otros presos políticos. La promoción de la entrevista emitida por Telemundo ha generado indignación entre las familias de las víctimas, ya que la cadena se cuestiona si Ortiz es víctima o asesino, lo que ha sido considerado insensible y doloroso por los afectados. En el adelanto, Ortiz afirma haber sido torturado en prisión y se muestra con gafas de sol y gorra estadounidense en un entorno ajardinado.

El suceso ocurrió el lunes por la noche en un tren regional que cubría la ruta entre Kaiserslautern y Saarbrücken, en el suroeste del país, según informó la compañía ferroviaria Deutsche Bahn (DB).

Durante un control rutinario de billetes, el revisor, identificado como Serkan C., detectó que un joven de 26 años no disponía de título de transporte. Al intentar expulsarlo del convoy, el pasajero reaccionó con extrema violencia y golpeó repetidamente al empleado en la cabeza. El ataque se produjo poco después de que el tren saliera de la estación de Landstuhl, en el distrito de Kaiserslautern.

Como consecuencia de la agresión, el revisor quedó gravemente herido y tuvo que ser reanimado en el propio lugar de los hechos antes de ser trasladado de urgencia a un hospital en estado crítico.

La novela, concebida como una carta de amor onírica y surrealista a Barcelona, presenta una ciudad múltiple y superpuesta, construida a partir de capas temporales y voces literarias que abarcan distintas épocas y sensibilidades culturales.

Uclés explica que su acercamiento a Barcelona fue fruto de una estancia prolongada gracias a la beca Montserrat Roig, durante la cual se sumergió en la literatura catalana y en la historia cultural de la ciudad. De ese proceso surge un relato coral, con más de 80 artistas e intelectuales, que busca provocar al lector y transmitir una imagen caótica y rica de Barcelona, similar a un mosaico o un *trencadís*.

Sumar considera que las declaraciones de Irene Montero, en las que plantea ampliar el derecho al voto a los inmigrantes regularizados o incluso cambiar la ley para permitirlo, refuerzan el marco argumental de PP y Vox.

Se describen métodos clásicos para dividir en dos partes (por la diagonal o por el centro) y en cuatro (por las dos diagonales o cortes perpendiculares), destacando que todos generan piezas equivalentes. Para tres partes, un corte paralelo simple falla en igualar el borde, ya que los trozos centrales y laterales difieren en corteza.

Las declaraciones han generado una ola de críticas y preocupación en redes sociales y entre expertos en derechos civiles, que consideran que la presencia de agentes federales en los puntos de votación constituye una forma clara de intimidación del electorado. El Brennan Center for Justice recuerda que tanto la legislación federal como la de los estados prohíben expresamente el despliegue de fuerzas federales en colegios electorales y cualquier práctica destinada a amedrentar a los votantes.

Según el informe policial remitido a la Audiencia Nacional, Sánchez habría facilitado la entrada de 58,5 toneladas de cocaína ocultas en 37 contenedores marítimos procedentes de Latinoamérica, con un valor estimado superior a los 2.060 millones de euros. A cambio, habría recibido al menos 32 millones de euros.

La investigación se apoya de forma decisiva en el volcado del teléfono móvil de Ignacio Torán, considerado el cabecilla de la organización criminal, donde se hallaron anotaciones detalladas, pantallazos y mensajes que evidencian una relación prolongada con el inspector jefe, conocido entre los narcos como “El Amigo”. Sánchez proporcionaba información sensible sobre controles aduaneros y sistemas de inspección, alertando a la red criminal de qué contenedores iban a ser revisados y cuáles no.

Según el Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear, entre el 3,8% y el 7% de las muertes por esta enfermedad se atribuyen a la exposición al radón, con Galicia y Extremadura como las comunidades más afectadas. El gas, que emana de rocas ricas en uranio, puede acumularse en los edificios y su concentración varía considerablemente según la ubicación, la altura de la vivienda, el tipo de construcción y la densidad de población. Aunque los mapas oficiales permiten identificar zonas con niveles elevados, los expertos alertan de que la única forma fiable de conocer la concentración en un edificio es mediante mediciones directas y prolongadas, preferiblemente durante los meses fríos y realizadas por laboratorios acreditados.

Desde el entorno de Errejón insisten en que mantendrán la querella hasta el final con el objetivo de demostrar su inocencia y subrayan que su postura no ha cambiado desde el inicio del caso: confían en la justicia y consideran que los hechos deben aclararse exclusivamente en sede judicial.

A mediodía del 4 de febrero de 2026, el nivel del agua rozaba los 1,90 metros y el caudal superaba los 80 m³/s, cifras muy elevadas aunque aún lejos de las registradas en las graves inundaciones de febrero y marzo de 2025, cuando se superaron los 2 metros y los 400 m³/s.

La Delegación del Gobierno en Madrid, siguiendo el Protocolo de Comunicación de Crecidas, ha pedido extremar la precaución, evitar acercarse a los cauces fluviales y limitar los desplazamientos innecesarios. En San Fernando de Henares se están instalando barreras provisionales para proteger el polideportivo municipal ante un posible desbordamiento. El delegado del Gobierno, Francisco Martín, se ha desplazado al lugar para supervisar los trabajos.

Esta declaración se enmarca en su persistente narrativa de fraude masivo en los comicios de 2020, que aún niega pese a la ausencia de pruebas y a múltiples rechazos judiciales. Trump argumenta que es necesario centralizar el voto para evitar supuestas trampas demócratas, vinculándolo también a su política de deportaciones masivas de inmigrantes indocumentados, a los que acusa sin evidencia de votar ilegalmente en grandes cantidades.

La propuesta choca directamente con la Constitución estadounidense, que en el artículo I, sección 4, asigna a los estados la regulación de las elecciones, manteniendo un sistema descentralizado gestionado por funcionarios locales de ambos partidos.

Estas momias, conservadas gracias al clima árido, pertenecen a una población antigua que los científicos denominan 'fantasma', ya que su linaje genético no había sido identificado previamente de forma directa en restos físicos.

Dirigido por la arqueogenetista Nada Salem, del Instituto Max Planck de Antropología Evolutiva, el análisis muestra que esta rama se separó de los linajes subsaharianos hace unos 50.000 años, coincidiendo con la migración de humanos modernos fuera de África.

Según un estudio publicado en 2024 por la Escuela de Salud Pública de la Universidad de Harvard, seis grandes redes sociales ingresan alrededor de 11.000 millones de dólares anuales en Estados Unidos gracias a la publicidad dirigida específicamente a menores de edad. Este modelo de negocio explica, en parte, la resistencia del sector tecnológico a las nuevas restricciones anunciadas por el Gobierno español, como la prohibición del acceso a redes sociales a menores de 16 años.

El informe señala que el uso de redes sociales entre menores se ha duplicado en la última década y que casi la mitad de los menores de edad las utilizan de forma habitual, a pesar de que muchas plataformas prohíben el registro de menores en sus propias condiciones de uso.

La solución fue innovadora: eliminar las alas tradicionales y diseñar el fuselaje de manera que él mismo generara sustentación, dando origen a los llamados Cuerpos Sustentadores (Lifting Bodies). El primer prototipo, el M2-F1, estaba construido de madera y tubos de acero y fue remolcado por un Pontiac descapotable para sus primeras pruebas. Este diseño evolucionó hacia modelos metálicos como el M2-F2 y el HL-10, lanzados desde bombarderos B-52, que permitían aterrizajes planeados pero extremadamente difíciles. El accidente del piloto Bruce Peterson en 1967 dio lugar a la famosa introducción de la serie 'El Hombre de los Seis Millones de Dólares'. Con el X-24B, la NASA logró aterrizajes precisos y sentó las bases para el Transbordador Espacial. Hoy, conceptos derivados como el Dream Chaser ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-los-cuerpos-sustentadores-de-la-nasa-y-su-legado-en-la-aviacion-espacial</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-historia-de-los-cuerpos-sustentadores-de-la-nasa-y-su-legado-en-la-aviacion-espacial</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 15:20:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La concejala de Alguazas recupera 107 viviendas ocupadas en su municipio mediante desokupaciones legales]]></title><description><![CDATA[María Segura, abogada y segunda teniente de alcalde de Alguazas, Murcia, ha destacado por sus medidas efectivas contra la ocupación ilegal de viviendas. Desde su incorporación al gobierno local en junio de 2023 con Unidad X Alguazas, ha logrado recuperar 107 viviendas, reduciendo notablemente la okupación y la delincuencia en un municipio de unos 10.000 habitantes. La estrategia implementada incluye evaluaciones individualizadas de cada caso, coordinación con la Policía Local y desokupaciones “in fraganti”, procedimientos legales que permiten desalojos inmediatos cuando la ocupación acaba de producirse. En situaciones más complejas, como narcopisos o casos que involucran a personas vulnerables, intervienen los Servicios Sociales para garantizar apoyo y recursos adecuados.

Durante el reportaje, se recogen posturas diversas. Algunos ciudadanos relativizan el caso y sostienen que, de no tratarse de una persona vinculada a una figura política relevante, no tendría tanta exposición mediática. Otros, sin embargo, subrayan que el propio González Amador ha reconocido los hechos y la deuda con Hacienda, por lo que consideran que no existe una persecución política, sino la aplicación normal de la ley.

Ortega Smith sostiene que la votación de su expulsión se realizó en apenas dos minutos a través de un grupo de WhatsApp, lo que a su juicio demuestra que el CEN ha dejado de ser un órgano deliberativo para convertirse en una instancia meramente formal que ratifica decisiones tomadas de antemano por la cúpula del partido.

Esta situación coloca a España como uno de los cuatro países europeos donde los ingresos por pensión pública son suficientes para cubrir los costes básicos de la jubilación, junto con Polonia, República Checa y Rumanía. No obstante, esta suficiencia promedio no elimina las vulnerabilidades. Los colectivos más expuestos al riesgo de pobreza son las mujeres jubiladas, quienes no poseen vivienda en propiedad y los hogares con ingresos más bajos. La vivienda representa el 38% del gasto de los mayores, y aunque el 80% de los jubilados son propietarios, los que viven de alquiler enfrentan mayor presión económica.

El estudio revela un “eje regulador” celular que involucra al receptor PPARβ/δ, fundamental para que la metformina ejerza parte de sus efectos en la reducción de glucosa en sangre. Además, este mecanismo aumenta los niveles de la proteína GDF15, asociada con una mejor utilización de la energía y la regulación del metabolismo. Este hallazgo no cambia los tratamientos actuales, pero aporta información crucial para el desarrollo de terapias más personalizadas y eficaces, especialmente para pacientes que responden de manera variable a la metformina.

Además, el artículo destaca la actitud reciente de Tarantino: crítico de otros cineastas, provocador en redes y semirretirado, mientras sus colegas siguen innovando y defendiendo el cine en salas.

Se destaca que Benjamin Netanyahu, primer ministro de Israel, se opuso a hacer concesiones y que las ofertas presentadas por Clinton y Ehud Barak eran insuficientes y sesgadas a favor de Israel, según reconocimientos de negociadores israelíes y estadounidenses.

La decisión responde a la aplicación del principio de prejudicialidad penal, al coincidir los hechos investigados por Hacienda con los que forman parte de una causa penal en curso por presuntos delitos de corrupción en los negocios.

Carrasco, esposa de Fernando Camino, presidente de Quirón Prevención, está imputada en una pieza separada vinculada a la investigación sobre la pareja de la presidenta madrileña, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. El juez considera que la continuidad del procedimiento administrativo podría interferir con la instrucción penal, ya que las personas y operaciones examinadas por la Agencia Tributaria son sustancialmente las mismas que se investigan en sede judicial.

La actuación se inició gracias a la colaboración ciudadana, que alertó del posible abandono de varios animales encerrados en una vivienda aislada y sin ninguna persona a su cargo. A partir de ese aviso, agentes del Servicio de Protección de la Naturaleza (SEPRONA), junto con veterinarios de la Junta de Castilla y León, realizaron varias inspecciones para comprobar el estado de los canes.

Entre ellos aparecen varias figuras españolas, tanto del ámbito político como empresarial y social. La presencia de estos nombres en los archivos no implica la comisión de delitos ni su inclusión formal en la investigación judicial, extremo que el propio artículo subraya.

Uno de los nombres más destacados es el del rey emérito Juan Carlos I, mencionado en más de una decena de documentos, en su mayoría recortes de prensa y correos internos de Epstein. Entre ellos figura una referencia a una cena supuestamente prevista en Nueva York en septiembre de 2018, organizada por terceros.

Organizaciones agrarias como ASAJA temen que los productos procedentes de estos países no cumplan los mismos estándares sanitarios, medioambientales y de uso de fitosanitarios que se exigen a los productores europeos. Sin embargo, desde el Ministerio de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentación (MAPA) insisten en que la normativa es clara: cualquier alimento que entre en la UE debe cumplir exactamente los mismos requisitos que los producidos dentro del mercado comunitario, exista o no un acuerdo comercial.

Los controles en frontera se basan en un sistema de análisis de riesgos.

Ambas penas provienen del sumario 13/13, un caso controvertido por las intervenciones del CNI y las denuncias de torturas durante el proceso.

El auto, fechado el 28 de enero y difundido por Efe, concede diez días naturales desde la notificación para que ingresen voluntariamente en prisión; de no hacerlo, se emitirán órdenes de busca y captura.

La petición ha sido dirigida a la delegada del Gobierno en Navarra y se fundamenta en la responsabilidad institucional derivada de una mala praxis policial acreditada judicialmente.

La resolución del TEDH, que ya es definitiva después de que la Abogacía del Estado decidiera no recurrirla, concluye que durante la investigación se produjeron irregularidades muy graves.

Estas viviendas, levantadas sobre suelo público vendido por el Ayuntamiento a una cooperativa por 6,6 millones de euros, estaban destinadas a garantizar el acceso a la vivienda habitual y a evitar cualquier uso especulativo.

La normativa autonómica establece que los adjudicatarios de viviendas protegidas en régimen de compra deben empadronarse en ellas y destinarlas a residencia habitual, además de cumplir estrictos requisitos económicos. Sin embargo, según ha denunciado Compromís, algunos propietarios no residen en los inmuebles, otros viven en el extranjero y varios pisos han sido anunciados en portales inmobiliarios a precios muy superiores a los permitidos, lo que constituiría una clara irregularidad.

La iniciativa, impulsada por el gobierno laborista galés, responde a un creciente malestar social ante la desconfianza hacia la clase política, alimentada por promesas incumplidas y la manipulación informativa.

La nueva norma busca proteger a los votantes y reforzar la calidad democrática, situando la verdad y los hechos verificables en el centro del debate público. En un contexto marcado por la proliferación de noticias falsas y estrategias de desinformación, la ley envía un mensaje claro: el discurso político no está exento de responsabilidad legal.

No obstante, la aplicación práctica de esta medida plantea importantes desafíos.

Epstein, delincuente sexual convicto, fue hallado sin vida en agosto de 2019 en su celda del Centro Correccional Metropolitano de Nueva York, mientras esperaba juicio por múltiples cargos de tráfico sexual. El informe forense determinó que la causa de la muerte fue el suicidio por ahorcamiento, con la presencia de varias fracturas en huesos del cuello, incluido el hioides.

Según los médicos forenses, este tipo de fracturas puede darse tanto en casos de ahorcamiento como en estrangulamientos, aunque son más frecuentes en homicidios. No obstante, los especialistas subrayan que la rotura del hioides no es incompatible con un suicidio, especialmente en personas de edad avanzada como Epstein, que tenía 66 años. El informe también describe la presencia de hemorragias petequiales en los ojos y en las mucosas de los labios, un hallazgo habitual en m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-autopsia-de-jeffrey-epstein-detalla-fracturas-cervicales-compatibles-con-ahorcamiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-autopsia-de-jeffrey-epstein-detalla-fracturas-cervicales-compatibles-con-ahorcamiento</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 06:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Catorce jóvenes detenidos en Ontinyent por delitos de odio y agresiones tránsfobas continuadas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Policía Nacional ha detenido en la localidad valenciana de Ontinyent a 14 jóvenes de entre 15 y 20 años como presuntos responsables de una serie de delitos de odio, lesiones, amenazas y quebrantamiento de condena contra una persona de su entorno que había realizado un cambio de sexo. Según la investigación, los hechos se prolongaron desde junio de 2024 y se produjeron de forma reiterada en distintos ámbitos de la vida cotidiana de la víctima, incluyendo el centro educativo, espacios de ocio y celebraciones públicas.

Los investigadores han constatado que las agresiones eran tanto físicas como verbales y que se llevaban a cabo de manera grupal, con el objetivo de intensificar la intimidación y la humillación hacia la víctima. Las actuaciones incluían insultos, vejaciones, amenazas y ataques directos motivados por transfobia, lo que llevó a tipificar los hechos como delitos de odio.

Las pruebas clave son varios vídeos grabados por trabajadoras del centro, quienes decidieron permanecer en sus puestos durante más tiempo para documentar las agresiones en lugar de abandonar el empleo como habían hecho otros empleados anteriormente.

Prashad, quien sufrió abusos sexuales en su infancia, afirma que no puede tolerar ningún tipo de vínculo con alguien que explotó a niños, y considera indefendible la amistad de Chomsky con Epstein. Destaca que en febrero de 2019, meses antes de los nuevos cargos federales contra Epstein, Chomsky le aconsejó ignorar la cobertura mediática negativa y la 'histeria' sobre el abuso de mujeres.

Frente a esa visión equidistante, el autor sostiene que la guerra tuvo ganadores y perdedores muy claros: los republicanos, demócratas y defensores de la legalidad fueron derrotados, mientras que los fascistas no solo ganaron militarmente, sino que se enriquecieron materialmente gracias al conflicto y a la represión posterior.

Maestre apoya su argumento en una cita del propio Francisco Franco, pronunciada en 1940, en la que reconocía que los ricos que participaron en la guerra salieron aún más ricos al finalizarla, gracias a la apropiación y revalorización de bienes que antes estaban en riesgo. Este reconocimiento, según el autor, desmonta el relato de la derrota colectiva y explica por qué determinados sectores insisten en diluir las responsabilidades: aceptar que hubo vencedores implica admitir ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-guerra-civil-espanola-vencedores-economicos-victimas-morales-y-el-intento-de-borrar-responsabilidades</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 02:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El bitcoin cae un 40% tras su máximo de 2025 en un contexto de menor demanda y cambio de preferencias de inversión]]></title><description><![CDATA[El bitcoin atraviesa una fase de fuerte corrección tras haber marcado un máximo histórico en octubre de 2025. Desde entonces, su cotización ha caído alrededor de un 40%, pasando de más de 105.000 euros a situarse en torno a los 64.000 euros en apenas cuatro meses. A diferencia de caídas anteriores, los analistas subrayan que no existe un detonante único y claro que explique este desplome, lo que ha alimentado la preocupación en el mercado.

Según fuentes citadas por Bloomberg, el problema principal es una crisis de confianza. La demanda de bitcoin estaría disminuyendo, la liquidez sería más limitada y el activo se estaría comportando de forma cada vez más desconectada de los grandes mercados financieros. Tradicionalmente, las criptomonedas se han presentado como un refugio alternativo en periodos de inestabilidad, pero en esta ocasión no han reaccionado ni al estrés geopolítico ni a la debilidad del dólar, ni siquiera a las fuertes oscilaciones recientes del oro y la plata.

La medida, que afecta de lleno a plataformas como X, propiedad de Musk, fue duramente criticada por el magnate.

A través de su propia red social, Musk calificó a Sánchez con términos como “fascista”, “totalitario”, “tirano” o “traidor”, utilizando un lenguaje especialmente agresivo que no pasó desapercibido.

La persona que llamó afirmó haber escuchado, en un viaje en avión a Palm Beach tras el 11-S, una conversación entre Epstein y Donald Trump en la que el entonces expresidente (o figura pública en ese momento) relataba haber visitado un país (posiblemente Israel) donde un jeque le habría 'dado su hija virgen'. Epstein respondió positivamente a la anécdota, y ambos comentaron sobre las características de mujeres jóvenes. La denunciante, que menciona contactos con Ghislaine Maxwell, Sarah Ferguson y Leon Black, también describe haber visto indicios de actividades inapropiadas en la casa de Epstein y haberse marchado perturbada.

Durante su trabajo en Minneapolis, acompañó a activistas contrarios a esta agencia en labores de vigilancia ciudadana y fue testigo directo de una detención que tuvo consecuencias inmediatas para una menor de once años, cuya madre fue arrestada mientras ella quedaba sola y desprotegida.

Pastor relató cómo, tras la detención, la niña tuvo que refugiarse en casa de una vecina en plena nevada, portando una carpeta con documentos para explicar que su madre había sido arrestada. El equipo periodístico y los voluntarios intentaron activar mecanismos de ayuda para garantizar la seguridad de la menor, evidenciando la fragilidad en la que quedan muchas familias inmigrantes tras este tipo de actuaciones.

Según el Boletín Hidrológico del Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica, los embalses peninsulares se sitúan en el 67,3% de su capacidad, lo que supone un incremento de 8,1 puntos en apenas siete días. Esta cifra está más de 14 puntos por encima de la media de la última década y supera ampliamente los registros habituales para esta época del año.

Hasta 31 pantanos han alcanzado el 100% de su capacidad, lo que ha obligado a realizar desembalses controlados en varias cuencas para garantizar la seguridad de las infraestructuras. El mes de enero ha sido clave en esta recuperación: ha resultado el más lluvioso de los últimos 25 años en la España peninsular, con un 85% más de precipitaciones de lo normal según la Aemet.

El evento, que pretendía debatir sobre la Guerra Civil Española con un enfoque de reconciliación y equidistancia, generó polémica desde el principio por su título (inicialmente más provocador en borrador) y por la participación de figuras como José María Aznar e Iván Espinosa de los Monteros. Varios participantes de izquierdas, como el escritor David Uclés, Antonio Maíllo (IU) y otros, renunciaron al considerar el planteamiento sesgado o inadecuado. Pérez-Reverte y la fundación atribuyeron la suspensión al 'sectarismo' y 'cobardía' de la izquierda (moderada y radical), incluyendo críticas en redes de Podemos, y anunciaron el aplazamiento a octubre manteniendo el título.

Pena, residente en Estados Unidos desde 2009, se había posicionado públicamente a favor de las políticas migratorias más restrictivas del presidente Donald Trump, defendiendo redadas, deportaciones rápidas y la criminalización de migrantes. En sus contenidos, diferenciaba entre 'criminales' —a quienes según él iba dirigida la represión— y el resto, pidiendo calma a la comunidad brasileña ante las primeras oleadas de detenciones del nuevo mandato.

La detención se produjo por no presentarse a una vista judicial relacionada con su propio estatus migratorio, según confirmaron fuentes cercanas al Brazilian Times y The Guardian.

La reseña fue escrita por Paige Rolland, una adolescente que utilizó la plataforma literaria Wattpad para dar su opinión, sin emplear insultos ni lenguaje ofensivo. Pese a ello, Brittain se obsesionó con el comentario y decidió tomar represalias.

Tras investigar la vida de la joven a través de redes sociales, el autor viajó cerca de 600 kilómetros desde Bedford, en Inglaterra, hasta Glenrothes, en Escocia, donde Rolland trabajaba en un supermercado. Una vez allí, la atacó por la espalda con una botella de vino mientras ella se encontraba desempeñando su labor.

El resultado es un episodio de precipitaciones continuas y muy intensas que llega en el peor momento posible: con el suelo ya completamente saturado.

Los modelos meteorológicos prevén acumulados semanales de entre 100 y 150 mm en amplias zonas, con picos que pueden alcanzar los 300 mm en regiones como Galicia, Extremadura y Andalucía.

Una de estas alternativas es Zrce, en la isla croata de Pag, que se está consolidando como el nuevo epicentro europeo de la fiesta. La playa ofrece festivales internacionales y clubes abiertos las 24 horas, como Papaya, Aquarius, Noa, Kalypso y Euphoria, con DJ de renombre. La gran ventaja de Zrce frente a Ibiza es el coste: vuelos directos desde Reino Unido desde 21 libras, entradas a discotecas gratuitas antes de medianoche o por menos de 10 euros, y bebidas mucho más asequibles.

Los correos electrónicos mencionan a una empresaria emiratí, Aziza Al-Ahmadi, y a un individuo identificado como Abdullah Al-Maari, presuntamente residentes en Arabia Saudí.

Las palabras de Feijóo, formuladas en forma de pregunta sobre si el diputado vasco poseía información relativa a los asesinatos de la banda, fueron interpretadas por Matute como el uso del conocido “comodín de ETA” en el debate político.

Esta afirmación, que choca con la Constitución estadounidense —que reserva la gestión de las elecciones a los estados y autoridades locales—, se enmarca en su persistente narrativa sobre supuestos fraudes electorales, sin pruebas concluyentes, especialmente respecto a su derrota en 2020 frente a Joe Biden.

Las declaraciones llegan poco después de un allanamiento del FBI en una oficina electoral del condado de Fulton (Georgia), un foco habitual de las teorías de Trump.

El descenso es especialmente acusado entre las adolescentes de 15 y 16 años, donde en solo cuatro años el uso del condón se ha reducido casi 16 puntos.
