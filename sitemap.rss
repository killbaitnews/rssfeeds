Both vessels, allegedly part of Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' used to evade Western sanctions, caught fire, raising fears of an environmental disaster. A few days later, on December 2, another attack targeted the Russian ship Midvolga 2, which was transporting sunflower oil to Georgia, also close to Turkish waters. The Turkish Foreign Ministry publicly voiced concern over these incidents, warning they posed serious risks to maritime safety and the environment in its exclusive economic zone. 

Ukraine did not deny involvement; its intelligence services (SBU) and navy released footage of the operations, presenting them as part of an effort to curtail Russia’s ability to export crude oil and fund the war. Critics of these actions, however, argue they amount to acts of piracy and possible war ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/putin-warns-of-possible-blockade-of-ukraine-s-black-sea-coast-after-attacks-on-russian-linked-ships</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/putin-warns-of-possible-blockade-of-ukraine-s-black-sea-coast-after-attacks-on-russian-linked-ships</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 09:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Media Ownership, Capital Interests, and the Framing of Antifascism in Spain]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores how major investment funds and corporations shape Spain’s media landscape and influence the public discourse around antifascism. It begins by citing Joseph Oughourlian, CEO of Amber Capital—an Anglo-American investment fund that holds controlling stakes in Grupo PRISA and INDRA—as a symbol of how financial interests dominate supposedly ideological institutions. The text argues that mainstream Spanish media, regardless of whether they present themselves as left-leaning or right-leaning, are controlled by the same economic groups, effectively limiting true freedom of expression within media narratives that serve elite interests.

The article situates this media control within a broader geopolitical context, claiming that European outlets are manufacturing an anti-Russian narrative to prepare the population psychologically for conflict. Quoting Lenin’s idea that fascism is 'capitalism in decay,' it asserts that Spain’s economic decline is creating conditions for socia]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/media-ownership-capital-interests-and-the-framing-of-antifascism-in-spain</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/media-ownership-capital-interests-and-the-framing-of-antifascism-in-spain</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 08:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[EU launches RESourceEU plan to coordinate strategic raw material procurement and reduce China dependence]]></title><description><![CDATA[The European Commission has unveiled the RESourceEU plan, a new initiative designed to confront Europe’s shortage of strategic metals essential for industries such as defense, renewable energy, and electric vehicles. Inspired by the joint purchasing mechanism used during the COVID-19 pandemic, this new centralized body will coordinate procurement among EU member states, manage supply in real time, and build collective bargaining power in global markets. Nearly €3 billion has already been allocated through the European Investment Bank and InvestEU to develop local infrastructure, with projects including a lithium mine in the Czech Republic and mining operations in Greenland.

The Commission’s approach is a direct response to China’s recent export restrictions on gallium and germanium, which severely affected European production lines, especially in the automotive and electronics sectors.

A December 5 email obtained by USA TODAY revealed that approximately 250 workers who were dismissed in March have been called back as the agency struggles to manage its caseload. The directive acknowledged mounting complaints and emphasized the need to utilize all available resources. According to the department’s spokesperson for legal affairs, Julie Hartman, the employees will not be rehired permanently, but their temporary return will help fulfill the agency’s legal obligations while ongoing litigation over the layoffs continues. The Office for Civil Rights, once a key protector of students’ anti-discrimination rights, has been severely reduced under President Donald Trump’s administration.

Mathias, who once led the Navy’s nuclear policy division, revealed that catastrophic technical failures have rendered much of the UK's submarine fleet inactive, creating an unprecedented situation for national defense. He explained that delays in constructing and maintaining submarines, especially the Astute-class vessels, have reached record levels. Many of the fleet’s submarines have spent years docked and unserviceable, such as the HMS Ambush, which has been idle for more than 1,200 days, and others like the Artful, Audacious, Astute, and Anson, all undergoing protracted maintenance. The newly commissioned HMS Agamemnon reportedly took 13 years to complete—an exceptionally long timeframe by naval standards.

The merger would create a colossal media conglomerate, potentially controlling the streaming industry and making Netflix an even more dominant player. Despite concerns from regulators in both the US and Europe about monopolistic behavior, there are signs that Netflix’s expansion could proceed. The European Union has previously blocked mergers, such as Alstom-Siemens, but the transatlantic nature of the Netflix-Warner merger complicates matters. If approved, Netflix’s control over streaming content could significantly reduce diversity of options for consumers, as other major companies like Disney, Apple, and Amazon may be forced to follow suit. The article suggests that, while Netflix is prepared to make concessions to competition, the resulting monopoly would have long-term implications for the market. There is a growing concern that this could lead to]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/netflix-s-potential-monopoly-and-its-impact-on-global-media</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/netflix-s-potential-monopoly-and-its-impact-on-global-media</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 19:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA’s Abandoned Reusable Nuclear Shuttle: The Ambitious 1970s Project That Never Flew]]></title><description><![CDATA[During the late 1960s, NASA envisioned that its Apollo program would evolve into an ambitious human mission to Mars by the 1980s. This vision, known as the Integrated Program Plan (IPP), relied heavily on nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP)—a technology that uses a fission reactor to heat liquid hydrogen and produce thrust with both high power and high efficiency. The United States tested several nuclear rocket engines during the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application) prototype. Building on this work, NASA devised the concept of a Reusable Nuclear Shuttle (RNS), a spacecraft stage powered by a NERVA engine intended to ferry payloads or crewed modules from low Earth orbit to higher or lunar orbits. Each shuttle could carry about 50 tons of cargo, refuel with up to 140 tons of liquid hydrogen, and operate indefinitely in space. Safety concerns led to extensive shielding designs and innovative hydrogen barriers to reduce radiation exposure. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nasa-s-abandoned-reusable-nuclear-shuttle-the-ambitious-1970s-project-that-never-flew</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nasa-s-abandoned-reusable-nuclear-shuttle-the-ambitious-1970s-project-that-never-flew</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 19:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leaked files reveal British military media censorship system]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article reports that the British military has established the Defence and Security Media Advisory Committee (DSMA), a body responsible for issuing D-Notices — advisory censorship directives to journalists and media outlets regarding national security topics. It alleges that the DSMA has been used to systematically suppress or alter information about sensitive events, such as the death of GCHQ codebreaker Gareth Williams, operations of the MI6 and British special forces, and the death of Princess Diana. While officially voluntary, the article claims most UK journalists comply with the committee’s requests, turning the system into an instrument of state control over media narratives. Documents obtained through Australian freedom of information laws allegedly reveal that British officials advised Australia on how to create a similar D-Notice system and that the DSMA operates within the Ministry of Defence while claiming independence from the government.

This marked a milestone: for the first time in nearly three decades of ISS operations, eight visiting spacecraft were simultaneously docked. These included crewed vehicles Soyuz MS-27, Soyuz MS-28, Crew Dragon Endeavour Crew-11, and cargo ships Progress MS-31, Progress MS-32, Cygnus NG-23, Dragon v2 CRS-33, and HTV-X1. The article by Daniel Marín examines how the ISS accommodates these vehicles using three different and often incompatible docking systems: the Russian SSVP, the U.S. CBM, and the NASA Docking System (NDS). The SSVP, used by Soyuz and Progress, relies on a probe-and-cone design dating back to the early 1970s, providing reliable mechanical links and fuel or power transfer capabilities. The CBM, developed during the Space Station Freedom era, offers a large hatch for uncrewed cargo vessels but require]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-how-the-iss-manages-eight-docked-spacecraft-with-three-docking-systems</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/understanding-how-the-iss-manages-eight-docked-spacecraft-with-three-docking-systems</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 18:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reflections on Empire and Power: When Domination Is Called Peace]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article titled 'Pacem apellant' on the Spanish blog 'La mirada del mendigo' is a brief reflection on the hypocrisy of imperialism and the language used to justify domination and violence. It opens with a famous quote by the Roman historian Tacitus: 'Auferre, trucidare, rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant,' which translates as 'To plunder, to slaughter, to steal, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.' The post uses this classical phrase to comment on contemporary global politics, likely referring to modern military or geopolitical actions that are described as promoting peace, democracy, or security but result in destruction and chaos instead.

In the comment section, the author reiterates this sentiment, translating the Latin into Spanish and interpreting it as a critique of imperial power: robbery, murder, and looting are falsely described as governance, and the resulting devastation is mislabeled as peace.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflections-on-empire-and-power-when-domination-is-called-peace</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/reflections-on-empire-and-power-when-domination-is-called-peace</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historical FPS 'Fourteen Years of Flames' Depicts China's Resistance During the Second Sino-Japanese War]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Steam store page for 'Fourteen Years of Flames' (烽火十四) introduces a forthcoming story-driven first-person shooter that explores China's struggle during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1931–1945).

This development represents the sixth Zapotec variant incorporated into Motorola’s mobile ecosystem and seeks to expand technological access for Indigenous communities historically excluded from digital priorities. The initiative acknowledges that language is the foundation of infrastructure: without the ability to write and communicate in one’s own language, any effort toward digital transformation or connectivity remains incomplete.

Writing as an expatriate addressing Americans, Mann examines how Germany’s historical development produced both profound artistic and intellectual achievements and catastrophic political consequences. He describes German character as caught between cosmopolitanism and provincialism, humility and arrogance, intellect and mysticism. Mann traces this duality to figures like Martin Luther, whom he sees as both a liberator and a reactionary, embodying the tension between spiritual freedom and political obedience. He laments that Luther’s rejection of political liberty left a legacy of submission to authority that ultimately paved the way for later disasters, such as Nazism. Through metaphors of demonism, Faustian bargains, and musical sensibility, he interprets German inwardness—its deep subjectivity and moral intensity—as both a ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/thomas-mann-s-reflection-on-the-german-soul-and-historical-responsibility</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/thomas-mann-s-reflection-on-the-german-soul-and-historical-responsibility</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 21:36:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Turkey Warns Ukraine Over Attacks on Russian Tankers in the Black Sea]]></title><description><![CDATA[Turkey has raised concerns over Ukraine’s attacks on Russian tankers in the Black Sea, which fall within Turkey’s exclusive economic zone. NATO, of which Turkey is a member, has been implicated in the attacks, with Ukraine claiming responsibility for two recent incidents. Turkish President Erdogan expressed his disapproval, stating that these attacks could jeopardize maritime safety, life, and the environment in the region. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan echoed this sentiment, calling the attacks 'very alarming' and summoning both the Ukrainian ambassador and the Russian charge d’affaires for discussions. The Black Sea is a crucial route for Turkey’s trade with Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and Bulgaria, and it is vital for grain transport. Additionally, the Black Sea is an important energy corridor for Turkey, which relies heavily on Russian gas transported through pipelines like Blue Stream and TurkStream.

The court rejected Ukraine's objections regarding the inadmissibility of Russia's claims, thus allowing them to be considered. This decision follows Ukraine's failed attempts to hold Russia accountable for the war's initiation. In 2022, Ukraine had filed a case against Russia accusing it of violating the Genocide Convention. However, the ICJ dismissed these claims in February 2023, leaving only the question of whether Ukraine itself had committed genocide. In November 2024, Russia submitted over 10,000 pages of evidence alleging that Ukraine had committed genocide against ethnic Russians and Russian speakers in the Donbas region. The evidence includes testimonies, expert reports, and documentation of over 140 instances of deliberate civilian destruction.

Drawing on data from a Croatian EV repair group, the author compares the cost of major components such as batteries, motors, and charging modules across various brands. The findings show that low-end models like the Dacia Spring or Kia Soul often have parts that cost far more than those of high-end vehicles like the Tesla Model S or Mercedes EQS. The author argues that this has nothing to do with production costs or quality, but rather with monopolistic pricing strategies from manufacturers who limit access to parts and repair codes.

This policy creates a situation where vehicle owners are forced to rely on dealerships for even basic repairs, making independent mechanics — and by extension, consumer choice — nearly obsolete. As a result, many otherwise functional vehicles are scrapped when repair costs exceed ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-electric-vehicle-design-and-repair-restrictions-create-waste-and-monopolies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/how-electric-vehicle-design-and-repair-restrictions-create-waste-and-monopolies</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roman-era Human-shaped Stele Discovered in Mugla to Be Exhibited at Fethiye Museum]]></title><description><![CDATA[Archaeologists in Türkiye have transported and secured a human-shaped grave stele discovered by a goat herder in the mountainous Seydikemer district of Mugla.

Recent US Census Bureau data, analyzed by The Economist, shows that only 11 percent of Americans at large companies reported using AI to produce goods and services in October 2025, down from 12 percent just two weeks prior. The trend is not limited to large companies; mid-sized businesses with 100-249 employees reported a rise in non-use from 74.1 percent in March to 81.4 percent in the latest survey. Similarly, large corporations with over 250 employees saw non-use grow to 68.6 percent from February’s low of 62.4 percent. Analysts point to AI remaining largely experimental rather than a driver of productivity, with some surveys indicating a decrease in usage from 46 percent in June to 37 percent by September.

Bankole describes joining the South London public school in 1980 at the age of nine, where Farage, then seventeen, allegedly mocked and harassed him because of his race. According to Bankole, Farage asked him where he was from and, upon hearing his answer, pointed away and said, 'That’s the way back to Africa.' The abuse reportedly continued, with Farage targeting him repeatedly at the school gates. 

Bankole explains that his family, of Nigerian heritage, came to Britain in the 1950s to work in healthcare, part of the Windrush generation who sought to contribute to the postwar rebuilding of the UK. Motivated to remain silent for decades, he finally decided to speak out after seeing Farage dismiss allegations of past racism as exaggerated or forgotten events. Bankole challenges this view, arguing that victims do not forget such experiences.

It traces how the valley’s complex borders and enclaves arose from the Soviet Union’s arbitrary territorial divisions, often drawn to serve Moscow’s control rather than local coherence. Following the Russian conquest of Central Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Soviets reorganized the region in the 1920s through a process called *razmezhevanie* (territorial delimitation). Efforts to assign each ethnic group its own republic quickly faltered due to mixed populations and poor linguistic understanding by Russian officials. Over time, constant border modifications created several enclaves—most notably Sokh (Uzbek but mainly Tajik-populated) and Vorukh (Tajik inside Kyrgyzstan)—which became flashpoints for disputes.

It began in May 1995 when Brendan Eich, an engineer at Netscape, developed a prototype of a lightweight scripting language in just ten days. Netscape and Sun Microsystems later announced it officially as JavaScript in December 1995. Initially conceived to make webpages more interactive and accessible to designers, JavaScript quickly became a fundamental component of web development. Drawing from influences like Scheme and Self, Eich created a flexible, prototype-based language distinct from Java despite the similar name. The language underwent multiple name changes—Mocha, LiveScript, and finally JavaScript—as Netscape sought to capitalize on the growing popularity of Java. Over the decades, JavaScript has evolved from a browser-based tool into a universal programming language used for server-side programming (Node.js), mobile apps (React Native), desk]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-origins-and-legacy-of-javascript-from-a-10-day-hack-to-the-web-s-core-language</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-origins-and-legacy-of-javascript-from-a-10-day-hack-to-the-web-s-core-language</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 00:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Capture of Pokrovsk and Its Implications for NATO's Potential Involvement in the Ukraine War]]></title><description><![CDATA[On December 5, 2025, the Russian forces successfully captured Pokrovsk, a city that had previously been renamed by Ukraine to erase its Soviet past. The city's fall marks a significant shift in the Ukraine conflict, as Pokrovsk was one of the largest urban centers still under Ukrainian control in the Donetsk region. Its strategic position as a defensive stronghold against Russia and as a key transportation hub made it crucial for Ukrainian and NATO forces. Following the 2014 coup in Ukraine, the city became a symbol of Donetsk’s independence, with a referendum affirming its break from Ukrainian rule. Despite the importance of the city, the capture was relatively swift, as Russian forces cut off supply lines to Ukrainian defenders, preventing prolonged urban combat. The fall of Pokrovsk opens the way for further Russian advancements into the vast plains beyond the Donbas, with fewer obstacles in their path.

The author explains that while Republicans in past decades occasionally proposed or supported incremental steps toward ensuring health care for all—such as President Nixon’s insurance plans, the creation of programs for children in the 1990s, or Trump’s initial promise to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with 'insurance for everyone'—the current GOP stance represents a sharp reversal. The centerpiece of this shift is the 'One Big Ugly' bill signed by the president in July 2025, projected to remove 17 million people from health insurance by 2034 due to cuts to Medicaid and new bureaucratic obstacles. Despite previous progress under the Biden administration, which reduced the uninsured rate to 8%, the article warns that rates are expected to climb again, especially in Republican-led states that contin]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/republican-policies-reverse-progress-toward-universal-health-coverage-in-the-u-s</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/republican-policies-reverse-progress-toward-universal-health-coverage-in-the-u-s</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 19:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO compares U.S. and China’s pace in AI infrastructure development]]></title><description><![CDATA[Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that China has a major advantage over the United States in constructing and powering AI infrastructure. Speaking in late November at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Huang highlighted how long it takes to build an AI data center in the U.S.—about three years from start to completion—versus the rapid pace in China, a country capable of erecting massive infrastructure projects such as hospitals in just a weekend. He identified two main challenges for the U.S.: slow construction cycles and limited energy capacity. According to Huang, China possesses roughly twice the energy generation of the U.S. despite having a smaller economy, and its capacity continues to grow, while the American energy supply remains relatively stagnant. 

Although he noted that Nvidia remains generations ahead of China in AI chip design and production, Huang cautioned that underestimating China’s manufacturing strength would be a mistake.

Facing opposition from Belgium, who rejects the idea of seizing Russian funds, von der Leyen has proposed using 'emergency measures' which only require a majority vote, ignoring the need for unanimous consent. This proposal would allow the EU to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's reconstruction, with the funds being presented as a 'loan,' despite Ukraine not being required to repay. The move also aims to strengthen Ukraine's defense industries by integrating them into the EU’s defense base, further blurring the lines between EU and Ukrainian military resources. The plan, which von der Leyen first introduced in September, will be discussed in the upcoming EU summit in December. Critics argue that this is a costly and controversial step, using Russia’s assets as a tool to prolong the war and benefit defense companies.

The document announces the end of the Wolfowitz Doctrine, which guided American foreign policy since the 1990s by seeking to preserve U.S. global dominance after the fall of the USSR. Instead, Washington now acknowledges a diminished role as a global 'policeman' and aims to consolidate itself as a strong hemispheric power. The new strategy narrows U.S. interests to the Western Hemisphere, prioritizing economic competition over military hostility toward China. It redefines China not as an existential threat but as an economic competitor on an equal footing. In the military sphere, the U.S. will focus on deterrence, maintaining the status quo in Taiwan, and mobilizing its allies—Japan, South Korea, and Europe—for economic competition rather than direct confrontation.

The termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haiti is particularly impactful, as more than 500,000 Haitian immigrants in the U.S. face deportation after the policy expires in February 2026. Additionally, the Trump administration's review of Green Card holders from 19 countries, mostly non-white majority nations, signals a continued stance against immigrants of color.

In Europe, EvoTears has been available since 2015 for around $20, while its U.S. version, Miebo—produced by Bausch & Lomb—costs over $800 per month. The piece argues that this discrepancy stems not from regulatory necessity, but from deliberate corporate manipulation of American drug approval laws. After obtaining exclusive rights to the drug in 2019, Bausch & Lomb chose to seek FDA approval as a prescription drug rather than pursue over-the-counter status. This decision allowed the company to patent the product, limit competition, and set exorbitant prices. Miebo’s sales exceeded $170 million in its first full year, far surpassing projections.

Telefónica’s plan to cut nearly 6,000 jobs in Spain—representing about a quarter of its workforce—forms part of a wider strategy to achieve efficiency, reduce debt, and redirect resources toward AI and cybersecurity. The move, however, signals a deeper shift: the company is replacing human control with data-driven management ('dataism'), maximizing profits through algorithmic oversight of labor and consumer behavior.

Western military planners have long assumed that dominance in GPS, satellite navigation, and digital mapping ensures operational control. However, Venezuela has focused on exploiting asymmetry rather than competing in technological parity.

According to the report, Von der Leyen is allegedly using several tactics: declaring a financial emergency specific to Ukraine, framing support for Ukraine as existential for the EU, extending sanctions against Russia permanently, mandating financial institutions like Euroclear to release Russian assets, and approving key legal measures through qualified majority voting to bypass potential vetoes from member states such as Belgium. The article questions the legality of invoking Article 122 of the EU Treaty, which is designed to provide financial aid to EU member states in exceptional circumstances, highlighting that Ukraine is not a member.

This breakthrough builds on years of work since the Higgs boson was first confirmed in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The new study, published in *Physical Review Letters*, combines data from the last two ATLAS runs, achieving a significance level of 3.4 standard deviations—an improvement over the 3.0 level previously reached by the CMS experiment. 

This finding is crucial because it probes how the Higgs field gives mass to particles. In the Standard Model of particle physics, the Higgs boson’s interactions with particles, known as Yukawa couplings, determine their mass. While earlier studies confirmed these interactions for heavier third-generation particles such as top and bottom quarks and tau leptons, the new result strengthens evidence for the coupling to second-generation fermions like m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/atlas-collaboration-finds-strong-evidence-of-higgs-boson-decaying-into-muon-antimuon-pair</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/atlas-collaboration-finds-strong-evidence-of-higgs-boson-decaying-into-muon-antimuon-pair</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 16:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gender-Based Violence Rises in Argentina Amid Milei’s Rollback of Women’s Rights]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores the worsening crisis of gender-based violence in Argentina under President Javier Milei. It opens with the murder of Fernanda Soledad Yramain, a young mother from Tucumán who repeatedly sought police protection from her violent partner before being killed in 2024. Her case exemplifies what many activists see as a systemic collapse of safeguards for women. Since taking office in December 2023, Milei’s administration has dismantled institutions and programs aimed at preventing and addressing violence against women, such as the Ministry of Women and the Acompañar program. Funding cuts have led to reduced staff on emergency hotlines and fewer prosecutorial offices dedicated to gender violence cases. Data from the province of Tucumán show a sharp decline in protection orders and an increase in femicides. Nationally, 295 femicides were recorded in 2024, with a surge in early 2025. Critics, including feminist lawyers and Amnesty International, warn that Milei’s government]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gender-based-violence-rises-in-argentina-amid-milei-s-rollback-of-women-s-rights</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/gender-based-violence-rises-in-argentina-amid-milei-s-rollback-of-women-s-rights</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 13:34:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How AI and Robotics Are Transforming Scientific Research and Mexico’s Role in It]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article explores how artificial intelligence and robotics are rapidly reshaping global scientific research, particularly through their integration into laboratory environments.

Led by Enric Vilajosana, Miquel Àngel Fullana, and Joaquim Raduà, the study analyzed data from 42 previous experiments involving over 2,199 participants worldwide. They found that earlier inconsistencies in identifying brain areas involved in fear learning were due to limited statistical power rather than actual biological differences. By combining all available data, the team revealed that fear learning activates several interconnected brain regions, including the insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, premotor areas, anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, caudate, and parts of the midbrain. Simultaneously, areas linked to the brain’s default mode network showed decreased activity, reflecting a shift of attention toward potential threats.

Telefónica presents its workforce reduction as part of a strategic efficiency plan to cut debt and reallocate €3 billion by 2030 toward emerging sectors like AI and cybersecurity. However, the piece argues that this shift exposes deeper systemic issues: AI, while capable of producing abundance by automating work and optimizing resources, is deployed instead to preserve profitability and the capitalist order. Rather than being used to reduce working hours or redistribute productivity gains, technological advances are driving unemployment and social inequality.

He highlighted Washington’s continued purchase of uranium from Russia, which fuels American nuclear power plants, while at the same time urging New Delhi to reduce its imports of Russian oil. Putin pointed out the inconsistency in the US position, stating that if America has the right to buy fuel from Russia, India should enjoy the same privilege. Russia currently supplies about a quarter of the uranium used in US reactors, with estimated sales of $1.2 billion in 2025, up from $800 million in 2024.

The controversy grew with an opinion piece by Joren Vermeersch, an advisor to the Belgian Defense Minister, who insulted France and argued that rejecting American weapons would marginalize Europe strategically. Recently, the first F-35 arrived in Belgium, but it faced technical problems, and the country's limited airspace caused further complications. Belgium's airspace is among the most restricted in Europe, making it difficult to conduct the necessary training for such advanced jets.

Initially, it seemed successful, but the policy quickly backfired. Hunters often cut off tails and released the rats to breed more, while some even raised rats deliberately for profit. This perverse incentive caused the rat population to increase, exposing hunters to greater plague risk and undermining public health efforts. The broader context involved unequal urban planning: European quarters received modern sewers, while Vietnamese neighborhoods were left with open gutters, exacerbating rat infestations. Experts highlight this as an early example of Goodhart’s Law, showing how poorly designed incentives can lead to unintended consequences.

The release follows ongoing investigations into Epstein's crimes, including a 2022 settlement in which the US Virgin Islands attorney general secured over $100 million from Epstein’s estate after alleging sexual abuse and trafficking at Little St James, one of his two islands. Congressional leaders emphasized that while the images do not reveal new evidence, their release is part of a broader effort to maintain public transparency and pressure on the Justice Department to release additional files by the December 19 deadline.

The agreement allows Hidalgo to adopt a range of advanced digital platforms and systems developed by the Digital Agency for Public Innovation (ADIP) in Mexico City. These include digital authentication, unique digital records, remote procedures, digital citizen services, open data systems, and automated chatbots. By implementing these tools, Hidalgo aims to streamline administrative processes, reduce bureaucracy, enhance transparency, and improve citizen access to public services. For Mexico City, the collaboration reinforces its status as a national leader in digital government services. Hidalgo benefits by avoiding the cost and time required to develop its own systems, enabling more efficient allocation of resources.

Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), have joined forces to advance legislation banning members of Congress from trading stocks. Using a discharge petition—a procedural tactic previously employed to release the Jeffrey Epstein files—the coalition seeks to bypass House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has limited floor votes on certain issues. Once a discharge petition gains enough signatures and seven legislative days pass, a vote is automatically scheduled. The push reflects growing public concern over lawmakers using insider knowledge for personal financial gain, an issue highlighted during previous administrations but delayed under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) described the coalition as surprising given its ideological diversity. Earlier attempts by Luna to use a discharge petition for proxy voting rights were blocked by Johnson.

Gardner photographed the toad and the image was published in The Hamilton Spectator, quickly gaining attention in both Canada and the United States. The toad's unusual appearance baffled scientists, but it has been confirmed as a real phenomenon known as a macromutation. This type of mutation can significantly alter an organism's structure, and in amphibians, it sometimes affects limbs or other body parts. In this case, the mutation caused the toad's eye sockets to be absent, resulting in the eyes growing from its palate. While the exact cause of such mutations remains unclear, scientists suspect a parasitic trematode infection may play a role. Despite its strange appearance, the toad can live a normal life, as its eyes remain functional. Interestingly, even normally developed frogs and toads can retract their eye]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canadian-photographer-captures-rare-toad-mutation-with-eyes-in-its-mouth</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/canadian-photographer-captures-rare-toad-mutation-with-eyes-in-its-mouth</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:57:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Geopolitical Maneuvers and the Uncertain Path to Peace in Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article by Rafael Poch de Feliu examines the complex and contradictory dynamics surrounding current peace discussions about the war in Ukraine. It highlights statements by Vladimir Putin asserting that Russia is not seeking war with Europe but is prepared for it if necessary, contrasting this readiness with what he describes as Europe’s 'illusion' of defeating Russia. The piece details NATO’s increasing aggressiveness, citing potential preemptive strikes on Moscow and ongoing maritime drone attacks against Russian cargo ships allegedly orchestrated by British military personnel in Ukraine.

Poch explains that contacts between Putin and U.S. envoys—specifically Donald Trump’s associates Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner—reflect internal divisions within the American establishment about how to handle Russia. The article argues that Trump's negotiations with Moscow are pragmatic rather than pacifist, seeking to save resources, shift focus to Asia, and maintain pressure on Russia and Chi]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/geopolitical-maneuvers-and-the-uncertain-path-to-peace-in-ukraine</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/geopolitical-maneuvers-and-the-uncertain-path-to-peace-in-ukraine</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ukraine Conflict Approaches a Formal End, But Tensions and Hybrid Warfare May Persist]]></title><description><![CDATA[The news article reports that recent Russian advances in Ukraine, including the capture of Pokrovsk and Volchansk, indicate a gradual decline in Ukrainian operational capabilities. Although the territory gained in recent weeks is modest relative to Ukraine’s total size, these advances are more resilient due to the prevalence of drones, which limit rapid tank movements but strengthen occupied positions. Ukrainian commanders have signaled that they may resist political agreements involving territorial withdrawal, but the article notes that actual military defiance is unlikely without central supply interruptions. The author argues that the formal conclusion of the conflict could arrive by spring or summer, yet warns that this will not be a true end. The piece highlights a potential long-term alliance between radicalized Ukrainian forces and European militaristic agendas, which may result in permanent hybrid warfare, including sabotage, cyberattacks, and covert operations.

The testimony alleges a systemic 'kill policy' by the UK Special Forces unit UKSF1 and describes cover-ups by senior commanders and a failure to properly investigate these war crimes. The inquiry revealed incidents where the number of enemy killed far exceeded weapons recovered, casting doubt on official reports. A particularly disturbing case cited was the shooting of two young children and their parents during a nighttime raid in Nimruz province in 2012. The officer described a culture within UKSF1 of casual killings and data manipulation to conceal unlawful acts.

Originally purchased in 2002 by a Qatari prince for $9.6 million, it sold at Christie’s London for £22.9 million ($30.2 million), surpassing expectations. Out of the 50 Fabergé Imperial Eggs commissioned for Russian Tsarinas, only 44 survive today, with just six held privately. Designed by Alma Pihl, granddaughter of Fabergé’s workmaster, the Winter Egg is adorned with more than 3,200 rose-cut diamonds and intricately carved rock crystal, platinum, nephrite, and gold details. Its hidden surprise—a platinum and diamond trellis basket containing quartz wood anemones and garnets—is emblematic of Fabergé’s signature craftsmanship. The egg’s design was inspired by the snowflakes seen through Pihl’s workshop window and is part of the Winter Jewels series, initially created for Swedish-Russian tycoon Emanuel Nobel.

In contrast, by 2020, global child mortality had dropped to just 4.3%, with countries like Japan and Norway achieving rates as low as 0.3%. This extraordinary reduction is attributed to advancements in nutrition, clean water, sanitation, neonatal healthcare, vaccinations, medicines, and significant decreases in poverty, conflicts, and famine. Personal anecdotes shared by readers illustrate how infant and child mortality was a common experience only a century ago, with multiple generations experiencing the loss of siblings or children. Modern medicine and public health improvements have fundamentally transformed human lifespan, largely by preventing early deaths rather than prolonging life at older ages. Experts argue that investing in public health measures could further enhance global health outcomes.

Unlike previous images that exaggerated reds and browns, this mosaic presents Mars as it might appear to the human eye, showcasing muted grays, yellows, oranges, and pale blues that highlight the planet's mineral diversity. The map, with a resolution of approximately 2 kilometers per pixel, was created from tens of thousands of observations collected between 2004 and 2022. The HRSC's unique multispectral and stereo imaging capabilities allowed scientists to correct for dust levels, variable sunlight, and atmospheric haze to produce a seamless global map.

Employees are instructed to complete the survey using work devices and the VPN, and participation is claimed to be protected from retaliation. This survey is part of a broader federal initiative, following similar surveys at the State Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs, responding to an executive order establishing a task force on religious bias.

El muñeco, un cocodrilo de peluche llamado Coqui, desapareció la mañana del sábado mientras preparaban un viaje a Burgos para visitar a los abuelos. Según contó el padre, Mario, el peluche iba en la mochila del niño, que estaba abierta porque ‘no quería que se ahogara’. El extravío se produjo en un tramo muy corto entre la avenida de Zaragoza y la calle Agoncillo, donde creen que alguien podría haberlo recogido accidentalmente. La familia revisó la casa, el ascensor y los contenedores, e incluso la terraza, sin resultados. Aunque el muñeco no tiene valor económico, sí posee un gran valor sentimental: fue un regalo de los Reyes Magos para el hermano mayor hace siete años, y desde entonces Gonzalo duerme cada noche con él.

Durante meses, Chapman planeó el crimen, influido por elementos culturales como la película La semilla del diablo, el libro El guardián entre el centeno y la pintura Lincoln in Dalivision de Salvador Dalí, que intensificaron su obsesión y desequilibrio. El asesinato se consumó cuando Lennon regresaba de un estudio de grabación y Chapman le disparó cinco veces, alcanzándole cuatro.

Entre estas técnicas destaca el uso de una estructura conocida como 'caja de confinamiento', un espacio extremadamente reducido donde los detenidos son obligados a permanecer durante horas, con las manos y pies sujetos, sin poder sentarse o recostarse y expuestos a condiciones extremas de calor, sol e insectos. Las dimensiones de esta caja son comparables a las utilizadas por la CIA en Tailandia para torturar a Abu Zubaydah, quien pasó más de 11 días en un espacio similar. Los detenidos en Alligator Alcatraz han sido castigados simplemente por pedir atención médica para otros internos o por alertar a los guardias sobre necesidades básicas, evidenciando un uso punitivo y no investigativo de estas medidas.

Ambas defienden teorías sin fundamento que vinculan las riadas con la llamada 'geoingeniería marroquí' y supuestos 'ritos satánicos'. La jueza había considerado que su actuación representaba un abuso de derecho, ya que intentaron personarse en una pieza separada relacionada con el abogado de un investigado, José María Bueno Manzanares, lo que fue interpretado como una maniobra procesal improcedente. Sin embargo, el tribunal estima ahora el recurso de las expulsadas al entender que una actuación incorrecta no implica necesariamente su exclusión del proceso, sino solo el rechazo de la pretensión inadecuada.

Rajoy’ en los denominados papeles de Bárcenas, una contabilidad paralela del Partido Popular (PP) investigada dentro del caso Gürtel. Los documentos, elaborados por el extesorero del PP Luis Bárcenas, registraban supuestos pagos no declarados a diversos dirigentes del partido entre 1990 y 2008. Entre los nombres mencionados aparecían las iniciales ‘M. Rajoy’, que muchos relacionaron con el expresidente Mariano Rajoy.

Según las investigaciones, estos apuntes reflejaban pagos periódicos en pesetas y posteriormente en euros, aunque Rajoy negó haber recibido dinero en negro o haber tenido conocimiento de una caja B. La Audiencia Nacional reconoció la existencia de esa contabilidad paralela en sentencias firmes, pero durante el juicio específico sobre la caja B detectó discrepancias entre las copias publicadas por la prensa y los originales aportados por Bárcenas.

Los combates, que comenzaron el domingo por la noche, han causado al menos diez muertos y casi 150.000 desplazados, agravando una crisis humanitaria en la región fronteriza. El origen del conflicto se remonta a disputas coloniales por la soberanía de templos antiguos situados en territorio limítrofe. Ambos gobiernos se acusan mutuamente de romper la tregua: el Ministerio de Defensa camboyano denunció ataques tailandeses en Banteay Meanchey, mientras que Bangkok informó de la muerte de tres soldados de su ejército. Las tensiones se agravan con declaraciones nacionalistas: el ex primer ministro camboyano Hun Sen justificó las represalias de su país tras ‘paciencia prolongada’, mientras el jefe del gobierno tailandés, Anutin Charnvirakul, defendió la necesidad de proteger la soberanía nacional.

De ellos, casi la mitad perdieron la vida en la Franja de Gaza, lo que convierte a este territorio en el lugar más mortífero para la prensa internacional en 2025. La organización advierte de una alarmante regresión en la protección de los profesionales de la información en contextos de guerra, subrayando que el conflicto de Gaza ha sido el escenario más sangriento para el periodismo desde que RSF comenzó a documentar estos datos. 

El informe resalta que muchos de los periodistas fallecidos en Gaza eran reporteros locales que trabajaban en condiciones extremas, sin apenas protección, para documentar los efectos de los bombardeos y las operaciones militares.

El desembolso incluye tanto costes internos y externos como los derechos de emisión. Solo la retransmisión de seis festejos desde la plaza de toros de la Maestranza de Sevilla —tres de la Feria de Abril y tres de la Feria de San Miguel— ha implicado un gasto de 744.620 euros.

El trasplante se realizó en diciembre de 2024, y cinco semanas después el receptor comenzó a mostrar síntomas como temblores, debilidad en las extremidades inferiores, confusión e incontinencia urinaria. Fue hospitalizado y ventilado, pero no sobrevivió. Las pruebas post mortem confirmaron la rabia. La investigación reveló que el donante, residente en Idaho, había sido arañado en la espinilla por un zorrillo mientras defendía a un gatito; aunque no consideró que el arañazo fuera significativo, la rabia ya se había transmitido. Se detectó una cepa de rabia consistente con la rabia de murciélago plateado en los riñones del donante, confirmando la transmisión al receptor del trasplante.

Sin embargo, los datos contradicen directamente esta afirmación: el bloqueo se produjo tras los aranceles impuestos por Trump en mayo, lo que llevó a China a reemplazar el suministro estadounidense por soja brasileña y argentina. Tal y como recuerda la American Soybean Association y diversos analistas citados, la caída de exportaciones a China ya se había producido durante el primer mandato de Trump, cuando las importaciones chinas de soja de EE. UU. se desplomaron de 14.000 millones de dólares en 2016 a 3.100 millones en 2018. Tras la reintroducción de aranceles este año, China redujo aún más sus compras, pasando de 27 millones de toneladas en 2024 a solo 3 millones.

La Conselleria de Sanidad, por su parte, reconoce la demora, pero asegura que se ha reducido progresivamente desde la integración del servicio en radiología el pasado abril. Además, ha recordado que cualquier mujer que no haya recibido cita en el tiempo previsto puede solicitarla directamente.

Antes de la llegada europea, no existían templos, deidades superiores ni creencias en una vida después de la muerte. La estructura social se basaba en la comunidad, la memoria ancestral y el vínculo con la naturaleza. Fue en 1824 cuando el francés René Lesson introdujo por primera vez conceptos cristianos, marcando el inicio de una transformación espiritual. Más adelante, misioneros católicos y protestantes competirían por establecer su influencia, provocando tensiones entre los siete distritos tradicionales de la isla. Estas fricciones religiosas y políticas condujeron a que Rotuma solicitara su anexión al Reino Unido en 1879, completada dos años después. A pesar de la adopción del cristianismo, la identidad polinesia no desapareció: los rituales incorporados se fusionaron con las costumbres ancestrales, ge]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rotuma-una-sociedad-polinesia-que-vivio-siglos-sin-religion-organizada</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/rotuma-una-sociedad-polinesia-que-vivio-siglos-sin-religion-organizada</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 06:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El exfiscal general Álvaro García Ortiz recurrirá al Constitucional tras pedir la nulidad de su condena por filtración de datos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El exfiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, solicitará en los próximos días la nulidad de la sentencia dictada por el Tribunal Supremo que lo condena a dos años de inhabilitación por haber difundido presuntamente información reservada del empresario Alberto González Amador, pareja de la presidenta madrileña Isabel Díaz Ayuso.

El caso salió a la luz en 2019, cuando se detectó contaminación en el lagunaje de Saint-Jean-sur-Mayenne, atribuida inicialmente a un vertido aislado. Sin embargo, las pesquisas revelaron la existencia de una trama más amplia que ofrecía servicios de gestión de residuos a entidades públicas y privadas, desviando después los materiales recolectados a lugares no autorizados, como cursos de agua y campos agrícolas.

González Amador alegaba que la condena reciente al fiscal general del Estado, Álvaro García Ortiz, por la filtración de un correo electrónico suyo, demostraba una vulneración de sus derechos fundamentales, incluido el derecho a la defensa. Sin embargo, el Supremo considera que ese hecho no invalida los procedimientos en curso y que los jueces encargados de los casos sabrán actuar con profesionalidad y no utilizar como prueba dicha filtración.

La resolución, que cierra la vía a cualquier intento de nulidad, subraya además que González Amador no es un ciudadano anónimo sino una persona con notoriedad pública debido a su relación con Ayuso, negando el argumento de trato injusto por exposición mediática.

Este caso destaca por ser poco común, ya que normalmente no se presentan cargos únicamente por eliminar datos de un dispositivo móvil.

Bosch reconoce que la lógica de la sentencia respecto a la nota informativa emitida por la Fiscalía es correcta, ya que un fiscal no puede responder a una noticia falsa cometiendo un delito. Sin embargo, critica la valoración de la prueba, ya que numerosos periodistas de varios medios declararon que García Ortiz no fue su fuente, algo que dos magistradas del Supremo reflejaron en un voto particular muy crítico.

Estas medidas habrían debilitado las instituciones encargadas de proteger los derechos humanos y se han acompañado de una creciente represión de la protesta social.

Según fuentes penitenciarias, en 2024 se intervinieron 855 móviles y se espera que en 2025 se superen los mil. Sin embargo, un 40% de los internos sigue teniendo acceso a móviles, muchos de ellos modernos, lo que facilita la comunicación con el exterior y la organización de actividades ilícitas. Algunos presos utilizan los móviles únicamente para mantenerse en contacto con sus familias, mientras que otros continúan con negocios delictivos desde la prisión o participan en exhibicionismo carcelario, publicando fotos y vídeos en redes sociales y acumulando seguidores. Un caso destacado es el de Adrián Molina, conocido por sus fugas, que mantiene presencia activa en Instagram desde la cárcel. Esta situación pone en riesgo la seguridad interna y la gestión de las prisiones. Para combatirlo, el Departament de Justícia planea instalar inhibidores de señal que bloqueen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presencia-de-moviles-en-carceles-catalanas-riesgos-de-seguridad-y-exhibicionismo-en-redes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/presencia-de-moviles-en-carceles-catalanas-riesgos-de-seguridad-y-exhibicionismo-en-redes</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 01:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Javier Ruiz analiza la estrategia comunicativa de Ayuso ante el caso del Hospital de Torrejón]]></title><description><![CDATA[El periodista Javier Ruiz analizó en el programa 'Mañaneros 360' de RTVE la estrategia recurrente de Isabel Díaz Ayuso para esquivar los escándalos políticos que rodean a su gobierno. El análisis se centró en el reciente caso del Hospital de Torrejón de Ardoz, gestionado por el grupo sanitario Ribera, acusado de rechazar pacientes y reducir intervenciones no rentables para aumentar beneficios entre cuatro y cinco millones de euros. Según Ruiz, el jefe de Gabinete de Ayuso, Miguel Ángel Rodríguez, aplica un sistema de comunicación en tres fases siempre que surgen polémicas. El primero consiste en culpar a los medios de comunicación, acusándolos de mentir o de difundir informaciones manipuladas. El segundo paso apunta al 'Sanchismo', es decir, al Gobierno central y al PSOE, responsabilizándolos de orquestar campañas contra el Ejecutivo madrileño. Y como último recurso, el discurso recurre al tema de ETA y la vinculación de Pedro Sánchez con Bildu para desviar la atención.

El incidente comenzó tras una discusión entre ambos en una rotonda cercana a un centro comercial, donde el repartidor fue arrollado por la furgoneta. A pesar del impacto inicial, el trabajador logró mantenerse sujeto al vehículo, colocándose sobre el capó mientras la furgoneta se incorporaba a la autovía. Durante el trayecto, el conductor realizó maniobras peligrosas con la intención de hacer caer al motorista, generando un riesgo significativo tanto para él como para otros usuarios de la vía. Tras varios avisos, los agentes del destacamento de Tráfico de la Guardia Civil interceptaron la furgoneta.

Espinosa sostiene que los detalles del expediente fueron manipulados para dañar su reputación tras su salida de Vox y la creación de su nueva plataforma, Atenea. 

El Juzgado de Instrucción 13 de Madrid ha admitido la querella a trámite, citando a los investigados y solicitando a Vox el expediente completo, incluyendo registros de acceso, para esclarecer quién filtró la información.

Tras el reacoplamiento de la nave de carga Cygnus NG-23 el 1 de diciembre de 2025, la ISS albergó dos Soyuz (MS-27 y MS-28), una Crew Dragon tripulada, tres cargueros rusos Progress, una Dragon v2 de carga y una HTV-X japonesa. Marín explica que estos vehículos utilizan tres sistemas diferentes de acoplamiento, que no son directamente compatibles entre sí, reflejando la diversidad tecnológica entre los socios internacionales de la estación. 

En el segmento ruso se emplea el sistema SSVP de tipo cono-sonda, en uso desde los años setenta.

En primera instancia, el Juzgado de lo Penal número 3 de Tarragona la había condenado a dos años y medio de prisión, a la inhabilitación para ejercer la patria potestad durante seis años y medio y al pago de indemnizaciones. Sin embargo, la Audiencia ha considerado que existía una ‘causa justificada’ para no entregar a la menor, ya que la niña —actualmente de 15 años— manifestó repetidamente su negativa a vivir o mantener contacto con el progenitor custodio. Según el tribunal, tanto agentes policiales como técnicos del EAIA y otros servicios sociales avalaron que la menor rechazaba de forma constante acudir con su padre, lo que influyó en la decisión final.

Estas piezas, que formaban parte de la muestra 'Rabia mierda' expuesta en el Centro Social Okupado La Rosa, en Madrid, fueron acusadas de antisemitismo y señaladas mediáticamente antes incluso de su inauguración. Tras la polémica, los artistas decidieron retirar la exposición para evitar perjuicios al espacio. Sin embargo, la denuncia prosperó judicialmente, y los creadores fueron citados a declarar como investigados. Las obras —‘¿La solución?’ de Cabero, ‘Contra-Propaganda’ de Güell y ‘Estatados Israel’ de Maher— comparten un enfoque crítico hacia la violencia y las políticas del Estado de Israel, utilizando la ironía y la metáfora visual como recursos artísticos.

Hasta ahora los bancos solo estaban obligados a informar sobre movimientos superiores a 3.000 euros, pero con la nueva normativa cualquier ingreso recurrente, incluso de pequeñas cantidades, podrá ser examinado por Hacienda. La medida afecta especialmente a transferencias habituales entre particulares, como las ayudas mensuales que unos padres puedan hacer a sus hijos para pagar el alquiler o la hipoteca. Si estas aportaciones —por ejemplo, de 300 euros mensuales— no se devuelven, la Agencia Tributaria las considerará donaciones y, por tanto, estarán sujetas al impuesto correspondiente, aunque en muchas comunidades autónomas este esté bonificado.

Esta diferencia de actuación genera frustración entre los usuarios, especialmente cuando se bloquean recursos legítimos sin aviso ni información, ya que Telefónica no ofrece mensajes de advertencia ni identificación del origen del bloqueo, a diferencia de Digi.

Ferganá, una zona fértil y densamente poblada, ha sido históricamente un mosaico de pueblos túrquicos y persas, donde las delimitaciones soviéticas del siglo XX generaron auténticos quebraderos de cabeza: comunidades separadas por líneas arbitrarias, enclaves dentro de otros países y continuos conflictos por el agua y las tierras.

El informe destaca que esta tendencia se concentra en comunidades como Catalunya y Navarra, donde la sanidad privada tiene una presencia más relevante.

La Comunidad de Madrid confirmó que la causa ha sido un brote de influenza aviar de baja patogenicidad, aunque las imágenes y la elevada mortalidad observada apuntan a una situación más grave.

La medida busca aliviar la presión sobre el sector agrícola, un pilar clave de su base electoral, que se ha visto afectado por la reducción de las compras chinas y por el aumento de los costes de producción. 

Según el anuncio realizado en una mesa redonda en la Casa Blanca, la mayor parte de los fondos —unos 11.000 millones de dólares— procederán de un programa del Departamento de Agricultura denominado “asistencia puente a los granjeros”, destinado principalmente a productores de maíz, algodón, sorgo, soja, arroz, trigo, patatas y a ganaderos. El resto se dirigirá a productores de frutas, hortalizas y cultivos de especialidad no cubiertos por ese programa.

El incidente se produjo el 25 de noviembre en la sala de prensa del Congreso, donde Ndongo interrumpió reiteradamente a los periodistas y trató de formular preguntas a la portavoz de Sumar, Verónica Martínez, sin disponer del turno de palabra. Esta conducta, denunciada por obstaculizar el normal desarrollo de la rueda de prensa y el trabajo de los periodistas acreditados, se enmarca en un patrón de comportamiento reiterado que ya había generado quejas anteriores en la Cámara. La denuncia se apoya en el artículo 98.6 del reglamento reformado del Congreso, que sanciona la obstrucción o interrupción del orden durante las ruedas de prensa y considera muy graves las infracciones graves repetidas en el plazo de un año.

Nacido en Avilés en 1955, Martínez fue una figura clave en la evolución del rock nacional desde los años ochenta. Formó Ilegales en 1982 junto a David Alonso e Íñigo Ayestarán, alcanzando notoriedad por su sonido directo, provocador y letras afiladas. Su debut en 1983 marcó una época dentro de la Movida madrileña con temas que hoy son himnos del rock español como “Europa ha muerto” o “Revuelta juvenil en Mongolia”.
A lo largo de su carrera, Martínez mantuvo la esencia combativa y sarcástica de su obra, sin renunciar a la evolución musical del grupo, que experimentó con sonidos más elaborados en discos como “Chicos pálidos para la máquina” o “Todo está permitido”. En los noventa consolidó una formación estable junto a Alejandro Espina y Jaime Beláustegui, ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-jorge-martinez-historico-lider-de-ilegales-a-los-70-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fallece-jorge-martinez-historico-lider-de-ilegales-a-los-70-anos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 21:37:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Comunidad de Madrid interrumpe la publicación de auditorías y actas de reuniones con empresas gestoras de hospitales]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Consejería de Sanidad de la Comunidad de Madrid ha dejado de publicar desde 2021 las auditorías de los hospitales gestionados por las empresas privadas Quirónsalud y Ribera Salud.

El ataque se enmarca dentro de las continuas muertes de civiles palestinos desde que comenzó la ofensiva israelí en octubre de 2023. El Ejército israelí ha afirmado que las muertes de algunos de los civiles son consecuencia de su intento de atravesar la línea amarilla, la nueva zona controlada por las tropas israelíes.

En una entrevista concedida a la BBC World Service, la artista –que en 2009 representó a Israel junto a la cantante palestina Mira Awad con la canción *Must Be Another Way*– expresó su desacuerdo con los boicots culturales promovidos por algunos países, pero defendió que su país debería retirarse por decisión propia en señal de solidaridad con las víctimas del conflicto en Palestina e Israel. Noa consideró que la retirada temporal sería un gesto de humanidad y respeto hacia quienes sufren las consecuencias de la violencia, al tiempo que mostró su esperanza de que la próxima participación israelí en el certamen pueda celebrarse en un contexto de paz duradera y justicia para ambos pueblos. Pese a agradecer a la UER por mantener la inclusión de Israel en la edición de Viena 2026, la cantante insistió en que Eurovisión no debería ser un es]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/noa-propone-que-israel-se-retire-por-voluntad-propia-de-eurovision-2026-en-solidaridad-con-palestina</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/noa-propone-que-israel-se-retire-por-voluntad-propia-de-eurovision-2026-en-solidaridad-con-palestina</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:54:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La Fiscalía solicita 40 años de prisión para un hombre acusado de explotar sexualmente a su hijastra menor en Algaida]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Fiscalía de Palma solicita una condena total de 40 años de prisión para J.L.L., un hombre de 50 años acusado de someter a su hijastra menor de edad a abusos sexuales y servidumbre en una finca de Algaida, Mallorca. Según el escrito fiscal, el acusado conoció a la madre de la menor en un viaje a Nigeria en 2015 y se casó con ella con el único propósito de conseguir la documentación necesaria para traer a la niña a España. Durante varios años, el hombre viajó repetidamente a Nigeria, donde comenzó a abusar de la menor mediante tocamientos, exhibición de pornografía y manipulación psicológica. En 2019, la convenció para firmar un documento que la obligaba a mantener relaciones sexuales diarias y realizar tareas domésticas a cambio de su traslado a España. Una vez instalada en Mallorca, el acusado la aisló en una finca en Algaida, separándola de su madre y sometiéndola a frecuentes agresiones sexuales, controlando sus redes sociales y vigilándola con cámaras.

El disparo alcanzó de lleno al novio, miembro de la milicia Fuerzas de Apoyo Rápido de Sudán, quien murió en el acto o poco después en el hospital, según versiones contradictorias. El autor del disparo sería, presuntamente, su propio hermano, que había comenzado a disparar al aire como gesto festivo, siguiendo una costumbre extendida en celebraciones rurales del África central. El retroceso del arma provocó que una de las balas impactara directamente en el pecho del novio. Tras el accidente, el pánico y la confusión dieron paso a un enfrentamiento armado entre familiares y asistentes, muchos de ellos también armados, que creyeron se trataba de un ataque intencionado. El intercambio de disparos se saldó con al menos 57 personas muertas, según medios locales.

A pesar de la falta de pruebas claras, el Tribunal Supremo ha declarado culpable al Fiscal, lo que ha generado un clima de desconfianza en la justicia española. La situación se ha complicado por las acusaciones de manipulación de pruebas y desvío de fondos, con vínculos a figuras políticas de la derecha. La ciudadanía ha mostrado su frustración, exigiendo justicia y una mayor transparencia. La situación se ha convertido en un problema internacional para la imagen de la democracia española, que podría ver afectada su reputación en foros europeos e internacionales. La sentencia podría ser anulada, pero las consecuencias para los involucrados parecen ser aún inciertas.

Esta medida forma parte de una revisión de la Directiva de Sustancias Prioritarias, cuyo objetivo, según las instituciones europeas, es actualizar y armonizar los estándares de calidad del agua. Sin embargo, organizaciones ecologistas como Ecologistas en Acción alertan de que la propuesta representa un grave riesgo para la biodiversidad y la salud pública, ya que permitiría legalizar la contaminación existente en muchas masas de agua, especialmente en España, donde un tercio de los recursos hídricos ya están afectados por este herbicida.

Hasta ahora, los desempleados podían recibir ayudas de forma vitalicia, algo que desaparecerá progresivamente a partir de 2026. Aquellos que llevan más de 20 años en paro perderán sus prestaciones de inmediato, seguidos por quienes superen los dos años, salvo en contadas excepciones. El Gobierno de Bart De Wever busca recuperar mano de obra activa, aumentar las cotizaciones y disminuir el déficit público, estimado en un 5,3% para 2025. La reforma incluye un mayor control de las bajas por enfermedad, obligando a quienes lleven más de un año incapacitados a justificar de forma frecuente su imposibilidad de trabajar.

En ellas, el exmonarca admite haber intentado evadir impuestos y reconoce infidelidades, aunque justifica sus actos considerándolos parte de la tradición monárquica. Se muestra como víctima de la frialdad de su entorno y de las investigaciones del Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, al que acusa de promover una 'caza de brujas'. Juan Carlos I expresa veneración por Francisco Franco, a quien califica de 'inteligente y austero', y describe la Guerra Civil de manera equidistante, ignorando su carácter de golpe militar contra la República. Además, se atribuye el mérito de la Transición y de la creación de símbolos culturales como los premios Cervantes y Príncipe de Asturias.

España era el tercer país que más audiencia aportaba al certamen, solo por detrás de Alemania y el Reino Unido, con más de 5,8 millones de espectadores en la final de la última edición. Junto con las retiradas de Países Bajos, Irlanda y Eslovenia, el concurso perderá cerca de 9 millones de televidentes y más de 16 millones si se cuentan las semifinales. En el ámbito financiero, la marcha de España, miembro del Big Five, reducirá significativamente los ingresos del festival, que ahora quedará en manos de un ‘Big Four’.

Estos bocadillos consisten en un pan relleno de picadillo, un tipo de chorizo asturiano. Se preparan de forma sencilla pero deliciosa, y son perfectos para disfrutar en cualquier ocasión, como espichas o excursiones al aire libre. La receta básica implica la preparación de una masa a base de harina de fuerza, agua tibia, huevo, levadura, y aceite de oliva. Una vez que la masa fermenta, se divide en pequeñas porciones que se rellenan con picadillo, para luego ser horneadas hasta alcanzar un dorado perfecto. Es un plato que se conserva bien durante varios días, por lo que resulta ideal para llevar a cualquier evento. Además, la versatilidad de este plato permite usar diferentes rellenos, como queso Cabrales, panceta o bacon, lo que da lugar a variantes deliciosas.

El análisis financiero muestra que Ribera Salud obtuvo más de 31 millones de euros de beneficios entre 2009 y 2021, mientras el sistema público asumía sobrecostes mediante pagos complementarios y expedientes de enriquecimiento injusto.

Según Palomera, el origen de su caída política estaría en su enfrentamiento con la empresa Quirón, a la que la Comunidad de Madrid debía 40 millones de euros. Palomera también señala que esta deuda fue rechazada por Cifuentes, lo que desencadenó una serie de filtraciones que incluyeron el famoso video en el que Cifuentes aparecía hurtando cremas. La periodista expone que el PP, desde su sede en Génova 13, manipuló la información para dañar la imagen de la política madrileña. Además, destaca el estrecho vínculo entre Quirón y figuras del PP, como Isabel Díaz Ayuso, quien ha transferido grandes sumas de dinero a esta compañía.

Esta práctica supondría una infravaloración del trabajo de enfermería y, según las trabajadoras, pondría en riesgo la seguridad de los pacientes. 
El Sindicato de Enfermería (SATSE) de Madrid ya denunció en abril estas instrucciones calificándolas de 'riesgo inaceptable', ya que violan los protocolos médicos y rompen la coherencia del triaje.

Según el experto, la promesa de un aditivo capaz de proteger el motor durante 15.000 kilómetros carece de fundamento, ya que ningún aditivo puede permanecer adherido al depósito con ese efecto prolongado. Joseba también calificó de errónea la prueba en la que Gaitán mezcla agua con combustible, explicando que el resultado —emulsionar el agua— es perjudicial, pues un aditivo real debería hacer lo contrario: separar el agua para evitar daños en el motor.

El resultado es lo que él llama la 'mierdificación' de Internet, un fenómeno ya extendido a sectores como la alimentación, el transporte o la sanidad.

Debido a las dificultades económicas que enfrentaba, incluso tuvo que vender su casa y propiedades para cuidar de su esposa enferma. La historia de Ed fue compartida por Samuel Weidenhofer, un creador de contenido con más de 2,3 millones de seguidores en Instagram, quien abrió una campaña de recaudación de fondos en GoFundMe. Gracias a la generosidad de miles de personas anónimas, se recaudaron 1,77 millones de dólares (1,5 millones de euros), una de las mayores recaudaciones individuales de la plataforma. En un emotivo momento, Ed recibió el cheque, visiblemente emocionado, agradeciendo a todos los que hicieron posible este gesto. Esta historia destaca la solidaridad de la sociedad y la difícil situación que enfrentan muchos adultos mayores, especialmente veteranos, que no cuentan con un sistema de pensiones ad]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-veterano-de-88-anos-recibe-una-donacion-millonaria-tras-anos-de-trabajo-para-pagar-sus-deudas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-veterano-de-88-anos-recibe-una-donacion-millonaria-tras-anos-de-trabajo-para-pagar-sus-deudas</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 15:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La arquitectura como resistencia ante las fronteras urbanas y sociales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo escrito por Santiago Cirugeda reflexiona sobre el concepto de frontera más allá de su sentido geopolítico. El autor plantea que las fronteras no se limitan a muros o alambradas, sino que también se levantan en el interior de las ciudades, separando comunidades por razones económicas, culturales o sociales. Cirugeda denuncia que el urbanismo institucional, con sus reglas y concursos arquitectónicos, puede actuar como un mecanismo de exclusión más que de integración. A través de su experiencia con el colectivo Recetas Urbanas, defiende un enfoque participativo de la arquitectura que ponga a las personas en el centro, promoviendo proyectos que respondan a necesidades reales aunque queden fuera de los procesos oficiales. El texto destaca ejemplos de iniciativas que desafían esas limitaciones: comedores escolares autoconstruidos, aulas abiertas que rompen estereotipos de género o procesos de autorehabilitación que empoderan a comunidades vulnerables.

Un panadero fue arrestado tras un video viral donde incitaba a la violencia contra los brasileños, lo que llevó a denuncias de grupos de abogados. Además, un juez en Lisboa envió a prisión a un individuo por amenazar de muerte a una periodista brasileña. El fenómeno de la xenofobia ha crecido, con un aumento en las denuncias de discriminación, especialmente hacia la comunidad brasileña, que es la más numerosa entre los inmigrantes en el país. La situación empeora debido a los discursos políticos xenófobos promovidos por partidos ultraderechistas, lo que alimenta un ambiente de hostilidad. A pesar de las iniciativas de sensibilización, el miedo a denunciar y la desprotección legal siguen siendo barreras para los inmigrantes.

El temblor, que se sintió en varias localidades cercanas y en regiones vecinas como Burgos, Navarra y La Rioja, duró solo unos segundos y causó pánico entre los residentes, quienes se asomaron a las ventanas o salieron a las calles por temor a réplicas. Sin embargo, las autoridades aseguraron que no se esperarían réplicas significativas. El temblor generó 143 llamadas al Centro de Coordinación de Emergencias, muchas de ellas relacionadas con los mensajes automáticos de alerta enviados por los teléfonos móviles. Afortunadamente, no se han reportado daños personales ni materiales hasta el momento, y se mantiene la calma en la región. A pesar de que el evento ha sido inusual para la zona, las autoridades piden a la población que siga únicamente las instrucciones oficial]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/terremoto-leve-de-magnitud-4-sacude-alava-sin-danos-importantes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/terremoto-leve-de-magnitud-4-sacude-alava-sin-danos-importantes</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 14:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Graves deficiencias laborales y asistenciales en el Hospital de Torrejón gestionado por Ribera Salud]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Hospital Universitario de Torrejón, gestionado por Ribera Salud bajo un modelo de concesión pública con gestión privada, se enfrenta a una crisis de personal y denuncias por prácticas que priorizan el ahorro económico frente a la calidad asistencial. En mayo de 2025, 260 trabajadores firmaron un manifiesto donde alertaban de una gestión deficiente, alta rotación de personal y un clima laboral deteriorado. Muchos empleados dimitieron por las condiciones precarias, lo que ha obligado al hospital a contratar constantemente personal a través de una web privada. Entre las irregularidades más graves destacan el uso de un único anestesista para dos quirófanos, la utilización del quirófano de urgencias para operaciones programadas —bloqueando su disponibilidad en casos críticos—, y la presencia reducida de médicos con título MIR en el servicio de urgencias, que en ocasiones queda atendido por facultativos sin formación completa.

La historia comienza con la observación de unas hormigas ambarinas procedentes del planeta Mirmidón, liberadas en un oasis ecuatorial. En lugar de construir sus característicos hormigueros aéreos, las hormigas desaparecen bajo tierra y comienzan a excavar un complejo laberinto tridimensional. A través de un visor sinestésico, los personajes Lem, Casandra, Chess y AsimoV contemplan la actividad frenética de los insectos, lo que da pie a una conversación sobre el planeta Flora. Según Casandra, en Flora no existen flores ni vegetación. Su superficie es una enorme megalópolis continua habitada por humanos ociosos que se han fundido con las viviendas y ciudades inteligentes en un único 'urbionte'.

La concentración, según estimaciones oficiales, congregó a cientos de miles de personas procedentes de distintos estados del país. En su discurso, Sheinbaum destacó los logros de su gobierno en materia de programas sociales, infraestructura y seguridad, subrayando la continuidad del proyecto político iniciado por su predecesor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador. 

El acto tuvo también una clara dimensión política: servir de demostración de fuerza frente a la oposición y a las críticas de ciertos sectores que han cuestionado su forma de ejercer el poder y su cercanía con el anterior presidente.

A través de una investigación minuciosa, basada en fuentes primarias y documentos inéditos, Guillamón critica la burocratización de los comités de la CNT y su adaptación al Estado republicano, un giro que, según él, facilitó la contrarrevolución. La obra también examina la fractura interna del movimiento anarquista, destacando la resistencia de sectores minoritarios como los 'incontrolados' y los Amigos de Durruti, quienes se opusieron a la rendición ante el poder estatal. Guillamón destaca la derrota de la revolución, no solo en el campo militar, sino dentro de las propias organizaciones anarquistas, que renunciaron a destruir el Estado en favor de la unidad antifascista. El autor ofrece una visión crítica y apasionada, desmitificando la historia heroica del movimiento libertario y recalcando la importancia de estas luchas internas ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-de-cnt-versus-ait-de-agustin-guillamon-burocracia-y-contradicciones-internas-en-el-anarquismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-de-cnt-versus-ait-de-agustin-guillamon-burocracia-y-contradicciones-internas-en-el-anarquismo</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 13:05:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La guerra interna en el mundo MAGA entre islamófobos y pro-israelíes]]></title><description><![CDATA[La confrontación dentro del mundo MAGA ha alcanzado un punto álgido con acusaciones graves entre figuras prominentes del movimiento, como Tucker Carlson y Ted Cruz, sobre el apoyo a Qatar e Israel, así como acusaciones de comportamientos inapropiados.

Los comentarios de Carlson en un foro de Doha, en el que expresó su admiración por Qatar, desencadenaron una serie de insultos y ataques entre los miembros del movimiento, incluyendo una respuesta de Cruz sobre las prohibiciones en Qatar. A su vez, otros miembros ultra del bando anti-Israel, como Candace Owens y Marjorie Taylor Greene, se vieron involucrados en las críticas a los defensores del Estado judío dentro del Partido Republicano.

Según explicó, la CPI ya probó este tipo de procedimiento en el caso del líder insurgente ugandés Joseph Kony, cuya audiencia se celebró en ausencia. Aunque el proceso es complejo, Niang destacó su utilidad para avanzar en los casos y preservar pruebas esenciales.

Las órdenes de arresto emitidas contra Putin y Netanyahu por presuntos crímenes de guerra y de lesa humanidad no han podido ejecutarse debido a que la Corte no cuenta con una fuerza policial propia y depende de la cooperación de los Estados miembros, algo poco probable tratándose de dos líderes en ejercicio con fuerte respaldo político interno.

Stiglitz, junto con Andrew Kosenko, argumenta que la Unión Europea está desaprovechando una oportunidad clave para influir en el curso de la guerra en Ucrania: utilizar los 300.000 millones de dólares en activos rusos congelados para financiar la defensa y recuperación del país agredido. A casi cuatro años del inicio de la invasión rusa, Ucrania necesita urgentemente apoyo económico tras la devastación de sus infraestructuras y la parálisis de su economía. Los autores proponen que los fondos sean destinados a un «préstamo de reparación» de 210.000 millones de euros, que Kiev sólo debería devolver si Rusia compensa los daños causados. El dinero, gestionado por la institución financiera Euroclear, podría invertirse en bonos europeos con calificación AAA, evitando cualquier conflicto legal de confiscación. Stiglitz insiste en que este mecanismo sería temporal, legalmente sólido y moralmente necesario, recordando que Rusia ha violado la Carta de las Naciones Unidas ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ue-debe-usar-los-fondos-rusos-congelados-para-apoyar-a-ucrania-segun-stiglitz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-ue-debe-usar-los-fondos-rusos-congelados-para-apoyar-a-ucrania-segun-stiglitz</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2025 12:11:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alejandro Bodart absuelto por sus tuits políticos sobre Palestina e Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[El dirigente de izquierda Alejandro Bodart fue absuelto por la Cámara de Casación de la Ciudad tras ser condenado por tuits en los que criticaba al Estado de Israel y apoyaba la causa palestina. La Corte consideró que sus expresiones estaban protegidas por la libertad de expresión, diferenciando entre antisionismo y antisemitismo. El caso se centró en tres tuits publicados en 2022, donde Bodart utilizaba términos como 'Estado racista y genocida de Israel' y defendía al pueblo palestino. Los jueces afirmaron que esas opiniones no incitaban al odio o la persecución, sino que constituían una crítica política legítima. Además, destacaron que el dirigente, como figura pública, tenía un mayor umbral de tolerancia ante la crítica y que la libertad de expresión debe amparar incluso las ideas que resultan controvertidas o perturbadoras para determinados sectores.

Durante su estancia en la megacárcel de Bukele, conocida como Cecot, Palencia fue torturado y maltratado junto a otros migrantes, a pesar de ser inocente. En un acuerdo entre Donald Trump y Nayib Bukele, más de 200 migrantes fueron enviados a El Salvador sin pruebas que demostraran su vinculación con el crimen. La denuncia de Palencia se suma a la de otros migrantes que vivieron violaciones de derechos humanos en el Cecot, un centro de detención conocido por su brutalidad. Tras meses de sufrimiento y torturas, finalmente fue liberado gracias a un canje entre gobiernos, pero la experiencia dejó profundas secuelas físicas y psicológicas.

La presidenta de la Conferencia de Rectores de las Universidades Españolas (CRUE), Eva Alcón, destacó que muchas becas no son suficientes para cubrir estos altos precios, lo que genera una brecha entre los estudiantes con menos recursos y los de familias con mayores posibilidades económicas. Por ello, Alcón pidió una revisión de las becas para que se dirijan a los estudiantes que realmente lo necesitan, sugiriendo una expansión de las becas salario.

Thiel ha difundido ideas sobre el Anticristo y el fin de los tiempos en charlas privadas y foros católicos, reinterpretando la política global como una lucha espiritual entre el bien y el mal. Los autores, Rory Rowan y Tristan Sturm, sostienen que esta 'geopolítica apocalíptica' convierte conflictos sociales y económicos en batallas metafísicas que justifican el uso extremo de la violencia y protegen los intereses de las élites tecnocapitalistas.

El texto conecta esta visión con la influencia del jurista nazi Carl Schmitt, quien concebía la historia como una disputa entre el Anticristo y el 'Katechon', una fuerza que retarda el fin del mundo.

El hallazgo fue realizado por un pastor que, al encontrar la piedra tallada mientras cuidaba su rebaño, avisó rápidamente a la Dirección del Museo de Fethiye. Los expertos confirmaron su relevancia histórica y, dada la dificultad del terreno y el peso de unos 300 kilos, decidieron enterrarla temporalmente para protegerla e instalar cámaras con sensor de movimiento. Posteriormente, un equipo de arqueólogos y trabajadores recorrió a pie durante siete horas un terreno escarpado para trasladar el objeto hasta un punto accesible. La pieza, de tipología típica de los siglos I al III d. C., presenta relieves que muestran a un hombre y una mujer, lo que sugiere una representación familiar en honor a los difuntos.

Mann parte de su condición de exiliado en Estados Unidos para examinar con distancia crítica la evolución de su país, al que considera atrapado entre el genio artístico y la tentación demoníaca. A lo largo del ensayo, describe la tensión entre el cosmopolitismo y el provincialismo que caracteriza la identidad alemana, y reconoce la responsabilidad colectiva de los alemanes en las tragedias que han marcado su historia. La figura de Lutero ocupa un lugar central como símbolo del espíritu alemán: monumental, contradictorio, profundo y a la vez reaccionario.

Entre las instalaciones afectadas se encuentra Iron Mountain, una empresa con un historial controvertido de incendios, varios de los cuales fueron intencionales. La tragedia de Ezeiza revive las sospechas sobre las operaciones de Iron Mountain, cuya presencia en la localidad no es nueva. En 2014, un incendio en una de sus naves dejó 10 muertos. Además, en al menos cinco ocasiones la empresa ha estado vinculada a incendios provocados en diferentes países, incluida Argentina, donde en 1993 murieron nueve bomberos.

En la Península y Baleares se alternaron patrones de depresión del golfo de Génova, dorsal atlántica y bloqueo escandinavo, lo que dio lugar a lluvias persistentes, tormentas y episodios de fuerte convección, especialmente en el noreste y sureste peninsular. En Roquetas de Mar se produjo una tromba de agua que causó inundaciones y el rescate de una persona. El fin de semana, la borrasca ex-Gabrielle trajo lluvias intensas y muy concentradas en Extremadura, el Ebro y el litoral valenciano, alcanzándose 55 mm en 20 minutos en el aeropuerto de Valencia.

Las temperaturas descendieron de forma acusada respecto a la semana anterior, con una reducción media de 6,6 °C en la Península y Baleares, y de 6,8 °C en Canarias.

El partido de extrema derecha busca restar apoyo a Isabel Díaz Ayuso, presidenta de la región y líder del Partido Popular, tratando de presentarse como la voz de los barrios frente a lo que describen como el 'Madrid de los espectáculos' impulsado por el PP. Vox pretende conectar con los votantes descontentos con las políticas de Ayuso en materia de vivienda, transporte y servicios públicos, especialmente en los distritos del sur y del este de la capital.

El reportaje detalla cómo la formación de Santiago Abascal intenta capitalizar el descontento vecinal ante los altos precios de la vivienda, el aumento de la precariedad y las desigualdades territoriales que separan a los barrios obreros del norte más próspero.

En su libro *El sentido de la Naturaleza* (Anagrama, 2025), Pecere reflexiona sobre el papel del viaje en la formación del pensamiento y la conexión con la naturaleza, pero también sobre cómo el turismo contemporáneo refleja desigualdades y contradicciones del capitalismo global. Sostiene que el auténtico viaje implica conocer otras formas de vida y poner en cuestión los propios hábitos, no reproducir el confort urbano en cualquier parte del mundo. Critica el 'efecto Medusa' que el turismo masivo provoca en ciudades como Roma o Barcelona, donde el centro se vacía de vida local, y advierte del elitismo de un turismo sostenible reservado solo a los más ricos.

Según la patronal Asime (Asociación de Industriales Metalúrgicos de Galicia), una de cada cinco empresas del sector se ha visto obligada a rechazar pedidos porque ya trabaja al límite de su capacidad productiva y no encuentra personal suficiente. Actualmente, el sector tiene más de 5.000 vacantes sin cubrir en toda la comunidad, en una amplia variedad de perfiles técnicos: desde soldadores, caldereros y electromecánicos hasta delineantes, ingenieros y especialistas en áreas tecnológicas relacionadas con la automatización, la ciberseguridad o el análisis de datos.

Según la investigación de la Oficina Nacional Anticorrupción de Ucrania (NABU), la llamada Operación Midas habría revelado un desvío de hasta 100 millones de dólares procedentes de contratos públicos de la empresa estatal Energoatom. Entre los implicados figuran Timur Mindich, amigo personal de Zelenski y antiguo copropietario de Kvartal 95 Studio, junto a otros colaboradores próximos como Oleksandr Tsukerman y el exviceprimer ministro Oleksiy Chernyshov. 

El texto indica que Mindich y Tsukerman huyeron a Israel antes de ser imputados y que ambos poseen nacionalidad israelí, lo que dificulta cualquier extradición.

Hernández, considerado hasta ahora la mano derecha de Salazar, fue mencionado por las denunciantes como supuesto cómplice o encubridor de las conductas del exasesor, aunque siempre negó los hechos. Además, abandona su puesto en la Ejecutiva del PSOE andaluz, donde era responsable de la Secretaría de Datos, Análisis y Prospectiva.

Con más de 4.700 templos en España, el auge de estas iglesias está estrechamente vinculado a los flujos migratorios procedentes de América Latina. Este fenómeno ha arraigado especialmente en los barrios periféricos, donde comunidades latinoamericanas, gitanas y personas en situación de vulnerabilidad hallan espacios de apoyo espiritual y social. Según la Federación de Entidades Religiosas Evangélicas (FEREDE), el auge evangélico se debe también al trabajo de base en comunidades marginales desde los años 60 y 80.

El resultado ha sido un fuerte incremento en los precios: los alquileres subieron hasta un 360% en algunas regiones y un 45,5% interanual en Buenos Aires, mientras muchos contratos se pactan directamente en dólares, una moneda a la que la mayoría de los trabajadores no tiene acceso. La medida ha dejado a millones de inquilinos atrapados en una espiral de deuda, endeudamiento y precariedad.

Las víctimas fueron arrastradas por el mar en la piscina natural de la zona. El operativo de emergencia, que incluye a la Guardia Civil, Bomberos y Salvamento Marítimo, trabaja para localizar al desaparecido, aunque las condiciones del mar y la baja luminosidad dificultan la búsqueda. Además, varias personas resultaron heridas, una de ellas de gravedad, y tuvieron que ser trasladadas a hospitales.

Los investigadores analizaron 45 años de datos de la isla Macquarie, un enclave entre Tasmania y la Antártida, y constataron que las lluvias anuales han crecido un 28 % desde 1979, mucho más de lo estimado por los modelos climáticos previos. Este incremento no se debe a un mayor número de tormentas, sino a que las tormentas actuales descargan más lluvia cuando ocurren. Este fenómeno intensifica la entrada de agua dulce en la capa superior del océano, modificando su salinidad, reduciendo la mezcla entre capas y alterando las corrientes oceánicas. En 2023, los científicos estiman que esta lluvia adicional equivale a unas 2.300 gigatoneladas de agua dulce, diez veces más que la aportación reciente del deshielo antártico.

Aunque una gran parte de la población se considera católica, pocos practican de manera regular, ya que solo un 17% asiste a ceremonias religiosas con frecuencia. La secularización de la sociedad española también se refleja en la disminución de prácticas tradicionales, como el bautizo de hijos o la primera comunión.

Según el texto, estas redes paramilitares, en particular las vinculadas a organizaciones como UNA-UNSO, habrían desempeñado un papel clave durante los sucesos del Maidán en febrero de 2014, cuando la revuelta contra el gobierno de Víktor Yanukóvich culminó en un cambio de régimen respaldado por Occidente.

Según la investigación, el modelo de gestión público-privada impulsado en Galicia convirtió a la comunidad en un laboratorio de políticas que favorecerían a las grandes corporaciones sanitarias, como Quirónsalud y Ribera Salud, en detrimento de la sanidad pública. El texto señala el origen de este enfoque en las reformas impulsadas por José María Romay Beccaría y Manuel Fraga, que permitieron la concertación entre el sector público y privado. Durante la presidencia de Feijóo, los recortes presupuestarios, el cierre de camas y la externalización de servicios agravaron las carencias asistenciales en provincias como Ourense y Pontevedra, donde se consolidaron redes empresariales vinculadas al poder político.

García criticó duramente el modelo sanitario de la Comunidad de Madrid y el papel del grupo Quirón en la gestión privada, señalando que se ha convertido en un negocio sostenido por fondos públicos. Recordó que en 2020, de los 3.000 millones destinados a la covid, 1.300 millones fueron a pagar la deuda con este grupo, lo que para ella demuestra la in]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-garcia-propone-una-ley-para-eliminar-la-gestion-privada-en-centros-publicos-de-salud</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/monica-garcia-propone-una-ley-para-eliminar-la-gestion-privada-en-centros-publicos-de-salud</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 19:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gerardo Roger reclama un Sistema Nacional de Vivienda pública y critica la falta de voluntad política frente a la crisis habitacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[El arquitecto y urbanista Gerardo Roger, exdirector general de Urbanismo de la Generalitat Valenciana, defiende la creación de un Sistema Nacional de Vivienda similar al Sistema Nacional de Salud. A su juicio, España sufre una grave carencia de parque público —apenas un 2,5% frente al 25% de Viena— y urge establecer una empresa pública que promueva vivienda en alquiler asequible. Roger denuncia que la burocracia urbanística y la falta de voluntad política bloquean la solución al problema habitacional. Critica que la tramitación de los planes urbanísticos supera hoy los 15 años, mientras que en los años ochenta se completaban en cinco o seis. Para él, el origen del deterioro del urbanismo español está en la expansión urbanística desmedida de 1998-2007, impulsada por la 'Ley del Todo Urbanizable' del PP, que generó especulación y corrupción.

La polémica surgió cuando miembros fundadores y veteranos del partido denunciaron públicamente irregularidades en la gestión de las donaciones destinadas a la DANA. Elsa Almeda, Javier Esteban y Arturo Villarroya fueron algunos de los que abandonaron la organización, acusando a su presidente, Jaime Hernández Zúñiga, y a colaboradores cercanos de opacidad y control excesivo sobre la asociación. Según sus comunicados, no se habían convocado asambleas ni presentado cuentas durante más de dos años, lo que derivó en denuncias ante la Fiscalía por presunta estafa y apropiación de fondos. En su defensa, miembros afines a HazteOír y CitizenGo, entre ellos Raúl Muñiz, acusaron a Vox de intentar controlar la asociación, calificando las críticas de difamación.

A través de ejemplos concretos como Alonso, Amorim, Kompany, Luis Enrique, Maresca o Arteta, el autor analiza cómo muchos técnicos actuales creen que su conocimiento y sus planes de partido son más determinantes que el talento individual o la inspiración colectiva de los jugadores. Roldán argumenta que esta visión deriva en un fútbol encorsetado, excesivamente conceptual, donde los entrenadores intentan justificar sus decisiones con discursos didácticos o intelectuales para otorgarse relevancia. Contrapone esta actitud con la humildad de figuras como Carlo Ancelotti, quien reconoce que en los momentos clave el mérito pertenece a los jugadores y que el papel del técnico debe limitarse a facilitar, no a interferir.

La autora repasa los escándalos financieros, éticos y políticos del emérito y los presenta como ejemplos de una institución que disfruta de impunidad e inviolabilidad jurídica amparada por la Constitución de 1978. Concostrina recuerda que el texto constitucional otorga al rey inmunidad total, criticando que quienes están al margen de la ley participen incluso en su ratificación, como ocurrió en el referéndum de 1978.

Este partido, que podría duplicar sus escaños en las elecciones regionales, se apoya principalmente en hombres jóvenes y votantes con niveles educativos bajos. Un 49,6% de quienes votaron a Vox en 2023 solo contaban con la Educación Secundaria Obligatoria, un dato que sugiere una fuerte correlación entre nivel educativo y respaldo al partido de ultraderecha.

Los expertos Luis Miller (CSIC) y Aner Ansorena coinciden en que el crecimiento de Vox refleja tendencias nacionales más que factores locales. Entre las causas apuntan el desencanto de una parte de los hombres jóvenes, que se sienten marginados por las políticas de igualdad, así como la viralización de contenidos populistas en plataformas como TikTok.

El equipo de investigación descubrió que al transformar solicitudes peligrosas o ilegales en poesía, se logra un alto índice de éxito, incluso hasta 18 veces más en comparación con solicitudes directas. Esto se debe a que los modelos de IA más grandes, como ChatGPT, son más vulnerables a este tipo de 'hackeo poético', lo que plantea serios riesgos, como la creación de malware o el desarrollo de armas químicas. Este hallazgo resalta la necesidad urgente de fortalecer la seguridad en los sistemas de IA, especialmente para cumplir con la Ley Europea de la IA, cuyo cumplimiento se hará obligatorio en 2026.

Los trabajadores que denunciaron estas prácticas fueron despedidos y se suman otras acusaciones, como el uso repetido de material médico de un solo uso. El Gobierno regional, presidido por Isabel Díaz Ayuso, reaccionó con retraso, minimizando el caso y atribuyéndolo a “rencillas entre directivos”. Paralelamente, el debate se amplifica por las conexiones entre el grupo Quirón —principal contratista sanitario de la Comunidad— y Alberto González Amador, pareja de Ayuso, investigado judicialmente por corrupción en los negocios y fraude fiscal.

El PSOE denuncia que el Ayuntamiento, bajo el control de José Manuel Rey Varela, pretende colocarla en un lugar apartado y de difícil acceso, lo que podría invisibilizar el homenaje. Los socialistas señalan que el acto es una cuestión de dignidad histórica y reparadora, ya que la figura de Pablo Iglesias fue clave en la historia del socialismo y el movimiento obrero español. Aunque la placa fue inicialmente respaldada por el alcalde, después se han presentado obstáculos y se ha decidido que la placa no se ubique en un lugar central y visible, sino en un parque alejado.

El artículo 206 de la Ley Hipotecaria equiparaba a la Iglesia con el Estado, y en 1998 el gobierno de Aznar amplió el alcance a lugares de culto.

Arendt, nacida en Alemania en 1906 y refugiada del nazismo, dedicó su obra a analizar las raíces del totalitarismo, la libertad y la naturaleza del mal. Su célebre concepto de la “banalidad del mal” surgió a partir del juicio de Adolf Eichmann, al que describió como un burócrata obediente más que como un monstruo. Esta tesis, ampliamente debatida, puso en cuestión la idea de que solo los malvados conscientes cometen atrocidades, subrayando en cambio cómo ciudadanos comunes pueden participar en crímenes terribles sin reflexionar sobre sus actos. Además, el artículo destaca otras vertientes de su pensamiento, como la noción de natalidad y la defensa de la política como espacio de acción y esperanza.

Este modelo surgió cuando las grandes empresas de mensajería comenzaron a ofrecer a las tiendas locales una colaboración: recibir y entregar paquetes a cambio de una compensación económica mínima pero con la ventaja de atraer nuevos clientes. En Madrid, la mercería Baby, dirigida por Natividad Gómez, es un ejemplo claro. Gracias a esta actividad, ha logrado mantener un flujo constante de clientes, aunque reconoce que el trabajo añadido es agotador. En toda España, el comercio minorista se ha visto golpeado desde 2008, y entre 2019 y 2024 se cerraron cerca de 50.000 tiendas físicas. Al mismo tiempo, las ventas por internet crecieron un 95%, lo que empujó a muchas de estas pequeñas empresas a adaptarse o desaparecer.

Las empresas logísticas, como Seur, Correos y Amazon, también se benefician del modelo al reducir costes de reparto y aumen]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-puntos-de-recogida-revitalizan-los-pequenos-comercios-aunque-aumentan-su-carga-de-trabajo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-puntos-de-recogida-revitalizan-los-pequenos-comercios-aunque-aumentan-su-carga-de-trabajo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 13:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Guardiola responde a Abascal: 'Vox tiene que guardarse sus presiones machistas']]></title><description><![CDATA[La presidenta de Extremadura, María Guardiola, ha respondido con firmeza a las declaraciones de Santiago Abascal, líder de Vox, que había insinuado que el PP debería plantearse un cambio de candidata si no conseguía el apoyo de Vox.

A través de ejemplos de baterías, motores y módulos de carga, se pone de manifiesto que los modelos más baratos, como el Dacia Spring, presentan repuestos más caros que los vehículos de alta gama como el Tesla S Plaid. Se critica la política de precios de las marcas, especialmente de las coreanas y las italianofrancesas, que inflan el coste de piezas fundamentales como los motores y las baterías. Además, el autor subraya la falta de opciones de reparación independiente debido a las restricciones impuestas por los fabricantes, lo que obliga a los propietarios a recurrir a concesionarios para realizar reparaciones costosas. Esta situación podría fomentar el achatarramiento prematuro de los coches y un desperdicio de recursos económicos y ecológicos, ya que reparar un vehículo podría superar el valor del propio coche.

La dependencia de la construcción ha disminuido y el turismo, aunque relevante, ya no es el único motor. El sistema financiero es más robusto, los hogares están menos endeudados y la balanza exterior se ha equilibrado. No obstante, persisten desafíos como el desempleo estructural, la productividad estancada y una deuda pública alta.

Durante gran parte del siglo XX, incluso los líderes republicanos, desde Richard Nixon hasta Donald Trump, defendieron en mayor o menor medida la idea de ampliar la cobertura del seguro médico. Sin embargo, la situación ha cambiado radicalmente con la llamada 'One Big Ugly Bill', firmada por Trump en julio de 2025, que según estimaciones de KFF dejará a 17 millones de personas sin seguro médico para 2034, principalmente por los recortes a Medicaid.

Aunque la segunda etapa alcanzó la órbita con éxito, la primera etapa sufrió un fallo al intentar aterrizar, estrellándose contra la plataforma situada en el desierto de Gansú. Este lanzamiento es significativo porque el Zhuque 3 se une al creciente número de cohetes reutilizables en China, un sector cada vez más competitivo. A pesar del fallo en el aterrizaje, este avance muestra que LandSpace se adelanta a muchas iniciativas gubernamentales del país en cuanto a reutilización de etapas. Con una capacidad de carga de hasta 13,8 toneladas en órbita baja y el uso de metano y oxígeno líquidos como propelentes, el Zhuque 3 es una promesa para el futuro de los lanzamientos espaciales comerciales en China.

Este caso reabre el debate sobre la privatización de la gestión sanitaria en España, especialmente a través de los contratos de colaboración público-privada (CPP). El autor, Julio González García, explica que estos contratos, muy utilizados desde los años 2000, exigen una gran capacidad técnica de la Administración tanto para definir el proyecto como para supervisar su ejecución. El problema, según expone, es que el modelo tiende a priorizar la rentabilidad privada sobre la calidad asistencial. El texto recuerda que la Ley 15/1997, aprobada bajo el Gobierno de Aznar, permitió la gestión privada de servicios sanitarios públicos y que, desde entonces, se han repetido conflictos similares en otros hospitales como el de Alzira (Valencia).

En su mensaje, la artista preguntó directamente a España las razones de su postura, calificando la retirada como una decisión 'violenta e insultante'. Lamentó el creciente rechazo hacia Israel y recordó con afecto sus actuaciones en los países que también han decidido ausentarse —Irlanda, Países Bajos y Eslovenia—, donde, según ella, fue recibida con calidez. Dana defendió el carácter liberal de Israel, destacando el desfile del Orgullo de Tel Aviv como uno de los más grandes del mundo y recordando el valor simbólico y religioso de Jerusalén.

La mayoría de las víctimas eran migrantes indocumentados que vivían en condiciones infrahumanas: hacinados, sin ventilación, con escasos aseos y trabajando hasta 12 horas diarias. Además, la organización les cobraba abusivas comisiones por transporte, alojamiento y comida, llegando incluso a no pagarles salarios. La operación, denominada 'Franciskan-Everest', se llevó a cabo tras una investigación iniciada en 2024 en Villalgordo del Júcar (Albacete), con la colaboración de varias autoridades nacionales e internacionales, como la Fiscalía, la Inspección de Trabajo y la Embajada de Nepal. La red operaba en diversas fincas agrícolas de Albacete, Alicante, Castellón, Ciudad Real, Cuenca, Murcia, Valencia y Zaragoza.

Además, la ONU ha reafirmado su apoyo a la creación de un Estado palestino independiente, con una amplia mayoría de votos a favor de los Estados miembros. El representante palestino ante la ONU, Riad Mansur, agradeció el apoyo global en medio de la violencia israelí en Gaza y Cisjordania. La votación subraya el consenso internacional sobre la ilegalidad de las colonias israelíes y el apoyo a los derechos de los palestinos, aunque algunos países se han mostrado en desacuerdo o se han abstenido.

La jugadora de Santa Pola, que mide 1,93 metros, también fue cedida al Lointek Gernika, donde continuó brillando. Su fichaje por las Dallas Wings, equipo que ha obtenido el primer puesto en el sorteo de la WNBA, parece cada vez más probable, lo que marcaría un hito en su carrera y en la historia del baloncesto español. Awa, que también se dedicó al balonmano y al voleibol antes de decidirse por el baloncesto, ha sacrificado mucho para llegar hasta aquí, y su potencial parece ilimitado.

En el caso de Villarejo, se conoció que el excomisario tenía implicaciones en varias sociedades, lo que motivó su detención en 2017 y sus condenas posteriores por delitos relacionados con la revelación de secretos.

Los hospitales están saturados, los diagnósticos son imprecisos por la falta de reactivos y la escasez de medicamentos ha empujado a la población a automedicarse con remedios caseros. El Ministerio de Salud Pública registró casi 39.000 casos de chikungunya, mientras el dengue sigue activo en las 14 provincias del país. El gobierno cubano ha reconocido oficialmente 33 muertes, aunque fuentes médicas señalan que la cifra real podría ser mucho mayor, especialmente entre menores y ancianos. La precariedad del sistema de salud, la falta de recursos para fumigación y la acumulación de basura han favorecido la propagación de mosquitos.

En total, las inundaciones cobraron al menos 136 vidas, incluida la de 25 campistas y dos consejeros en Camp Mystic. A pesar de los esfuerzos heroicos de los rescatistas, muchos fueron sorprendidos por la rapidez y fuerza de las aguas, lo que llevó a un desbordamiento de llamadas de auxilio. Los despachadores, abrumados, trataban de consolar a los que llamaban, pero no siempre pudieron ofrecer respuestas satisfactorias.

Según la investigación, los días previos a la sentencia, Martínez Arrieta reconoció públicamente que era el ponente del fallo, sustituyendo así a Polo, quien había redactado una propuesta absolutoria. Ese gesto implicaba que la mayoría de la Sala se había decantado por la condena. El magistrado Berdugo, en una conferencia ante abogados, hizo alusiones a las deliberaciones aún en curso, lo que refuerza la idea de que la decisión estaba prácticamente tomada antes de la votación formal.

Revuelta, junto con Hazte Oír, llamó a manifestarse bajo el lema 'Todos a una contra la organización criminal', centrando su narrativa en la crítica al Ejecutivo socialista.

Pese a que Vox intentó distanciarse públicamente, los lazos entre ambos son evidentes. Figuras como Ignacio Garriga o Manuel Mariscal participaron en anteriores actos junto a la organización.

El sistema reproduce la estructura natural de las branquias de los peces: un embudo poroso que canaliza el flujo y evita atascos gracias a su autolimpieza. A diferencia de los filtros existentes, que suelen obstruirse o dejar pasar demasiadas partículas, este nuevo modelo mantiene una alta eficiencia con un mantenimiento mínimo.

Según las investigaciones de la Unitat Central de Persones Desaparegudes (UCPD) de los Mossos d’Esquadra, la víctima mantenía aún contacto con Sílvia, su ex, pese a que ella ya convivía con Josep, el otro arrestado. Las pesquisas apuntan a que el hombre podría haber sido el autor material del crimen, aunque no se descarta la implicación de la mujer en el encubrimiento.

El texto aborda los múltiples intentos frustrados de adaptar la novela 'Nothing Lasts Forever' de Roderick Thorp y las dificultades que tuvo el estudio para encontrar un actor protagonista. Tras el rechazo de grandes estrellas como Schwarzenegger, Stallone o Eastwood, el papel recayó en Bruce Willis, cuya elección fue inicialmente recibida con escepticismo por su asociación con la serie de comedia 'Luz de luna'. Sin embargo, la interpretación de Willis redefinió el concepto del héroe de acción al mostrar a un personaje más vulnerable, humano y alejado del arquetipo invencible. El artículo también menciona los problemas de producción y el caos industrial que caracterizaron el rodaje, aspectos que no impidieron que la película terminara siendo un fenómeno mundial. Casi cuatro décadas después, 'Jung]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jungla-de-cristal-como-bruce-willis-y-john-mctiernan-transformaron-un-proyecto-caotico-en-un-clasico-moderno-del-cine-de-accion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jungla-de-cristal-como-bruce-willis-y-john-mctiernan-transformaron-un-proyecto-caotico-en-un-clasico-moderno-del-cine-de-accion</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 22:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La UER impide las votaciones sobre la expulsión de Israel y España anuncia su retirada de Eurovisión 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante una asamblea celebrada en Ginebra, la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER) impidió en dos ocasiones que se votara sobre la participación de Israel en Eurovisión 2026. RTVE, apoyada por otros siete países —Países Bajos, Irlanda, Eslovenia, Islandia, Montenegro, Turquía y Argelia—, había solicitado una votación secreta para decidir si Israel debía competir en el certamen, así como una segunda propuesta para suspender temporalmente a la emisora israelí KAN durante un año. Ambas peticiones fueron rechazadas por la presidencia de la UER, que solo permitió votar una modificación de las normas del festival. Esta decisión implicó de facto la aceptación de Israel en la competición. Finalmente, las nuevas reglas fueron aprobadas con 738 votos a favor, 264 en contra y 120 abstenciones, lo que equivalió al 77 % del total requerido por los estatutos.

También ha pedido a los medios que publiquen las comunicaciones completas de los responsables del hospital para esclarecer los hechos.

El informe sostiene que la UCO solo examinó 10 de las más de 200 cuentas bancarias entregadas, lo que limita las conclusiones posibles sobre los movimientos financieros del entramado presuntamente favorecido por el exministro de Hacienda, Cristóbal Montoro, durante el Gobierno de Mariano Rajoy.

La perra fue encontrada con graves heridas, incluida una cortadura en el cuello probablemente realizada para quitarle el microchip. Además, su cuerpo estaba marcado por numerosos balinazos. Aunque al principio parecía un caso de abandono, la investigación ha revelado un nivel de crueldad que ha dejado a los responsables de la protectora horrorizados. Este tipo de actos son raros, ya que quitar el chip a un animal no es habitual. La perra, que está en recuperación, sufre tanto heridas físicas como psicológicas, y la sospecha recae sobre la posible conexión con un cazador debido a la raza de la perra y los balines.

Desde el colapso del régimen de Mohamed Siad Barre en 1991, Somalia ha sufrido guerras entre clanes, insurgencias islamistas y la creciente influencia de grupos como Al Shabab, vinculado a Al Qaeda. La intervención extranjera ha sido constante: Etiopía, Turquía, Emiratos Árabes y, sobre todo, Estados Unidos han ejecutado operaciones militares bajo el argumento de combatir el terrorismo.

Durante la administración de Donald Trump, la política hacia Somalia ha sido contradictoria. Por un lado, el expresidente llegó al poder prometiendo poner fin a las 'guerras interminables', pero al mismo tiempo aumentó los ataques con drones contra presuntos yihadistas. Estos bombardeos han causado numerosas víctimas civiles, incluidos niños, y han generado desconfianza hacia el gobierno federal somalí, considerado por parte ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-estados-unidos-en-somalia-y-las-consecuencias-de-sus-operaciones-militares</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-estados-unidos-en-somalia-y-las-consecuencias-de-sus-operaciones-militares</guid><pubDate>Sat, 06 Dec 2025 20:52:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El modelo Ribera: cómo comenzó la privatización sanitaria en España y por qué sigue vigente]]></title><description><![CDATA[El reciente escándalo surgido tras la filtración de un mensaje del CEO del grupo Ribera, Pablo Gallart, en el que sugería 'alargar las listas de espera para ganar más dinero', ha reabierto el debate sobre el modelo de privatización sanitaria impulsado por el Partido Popular. Dicho modelo, conocido como 'modelo Ribera', comenzó en la Comunitat Valenciana con la apertura del Hospital de Alzira en 1999, bajo el gobierno de Eduardo Zaplana. Fue el primer hospital público gestionado por una empresa privada, algo posible gracias a las concesiones sanitarias aprobadas durante el mandato de José María Aznar. Aunque Alzira fue presentado como un ejemplo de eficiencia, acumuló enormes pérdidas que acabaron con un rescate público de más de 70 millones de euros. Pese a estos problemas, el PP renovó la concesión aumentando considerablemente el coste por habitante, llegando a pagarse hasta 750 euros por persona.

La norma establece tres niveles de infraestructura —principal, intermedio y básico—, cada uno con distintos plazos de autonomía eléctrica: 24, 12 y 4 horas respectivamente. En el caso de las redes móviles, se exige que al menos el 85% de la población mantenga cobertura durante esas cuatro horas de interrupción del suministro.

Para cumplir con el decreto, los operadores deberán equipar los emplazamientos con baterías o generadores, aunque la instalación resulta más compleja en zonas urbanas debido a limitaciones estructurales y permisos vecinales. Según el Ministerio de Transformación Digital, el 30% de los 10.400 emplazamientos necesarios ya dispone de sistemas de reserva energética, por lo que alrededor de 7.280 deberán reforzarse.

El accidente desencadenó una de las crisis más recordadas de la Costa da Morte. El buque, construido en Alemania en 1969 como parte de la serie ‘German Liberty’, había cambiado varias veces de nombre y propiedad antes de ser gestionado por una compañía panameña al servicio de una agencia de Hong Kong. En su último viaje, transportaba sustancias inflamables, tóxicas y corrosivas con destino a Shanghái. 

Durante una tormenta, un contenedor en cubierta explotó al filtrarse agua, provocando un incendio incontrolable. La mayoría de la tripulación, presa del pánico, se lanzó al mar; solo ocho de los 31 tripulantes sobrevivieron.

En lugar de solicitar la aprobación para la venta libre en EE. UU., como se hizo en Europa, Bausch & Lomb optó por la vía de la prescripción médica, lo que permite establecer precios mucho más altos.

Nacido en Málaga en 1908, de origen humilde, Miguel destacó por su estilo innovador, amanerado y provocador, que rompió los moldes del género. Su interpretación de canciones como 'Ojos verdes', 'La bien pagá' o 'El día que nací yo' le convirtió en un artista admirado y también en un blanco para la represión del franquismo, que lo señaló 'por marica y por rojo'.

Este discurso ha generado tensiones en un país conocido por su cultura laboral extrema, que ha llevado a casos trágicos de 'karoshi', muertes por exceso de trabajo. Takaichi, quien también ha defendido su determinación de ser una líder eficaz, ha expresado su desprecio por la conciliación laboral y personal, lo que ha generado críticas de organizaciones que representan a los afectados por el 'karoshi'. A pesar de sus declaraciones, la líder aclaró que no buscaba promover el trabajo excesivo. Sin embargo, sus comentarios contradicen las medidas que Japón ha ido implementando en los últimos años para reducir las horas laborales y mejorar la salud mental, temas sensibles dada la creciente crisis de salud mental en el país.

Esta tecnología, difícil de interferir electrónicamente, ha transformado el campo de batalla en una red física y digital que dificulta los movimientos de las tropas y expone tanto al enemigo como a los propios soldados. Lo que empezó como una innovación para compensar la inferioridad numérica de Ucrania se ha convertido en una guerra industrializada en la que cada avance genera una contramedida inmediata. 

Rusia ha logrado una ventaja tangible gracias a su capacidad de producción y al apoyo tecnológico chino, que abastece sin límite su industria de fibra óptica. Su estrategia, liderada por la unidad de élite Rubikon, prioriza la destrucción de líneas logísticas y de operadores de drones por encima de los combates de infantería.

Desde la Ley General de Sanidad de 1986, que introdujo los primeros mecanismos de colaboración público-privada, hasta las reformas recientes bajo el gobierno de Pedro Sánchez, la sanidad pública española ha transitado de ser un servicio universal a un sistema parcialmente privatizado. Cada hito legislativo —como el Informe Abril de 1991, la Ley 15/1997 del gobierno de Aznar o la Ley 16/2003 impulsada por Zapatero— amplió las puertas a la gestión privada. Durante la crisis de 2008, el Real Decreto-Ley 16/2012 de Rajoy consolidó los copagos y recortes, justificándolos bajo el paraguas de la eficiencia.

Según datos recientes citados por la publicación financiera, sólo un 11 % de los trabajadores de grandes empresas en Estados Unidos declararon usar IA en octubre, una cifra incluso inferior al 12 % registrado dos semanas antes. Además, el porcentaje de pymes (empresas de 100–249 empleados) que informan no haber usado IA en las últimas dos semanas ha subido desde el 74,1 % de marzo hasta un alarmante 81,4 %. En compañías de más de 250 empleados, el “no uso” también ha aumentado, del 62,4 % en febrero al 68,6 % recientemente. Estos datos contrastan con las enormes previsiones de inversión —se estiman hasta 5 billones de dólares en infraestructura de IA hasta 2030— y sugieren que, por ahora, la IA sigue siendo más un experimento que una herramienta consolidada de productividad.

Tras apoyar las reformas en Guatemala y vivir de cerca la caída de Árbenz, se radicalizó políticamente. En México, conoció a Fidel y Raúl Castro y se unió al Movimiento 26 de Julio, participando en la expedición del 'Granma' y en la guerra que culminó con el derrocamiento de Batista en 1959.

El texto identifica cinco 'trucos' o estrategias: declarar un estado de emergencia europeo, considerar el rescate de Ucrania una cuestión existencial para la UE, hacer permanentes las sanciones a Rusia, obligar a instituciones financieras como Euroclear a entregar los fondos rusos, y aprobar las decisiones por mayoría cualificada para evitar vetos nacionales (por ejemplo, el de Hungría o Bélgica).

Bulleid, reconocido por sus diseños convencionales, decidió romper con la tradición al desarrollar la locomotora 'Leader', un modelo experimental que, pese a su apariencia moderna semejante a la de una diésel, funcionaba con vapor. Su diseño incluía dos cabinas de mando, motores con tres cilindros de vapor que movían cigüeñales y una transmisión por cadenas, algo inusual en locomotoras de la época. Sin embargo, el proyecto se vio frustrado por problemas prácticos: el fogonero trabajaba en condiciones extremas de calor, lo que provocó el rechazo sindical. Cuatro de las cinco máquinas construidas nunca se terminaron y todas acabaron desguazadas.

La entrega del cadáver en condiciones consideradas indignas generó una rápida reacción en redes sociales y entre organizaciones indígenas, exigiendo explicaciones y sanciones.

Sin embargo, el proyecto ha quedado envuelto en una intensa disputa institucional y política. La Corte de Cuentas ha rechazado el expediente por graves carencias documentales, aumento desmesurado del coste estimado —de 3.800 millones en 2005 a 13.500 millones actuales— y dudas sobre el cumplimiento de normas ambientales y de competencia. Salvini ha tratado de justificar el megaproyecto alegando su valor estratégico para la OTAN, pero expertos militares han señalado que el puente sería más un objetivo perfecto en caso de conflicto que un instrumento operativo útil, especialmente por su vulnerabilidad estructural. Además, la población local reclama mejoras previas en transporte y movilidad interna antes de afrontar una construcción tan monumental.

Según los informes, la multa ha sido emitida por incumplimientos relacionados con la protección de datos y la privacidad de los usuarios en Europa. Esta sanción refleja la creciente preocupación de las autoridades europeas sobre el manejo de la información personal por parte de grandes plataformas digitales, especialmente aquellas gestionadas fuera de la UE. Por su parte, representantes de Estados Unidos han expresado su descontento, considerando que la sanción podría tener implicaciones negativas para las empresas tecnológicas estadounidenses y podría afectar las relaciones transatlánticas.

Aquella generación, liderada por Vicente del Bosque, Casillas, Xavi e Iniesta, marcó un hito no solo deportivo, sino cultural y social, generando un sentimiento colectivo que permanece vivo en la memoria del país. En 2025, la Real Federación Española de Fútbol celebra este aniversario con exposiciones, proyecciones y homenajes, recordando aquel instante decisivo que simbolizó el trabajo en equipo, la disciplina y la excelencia futbolística. Hoy, la selección actual, dirigida por Luis de la Fuente, combina juventud, talento y dinamismo, con figuras como Rodri, Pedri, Nico Williams y Zubimendi, mientras Lamine Yamal representa la promesa del futuro.

Según su relato, el líder de Reform UK mostró un desprecio explícito hacia él por su color de piel cuando ambos coincidieron en el colegio a comienzos de los años ochenta. El autor recuerda cómo Farage, entonces un adolescente de 17 años, le dirigió comentarios despectivos como 'ese es el camino de vuelta a África' y gestos de burla cada vez que lo encontraba en el patio del colegio. Bankole narra que aquellos comportamientos le marcaron profundamente, provocándole una sensación de miedo e inferioridad que no ha logrado olvidar con el paso de las décadas. El artículo surge tras unas declaraciones recientes de Farage en las que negaba haber actuado con 'maldad' en sus años de escuela, minimizando los abusos e insistiendo en que era inconcebible que alguien recordara hechos tan lejanos.

Según los trabajadores, estas prácticas comprometían la seguridad y la calidad asistencial, generando un riesgo real para los pacientes que necesitaban atención urgente. Además, la dirección utilizó la Unidad de Corta Estancia para hacinar pacientes que debían ser ingresados en planta, con el objetivo de reducir costes y atraer pacientes de fuera del área, conocidos como no cápita, por los que el Gobierno regional paga un extra.

Destaca la figura de Amancio Ortega, fundador de Inditex, que concentra más de la mitad del total nacional con un patrimonio valorado en 124.000 millones. El crecimiento de estas fortunas, según UBS, se debe principalmente al buen desempeño empresarial y a la fuerte concentración de riqueza familiar. Además, el informe prevé que en los próximos quince años se traspasarán 162.000 millones de dólares en herencias, lo que plantea la necesidad de una gestión profesionalizada del relevo generacional.

La tasa de paro en agosto se situó en el 5,5 por ciento, más de un punto por encima de la media nacional, y se prevé que se mantenga en esa cifra hasta 2026, con una mejora moderada en 2027. El análisis identifica sectores especialmente afectados: construcción, comercio minorista, hostelería, fabricación y ocio.

En un comunicado, la organización aseguró que los toros de Osborne representan símbolos del españolismo y que «no hay lugar para ellos en Euskal Herria».

Según esta documentación, Pradas informó a Mazón a primera hora sobre la gravedad de la situación en Utiel, donde el río Magro se desbordó, causando las primeras víctimas mortales. A las 16:28 alertó del primer fallecido, pero Mazón, que se encontraba comiendo en El Ventorro, respondió dos horas y media después con un mensaje posponiendo su implicación directa. Pradas sostiene que actuó como mando único de la emergencia, mientras desde Presidencia se minimizaban los avisos y se le ordenó 'no molestar' al presidente.

Los mensajes muestran que Pradas informó en todo momento sobre la evolución de la DANA, incluyendo la aparición de víctimas y personas atrapadas en Utiel. Sin embargo, Cuenca insistió repetidamente en que no se debía confinar a la población, a pesar de que la ley sí lo permite, y condicionó la comunicación oficial del Es-Alert. Los mensajes también evidencian retrasos en la actuación de Mazón, quien permaneció horas en El Ventorro antes de acudir al Cecopi. Contradicciones importantes surgen frente a la declaración de Cuenca ante la jueza, donde afirmó no haber tenido conocimiento previo de la convocatoria del Cecopi ni haber participado en decisiones sobre el Es-Alert.

Sus declaraciones llegan un día después de la decisión de España de abandonar el festival y de dejar de emitir tanto la final prevista para mayo en Viena como las semifinales previas. Según López, la votación realizada en la Asamblea General de la UER en Ginebra no fue un debate libre ni democrático, sino un proceso pactado de antemano en despachos, lo que pone en cuestión la supuesta neutralidad política del certamen europeo. RTVE había aprobado en septiembre su retirada en caso de que Israel permaneciera en el concurso, una decisión que finalmente se ha materializado.

La demora media para operarse alcanza los 118 días y la de una primera consulta, 96. Esta situación, que afecta al bienestar físico y mental de los pacientes, evidencia el deterioro progresivo de la sanidad pública. Las especialidades más saturadas son la cirugía plástica, la neurocirugía y la angiología, mientras que cardiología o ginecología presentan tiempos algo menores.

El primer ataque, ocurrido el 2 de septiembre, fue presentado como una operación contra 'narcoterroristas', pero la falta de pruebas y la posibilidad de que entre las víctimas hubiera pescadores ha levantado fuertes sospechas. El secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth, ha sido señalado por ordenar la muerte de dos supervivientes tras la ofensiva, lo que podría constituir un crimen de guerra según senadores demócratas y expertos en derecho internacional.

El estudio analizó 104 investigaciones realizadas entre 2016 y 2024, con datos de participantes de todos los continentes. En 92 de estos trabajos se identificaron asociaciones claras entre una dieta rica en productos ultraprocesados y una mayor probabilidad de desarrollar o morir por patologías como cáncer, enfermedades cardiovasculares, respiratorias, renales, metabólicas y mentales.

Según documentos aportados por la exconsellera de Interior y Justicia, Salomé Pradas, a las 16:28 del día del temporal comunicó a Cuenca que se había registrado un fallecimiento en Utiel. Sin embargo, la alerta pública no se activó hasta alrededor de las 20:00, lo que plantea dudas sobre la gestión de los tiempos de respuesta ante la emergencia. Durante ese lapso, el president Mazón se encontraba en una comida con la periodista Maribel Vilaplana en un restaurante del centro de València, un encuentro que se prolongó hasta pasadas las 19:00 horas.

Nieto del dramaturgo Pedro Muñoz Seca, Ussía se consolidó durante más de medio siglo como referente del columnismo satírico y de opinión, destacando especialmente por su defensa de la Monarquía constitucional y su contundencia contra el terrorismo etarra, una etapa que lo obligó incluso a vivir con escolta. Formó parte esencial de la historia de ABC, donde publicó 2.459 textos y mantuvo durante casi dos décadas la columna «Cosas que pasan». Su humor corrosivo, su estilo directo y su mirada crítica definieron una trayectoria que también atravesó otros medios como Diario 16, La Razón o El Debate, en el que escribía a diario hasta el final de su vida.

Durante la reunión, varios países, entre ellos España, pidieron que se realizara una votación secreta para excluir a Israel del certamen debido a su situación política y las controversias que rodean su participación. Sin embargo, la propuesta fue rechazada y, finalmente, los estatutos de la nueva edición fueron aprobados con una amplia mayoría de 738 votos a favor, 264 en contra y 120 abstenciones. RTVE explicó su retirada alegando desconfianza hacia la organización del festival y señalando que existen presiones políticas en torno al evento. La respuesta de Israel no se hizo esperar.

Según su análisis, la sanidad privada, al funcionar con lógica de mercado, prioriza la rentabilidad por encima del bienestar social, lo que genera exclusión de las personas con menos recursos, reducción en la atención preventiva y mayor mortalidad evitable. Los seguros médicos, que se presentan como alternativa, se rigen por criterios de beneficio económico y tienden a excluir a quienes presentan mayor riesgo sanitario. El artículo cita investigaciones de universidades como Harvard y datos de la OCDE que vinculan directamente la gestión privada hospitalaria con tasas más altas de muertes evitables, infecciones y desigualdad en el acceso.

En el primero, Ayuso protagoniza un falso anuncio de teletienda llamado 'La ETA en casa', una parodia de 'La tienda en casa', donde promociona un muñeco que representa a un etarra. En tono humorístico, la dirigente ofrece el producto como una herramienta para quienes quieren 'echar a Pedro Sánchez', afirmando que con ese muñeco 'nunca te quedarás sin argumentos'. El sketch incluye también a José Luis Martínez-Almeida, que en la parodia asegura que el PP lleva años utilizando ese “espantajo” sin fallarles nunca.

En Broadway, casi ninguna producción reciente ha recuperado su inversión, y los elevados costes de producción tras la pandemia, junto con la reducción del turismo y el menor gasto del público, han hecho que incluso obras con grandes nombres enfrenten enormes pérdidas. Mientras los musicales se hunden económicamente, las obras de teatro sin música prosperan gracias a presupuestos más modestos y al interés de actores de renombre en participar por prestigio. En paralelo, Hollywood registra su mayor crisis de empleo y producción en décadas: desde 2022, el número de trabajadores en la industria del cine en Los Ángeles ha caído un 30 %. A los efectos de las huelgas de guionistas y actores se añaden problemas estructurales, como la competencia feroz del streaming, TikTok o los videojue]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-economico-y-creativo-del-cine-y-el-teatro-musical-en-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-declive-economico-y-creativo-del-cine-y-el-teatro-musical-en-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 15:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brasil reduce la pobreza a mínimos históricos gracias al empleo y las ayudas sociales]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Instituto Brasileño de Geografía y Estadística (IBGE) informó que la pobreza en Brasil descendió en 2024 por tercer año consecutivo, situándose en el 23,1% y alcanzando su nivel más bajo desde 2012. La pobreza extrema también se redujo al 3,5%. Esta mejora se atribuye principalmente a la recuperación del mercado laboral y al mantenimiento de programas sociales como Bolsa Familia y Auxílio Brasil. En términos absolutos, el número de personas consideradas pobres disminuyó en 8,6 millones respecto al año anterior, mientras que quienes viven en extrema pobreza pasaron de 9,3 millones a 7,4 millones.

El estudio subraya, sin embargo, que persisten marcadas desigualdades regionales y raciales.

De los 2.424.961 parados registrados, 1.404.139 pertenecen a este grupo de edad, lo que equivale al 58% del total. A pesar de que se ha producido un leve aumento de 4.822 contrataciones entre los mayores de 45 años, la cifra sigue reflejando un fuerte problema de edadismo en el mercado laboral español. El sector servicios concentra la mayor cantidad de desempleo en este grupo, con más de un millón de personas afectadas, seguido por la industria y la construcción.

También trabaja en proyectos personales o familiares con presupuestos más modestos, alrededor de 2.500 euros, cuando no hay intención comercial. 

Durante la entrevista, Corriàs ha descrito el proceso creativo como un trabajo que va mucho más allá de escribir.

Según el documento, la dirección del hospital prioriza la rentabilidad económica por encima de la atención sanitaria, lo que se traduce en la selección de pacientes basándose en su rentabilidad. Además, los médicos son presionados para atender a pacientes externos, procedentes de otras áreas sanitarias, ofreciendo incentivos económicos a quienes aceptan hacer horas extras.

Según explica, cerca del 44% de las instalaciones de autoconsumo están obligadas a operar sin verter a la red la energía sobrante, lo que reduce notablemente su rentabilidad y dificulta la expansión del sector, especialmente en entornos industriales donde la red suele tener capacidad suficiente para absorber excedentes. Gimeno considera que esta restricción es un freno evidente a la transición energética y sitúa a España por detrás de otros países europeos, donde la generación distribuida tiene mayor peso. Además, el directivo destaca la importancia creciente del almacenamiento energético. A su juicio, las baterías ya no son un complemento opcional, sino un elemento estructural necesario en sistemas eléctricos con alta penetración renovable.

Durante una de las intervenciones, la patrullera Punta da Guía retiró 148 cacharros y liberó unos 14 kilos de pulpo, que no alcanzaban las tallas reglamentarias. En un segundo operativo, la patrullera Mar de Galicia incautó 650 cacharros adicionales y liberó otros 16 kilos de cefalópodos. Estos resultados se suman a los 720 cacharros retirados la semana anterior en la misma zona, lo que revela una actividad furtiva muy activa en el litoral del sur de Pontevedra. Las autoridades intensifican la vigilancia para evitar prácticas que ponen en riesgo la sostenibilidad de los recursos marinos y el sustento de los pescadores legales.

En aquel entonces, el menor y su hermano, que ya era mayor de edad, agredieron sexualmente a su exnovia de 15 años. Aunque el menor era inimputable penalmente, la justicia demostró que ambos actuaron de forma conjunta. El hermano fue condenado por la Audiencia Provincial a 13 años y medio de prisión y a siete años de libertad vigilada, además de la prohibición de acercarse a la víctima durante dieciséis años.

El nuevo caso tuvo lugar en un descampado cercano a una sala de fiestas de Málaga, donde la víctima, de 18 años, fue supuestamente agredida por tres jóvenes de forma reiterada. La investigación policial permitió identificar a los sospechosos gracias a las cámaras de seguridad del local. Los tres fueron enviados a prisión provisional sin fianza.

Estos trabajadores, entre los que se destacan Sarah Mardini y Seán Binder, fueron detenidos en 2018 por ayudar a migrantes que llegaban a las costas griegas. La acusación se basa en que facilitaban la entrada ilegal de personas al país, algo que podría acarrear penas de hasta 25 años de prisión. Organizaciones internacionales, como Amnistía Internacional y Human Rights Watch, han condenado estos cargos y los han calificado como una forma de criminalizar la solidaridad. Este caso se considera uno de los más significativos en Europa en cuanto a la persecución de trabajadores humanitarios.

Según la denuncia, estas palabras implicarían una “revelación explícita de información reservada”, ya que fueron pronunciadas antes de que se conociera oficialmente la sentencia. El político considera que la actuación de los jueces que dictaron el fallo es más grave que la supuesta revelación cometida por García Ortiz, que renunció tras la condena.

La empleada asegura que existen vacantes en tiendas cercanas a su nuevo domicilio, mientras la empresa sostiene que no hay plazas disponibles.

Esta situación le ha provocado un cuadro de estrés y ansiedad que la mantiene de baja médica, y denuncia un clima laboral cada vez más duro en la compañía, donde siente que las cargas de trabajo han aumentado y se penaliza a quienes reclaman mejores condiciones o conciliación.

El informe fue encargado por 13.000 euros, evitando superar el umbral para una licitación abierta. Este informe fue solicitado antes de la llegada de Isabel Díaz Ayuso al poder, durante la presidencia de Ángel Garrido, y se realizó en un contexto de cambio de accionistas en las concesionarias que gestionan el hospital.

La autora denuncia que la política de las derechas, especialmente en la Comunidad de Madrid bajo el Gobierno de Isabel Díaz Ayuso, está orientada a favorecer intereses económicos privados a costa del presupuesto público. Menciona el caso de la sanidad madrileña, donde empresas como Ribera Salud y el grupo Quirón han recibido pagos muy superiores a lo presupuestado, alcanzando casi 5.000 millones de euros entre 2021 y 2024. Este proceso se inscribe en una tendencia más amplia: la transferencia de recursos públicos al sector privado mediante contratos, colaboraciones público-privadas y recortes en los servicios esenciales.

Paralelamente, Vox logra superar al Partido Popular, convirtiéndose en la principal fuerza estatal de derechas en el Parlament.

Según la organización, los tomates se venden bajo la marca “Campos de Granada”, nombre de una empresa española que produce también en Marruecos. En los envases, el nombre de la marca aparece de forma destacada mientras que el origen real del producto —Marruecos— queda en un segundo plano, algo que podría confundir al consumidor y afectar a la venta de tomates nacionales. 

Miguel Monferrer, secretario provincial de COAG Granada, ha señalado que esta práctica constituye un ejemplo de deslocalización productiva y de competencia desleal hacia los agricultores locales. En plena temporada de tomate cherry en España, asegura que hay suficiente producción nacional en cantidad, calidad y precio, por lo que considera injustificable recurrir a importaciones de países terceros.

A través de un tono poético y reflexivo, el texto repasa la singularidad de su voz: baja, firme y profundamente humana. Labordeta no buscaba convencer, sino recordar, y su música —lejos del estruendo o la grandilocuencia— encarnaba una forma de resistencia serena y llena de dignidad. Canciones como “Somos”, “Aragón”, “Albada” o “Canto a la libertad” trascienden lo meramente musical para convertirse en actos de memoria colectiva, en homenajes a la tierra y sus gentes. El autor valora cómo su obra combinaba ternura y compromiso social, mostrando que la dignidad también se canta y que la esperanza se puede decir en voz baja. En la parte final, Moreno recuerda un viaje con su padre a los campos de Aragón, evocando tiempos de siegas duras y vidas humildes, y estableciendo un paralelismo entre esas generaciones de trabajadores y el propio Labordet]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jose-antonio-labordeta-la-voz-humilde-que-dio-sentido-a-una-tierra</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jose-antonio-labordeta-la-voz-humilde-que-dio-sentido-a-una-tierra</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 06:08:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mariló Montero explica una anécdota en Namibia que terminó en una boda simbólica]]></title><description><![CDATA[Durante una actuación de su amiga y también participante de MasterChef, Valeria Ross, Mariló Montero compartió una anécdota poco conocida de su vida: afirmó que está simbólicamente casada con un hombre africano al que conoció en un viaje a Namibia en 2018. Según relató, durante un safari, decidió bajarse del vehículo para explorar la sabana y fue acompañada por el chófer del tour, quien le mostró la flora local y trenzó una pulsera con ramas verdes. Años después supo que este gesto formaba parte de una ceremonia tradicional de matrimonio. Montero explicó que nunca formalizó ese vínculo ni lo registró legalmente, pero tampoco llegó a divorciarse. Contó la historia con humor y nostalgia, describiendo aquel encuentro como un momento mágico lleno de curiosidad y espontaneidad.

Según la transcripción de una teleconferencia mantenida el 1 de diciembre entre varios líderes europeos, Macron advirtió que existe la posibilidad de que Washington termine «traicionando» a Ucrania y a Europa en relación con las exigencias territoriales rusas, sin garantías claras de seguridad. Merz, por su parte, recomendó a Zelenski actuar con extrema cautela, sugiriendo que los negociadores estadounidenses, Steve Witkoff y Jared Kushner —este último, yerno de Donald Trump—, podrían estar actuando con dobles intenciones.

En el último año se ha ordenado la suspensión de 40 compañías, la mayoría sin clientes ni operaciones reales, aunque también se incluyen casos de entidades que no han comprado energía suficiente para garantizar el suministro o no han cumplido con sus obligaciones económicas. España es el país europeo con mayor número de comercializadoras debido a la ausencia de licencia administrativa previa y a la baja barrera de entrada al mercado, lo que ha permitido la proliferación de operadores sin actividad real.

La decisión conjunta responde al desacuerdo con la Unión Europea de Radiodifusión (UER) por mantener la participación de Israel pese a la situación humanitaria en Gaza y las denuncias por violaciones de derechos humanos. RTVE fue la primera en comunicar su salida, criticando que la UER se negara a una votación secreta sobre la presencia de Israel y denunciando presiones políticas dentro de la organización. Será la primera vez desde 1961 que España quede fuera del concurso, rompiendo una trayectoria ininterrumpida de 65 años de participación.

Estas subvenciones, que sumaron 1,8 millones de euros, estaban destinadas a financiar actividades extraescolares exclusivamente en colegios concertados, bajo el argumento de apoyar a familias con menos recursos. Sin embargo, la Sala de lo Contencioso Administrativo ha concluido que la medida generaba una doble discriminación: por un lado, frente a los alumnos de la escuela pública con más medios, y por otro, frente a los de la concertada con menos recursos. En su sentencia, el tribunal desmonta la justificación municipal de que los centros concertados soportan más gastos de mantenimiento, ya que las ayudas también podían cubrir actividades externas, sin relación con dichos costes.

Esta acción judicial, conocida como 'Ashby v. Schertz-Cibolo-Universal ISD', busca una medida cautelar general que afecte a los más de mil distritos escolares del estado, tras comprobarse que algunos de ellos han comenzado a exhibir los carteles pese a órdenes judiciales previas. El origen del conflicto está en la Ley SB 10, aprobada por el legislativo de Texas y defendida con fervor por el fiscal general Ken Paxton, que obliga a las escuelas a aceptar y mostrar copias de los Diez Mandamientos en versión de la Biblia del Rey Jacobo.

Aunque el informe confirma que se vulneraron los protocolos de manejo de información sensible, Hegseth posee autoridad para desclasificar datos de inteligencia, por lo que no se determinó si los procedimientos de desclasificación se aplicaron correctamente.

Oltra impulsó la desprivatización de varios hospitales en la Comunitat Valenciana, decisión que habría ocasionado pérdidas millonarias a Ribera Salud. Tras ello, el grupo habría contribuido a un proceso judicial sin pruebas sólidas, en connivencia con figuras de la extrema derecha como Cristina Seguí y dirigentes del Partido Popular valenciano, entre ellos Francisco Camps.

Este hallazgo se basa en la combinación de los datos de las dos últimas campañas del detector ATLAS del Gran Colisionador de Hadrones (LHC), mostrando una significancia de 3,4 desviaciones estándar por encima del fondo, lo que supera los 3,0 observados previamente por el detector CMS. Este resultado es crucial para entender el mecanismo de Higgs, que explica cómo las partículas adquieren masa mediante su interacción con el campo de Higgs. Hasta ahora, solo se habían observado interacciones firmes con fermiones de tercera generación, como quarks top y bottom o leptones tau. Detectar esta desintegración en muones permite confirmar que el mecanismo de Higgs también se aplica a partículas más ligeras de segunda generación.

El presidente ruso destacó que, mientras Washington sigue comprando uranio a Rusia —clave para alimentar sus plantas nucleares—, presiona a India para que reduzca su importación de petróleo ruso. Según datos oficiales, Rusia suministra alrededor del 25% del uranio enriquecido que adquiere EE. UU., lo que supone ingresos de unos 1.200 millones de dólares en 2025. En cambio, desde el inicio de la guerra en Ucrania, las importaciones indianas de crudo ruso han pasado del 2% al 35% de su total, pese a las presiones y sanciones occidentales.

Putin defendió el derecho de Nueva Delhi a comerciar libremente con Moscú si Washington mantiene su propio flujo energético con Rusia. Afirmó que la cooperación energética entre Rusia e India se mantiene estable y ajena a las sanciones o vaivenes políticos.

A través del caso de Fernanda Soledad Yramain, asesinada por su expareja tras múltiples denuncias ignoradas, el artículo muestra cómo la desprotección institucional agrava una crisis de derechos de las mujeres. Desde diciembre de 2023, el gobierno de Milei ha eliminado el Ministerio de las Mujeres y la Subsecretaría de Protección contra la Violencia de Género, además de recortar drásticamente los programas de apoyo económico y psicológico, como el plan Acompañar y la línea de emergencias 144, que perdió casi la mitad de su personal en apenas unos meses.

Aunque el avance ruso es limitado para un país del tamaño de Ucrania, refleja un progreso notable respecto a periodos anteriores. La presencia masiva de drones ralentiza el avance mecanizado, pero hace que las zonas conquistadas sean más resistentes a contraataques. En el frente ucraniano se detecta un declive operativo, aunque algunos comandantes amenazan con desobedecer órdenes políticas, lo que refleja tensiones internas más que una resistencia real. La decisión final sobre continuar la guerra o aceptar una derrota recae en los responsables políticos ucranianos.

La investigación, que analizó 65 productos convencionales de 16 países, halló presencia de TFA en más del 80% de las muestras, especialmente en cereales de desayuno, panes integrales y refinados, pasta y bollería. Este compuesto se forma cuando pesticidas que contienen sustancias perfluoroalquiladas (Pfas) se descomponen en el suelo y son absorbidos por las plantas. Las concentraciones encontradas en los alimentos fueron, de media, cien veces superiores a las detectadas en el agua del grifo.

Los Pfas, utilizados desde los años cincuenta en la industria y en productos de consumo, se denominan 'químicos eternos' porque tardan siglos en degradarse y pueden permanecer en suelos y aguas durante generaciones.

La Guardia Civil detuvo a la madre del menor y a su pareja sentimental, que no es el padre biológico del niño. Según fuentes de la investigación, el hombre tenía antecedentes por presuntos malos tratos al pequeño y una orden de alejamiento de la madre, quien también se encuentra arrestada. El hallazgo se produjo cerca de las 23:30 horas, tras una intensa búsqueda iniciada por la alerta de desaparición del menor, difundida por redes sociales. Vecinos y voluntarios colaboraron en la localización mientras las autoridades desplegaban un operativo con Guardia Civil, Policía Local y Protección Civil.

Analizando datos de 42 estudios previos y más de 2.100 participantes, los investigadores demostraron que las diferencias observadas entre estudios anteriores no reflejaban variaciones reales en el funcionamiento del cerebro, sino limitaciones metodológicas y de tamaño de muestra. Al combinar toda esa información, lograron identificar un patrón cerebral común que implica zonas como la ínsula, la corteza prefrontal dorsolateral, el cíngulo anterior dorsal, regiones premotoras y el cerebelo, junto a estructuras profundas como el tálamo o el caudado. Este mapa muestra tanto activaciones como desactivaciones, indicando un complejo equilibrio entre recursos neuronales durante el aprendizaje del miedo.

El número de satélites en órbita ha crecido exponencialmente, pasando de 2.000 en 2019 a más de 15.000, con previsiones que apuntan a 560.000 en los próximos años. Esta proliferación, impulsada por la reducción de costes de lanzamiento y la falta de regulación internacional, amenaza tanto la astronomía terrestre como la espacial.

El equipo de Alejandro Borlaff, investigador de la NASA, ha simulado los efectos de la luz reflejada en telescopios como el Hubble, SPHEREx, el futuro ARRAKIHS de la ESA y el planificado Xuntian chino. Los resultados muestran una contaminación lumínica significativa que podría inutilizar un alto porcentaje de las imágenes obtenidas. Entre las posibles soluciones, se plantea ubicar los satélites en órbitas más bajas, aunque esto supon]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-satelites-de-megaconstelaciones-amenazan-las-observaciones-cientificas-desde-el-espacio</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/los-satelites-de-megaconstelaciones-amenazan-las-observaciones-cientificas-desde-el-espacio</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La riqueza de los multimillonarios españoles crece un 21% en 2025, con Amancio Ortega a la cabeza]]></title><description><![CDATA[En 2025, las grandes fortunas españolas vieron aumentar su riqueza un 21,5%, alcanzando los 213.100 millones de dólares (182.602 millones de euros), según el informe 'Billionaire Ambitions 2025' de UBS. Ocho personas se incorporaron al grupo de ultrarricos, que ya suma 32 en España. Destaca el crecimiento patrimonial de Amancio Ortega, cuyo capital ascendió hasta los 124.000 millones de dólares, lo que representa el 58,2% de la riqueza total de los multimillonarios del país. El informe subraya también que en los próximos 15 años se prevén más de 162.000 millones de dólares en transferencias de patrimonio intergeneracionales, un reto para la planificación familiar, la gobernanza y la sostenibilidad del legado económico. A nivel mundial, la riqueza total de los ultrarricos alcanzó un récord de 15,8 billones de dólares, impulsada por nuevas empresas y una gran ola de herencias.

Con esta decisión, la Audiencia corrige al juez Juan Carlos Peinado, que mantenía abierta la investigación dentro del llamado 'caso Begoña Gómez'. El tribunal subraya que Peinado no debió admitir a trámite la querella presentada por Vox, al no existir pruebas de que Martín Aguirre tuviera funciones de control sobre las actividades de la asesora ni conocimiento de irregularidades.

Este mecanismo permite transmitir alertas e incidencias de tráfico directamente a los navegadores y sistemas multimedia de los vehículos mediante ondas de radio FM y sin coste adicional. A diferencia de las balizas conectadas, que cuestan entre 40 y 50 euros y necesitan conexión a internet, el TMC utiliza el canal de datos del sistema RDS, enviando mensajes codificados de 104 bits cada cinco minutos. Su diseño garantiza fiabilidad mediante duplicación de mensajes y permite a los coches mostrar avisos visuales y sonoros, además de recalcular rutas en tiempo real para evitar atascos o accidentes.

Miembro de Booker T. & the MG’s, fue coautor de clásicos como 'Sittin’ on the Dock of the Bay' junto a Otis Redding o 'In the Midnight Hour' con Wilson Pickett. Su estilo elegante y sobrio, caracterizado por un dominio natural del ritmo y una afinada sensibilidad melódica, marcó el sonido del soul de los años sesenta. Además de ser pieza central de Stax, Cropper trabajó con artistas como Sam & Dave, Rufus y Carla Thomas o Eddie Floyd, con quien coescribió 'Knock on Wood'.

El hecho, ocurrido el pasado 2 de septiembre de 2025, se produjo tras un primer bombardeo en el que dos personas habrían sobrevivido. Según informaciones de medios estadounidenses, dichas personas fueron ejecutadas en la segunda ofensiva, lo que ha levantado fuertes críticas de expertos y defensores de derechos humanos que califican las muertes como ejecuciones extrajudiciales. La secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, defendió la actuación del almirante, asegurando que actuó dentro de la ley y bajo la autoridad del secretario de Defensa, Pete Hegseth, quien aprobó la operación.

Suárez confirmó que ya a las 17.10 se había planteado la posibilidad de enviar un mensaje de alerta a los móviles, aunque no se mencionó explícitamente el Es-Alert. La Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar (CHJ) había advertido sobre el riesgo de desbordamiento y posible rotura de la presa de Forata, que podía provocar un aumento del agua de 6 a 7 metros en algunas localidades. 

El retraso en el envío del mensaje hasta las 20.11 se debió a la tensión en el Cecopi, la necesidad de coordinarse con los alcaldes, dudas sobre la redacción de los textos en castellano y valenciano, y recomendaciones de los bomberos sobre evitar alarmismo.

Basándose en el libro de Lisa Herzog, 'The Democratic Marketplace: How a More Equal Economy Can Save Our Political Ideals', se expone que los trabajadores estadounidenses enfrentan largas jornadas laborales, escaso control sobre sus condiciones de trabajo y una creciente desigualdad en ingresos y riqueza. Esta situación no solo limita su libertad y bienestar, sino que también erosiona los principios democráticos al favorecer a los grandes empresarios y oligopolios que traducen su poder económico en influencia política. Herzog critica la idea meritocrática, mostrando que el éxito económico no siempre refleja virtud ni esfuerzo personal, sino privilegio y herencia, mientras que los trabajadores perciben injustamente sus dificultades como fracasos individuales.

Además, Karp ha mostrado un fuerte apoyo a políticas migratorias restrictivas, ofreciendo sus servicios a ICE para la vigilancia y deportación de inmigrantes, incluida la construcción de la plataforma ImmigrationOS.

Ricart ideó, en 1819, un método propio basado en planchas de latón con caracteres perceptibles al tacto, anticipando así los sistemas que más tarde darían lugar al Braille. Su iniciativa, presentada al Ayuntamiento de Barcelona en 1820, proponía crear una escuela gratuita y universal para invidentes. Sin embargo, su proyecto fue desatendido por las autoridades, aunque recibió apoyo moral y la valoración positiva de una comisión municipal. Paralelamente, el sacerdote Manuel Catalá fundó la llamada Academia Cívica y Gratuita, adoptando y modificando parcialmente el método de Ricart, lo que originó un conflicto entre ambos por la autoría y reconocimiento del sistema de enseñanza.

A su juicio, Europa atraviesa una etapa de desorientación marcada por el auge del nacionalismo y la pérdida de la idea de unidad. Margallo subrayó que recuperar los valores fundacionales de la civilización cristiana —como la solidaridad, la justicia, la moderación y el respeto al Estado de Derecho— es esencial para fortalecer el proyecto europeo.

Sin embargo, el Ministerio para la Transición Ecológica confía en que la mayor generación renovable y el incremento de la demanda eléctrica compensen ese aumento, reduciendo el coste final para los consumidores. Según las estimaciones oficiales, el descenso de la factura podría oscilar entre un 4% y un 10%, dependiendo del tipo de cliente: una reducción del 4,66% para los hogares acogidos a la tarifa regulada (PVPC), del 4,95% para las pymes, del 8,55% para la industria y del 9,91% para los consumidores electrointensivos. Estas previsiones se basan en un precio futuro del MWh de 56,7 euros, inferior al promedio de 2025, que fue de 64,96 euros.

Este tipo de contrataciones, aunque legales, deberían usarse solo de forma excepcional, ya que evitan los procesos competitivos de licitación pública y pueden generar sobrecostes significativos.

Con ingredientes sencillos como patatas, pimientos, cebolla y ajo, este plato es una opción perfecta tanto como plato principal o guarnición. Su origen se encuentra en el sureste de España, donde pastores y campesinos solían prepararlo con lo que tenían a mano. La receta destaca por su versatilidad y su capacidad para adaptarse a diferentes acompañamientos, como carne o huevos fritos. Para prepararlas, basta con freír las patatas junto a las verduras en aceite de oliva, lo que les aporta un sabor único. El truco de añadir un toque de vinagre a los ajos machacados le da un sabor extra que hace que el plato sea aún más sabroso. Las patatas deben ser de buena calidad para soportar bien la fritura y es recomendable no usar patatas congeladas.

Según el estudio citado, el 96% de las imágenes obtenidas por algunos telescopios espaciales se verán contaminadas en la próxima década por el reflejo de los satélites y la basura espacial que generan. El incremento de lanzamientos ha disparado la cifra de satélites desde los 2.000 de 2019 a casi 15.000 en la actualidad, con previsiones que apuntan a más de 100.000 antes de 2030. La comunidad científica alerta de que la situación se asemeja a un experimento de geoingeniería sin control, en el que la interferencia lumínica es solo uno de los síntomas. Además del daño directo a la astronomía, se advierte del riesgo de choques en cadena conocido como Síndrome de Kessler, el deterioro del cielo nocturno como patrimonio común y el impacto de los lanzamientos y desintegraciones en la capa de ozono.

Ribera Salud, que facturó cerca de 800 millones de euros, es responsable de la gestión del Hospital de Torrejón, donde su consejero delegado, Pablo Gallart, instó a los directivos a reducir intervenciones y rechazar casos menos rentables, lo que implicaría un aumento calculado de las listas de espera con el fin de alcanzar un mayor beneficio financiero.

Hasta ahora, los hombres son los únicos obligados a realizar el servicio, mientras que las mujeres podían participar de forma voluntaria. Sin embargo, una iniciativa propuesta buscaba cambiar esta normativa, sugiriendo que todas las personas, independientemente de su género, deberían cumplir con un servicio nacional, ya sea militar o en tareas de protección civil, medioambientales o sociales. La propuesta fue rechazada rotundamente en un referéndum celebrado el 30 de noviembre de 2025, con más del 84 % de los votantes en contra.

Los hechos ocurrieron el 29 de julio de 2025, cuando Vallejo amenazó públicamente a Arroyo con deportarla a Perú y retirarle su DNI español, en respuesta a un vídeo en el que la periodista mostraba un pin con la bandera de Perú con motivo del 204 aniversario de la independencia del país sudamericano. El mensaje de Vallejo tuvo más de 600.000 visualizaciones y provocó acoso racista hacia Arroyo por parte de sectores vinculados a la ultraderecha.

Aunque la medida parecía efectiva al principio, pronto se demostró que su diseño era un desastre. Los cazadores, en lugar de matar a las ratas, simplemente les cortaban las colas y las liberaban, lo que llevó a un aumento en la población de roedores. Esta práctica fomentó la cría y el tráfico de ratas y colas, exacerbando el problema de salud en lugar de solucionarlo. La caza de ratas se convirtió en un ejemplo de cómo las políticas mal diseñadas pueden tener consecuencias imprevistas, al no comprender la complejidad de los comportamientos humanos y los ecosistemas urbanos. A pesar del fracaso de la caza, la peste continuó afectando a Hanoi, mostrando que las intervenciones mal enfocadas pueden empeorar la situación.

Redondo calificó la medida de 'devastadora', señalando que envía un mensaje negativo a los operadores de justicia y socava la lucha contra el narcotráfico. Según Redondo, la decisión es contradictoria, ya que mientras EE.UU. implementa políticas para combatir las drogas y el crimen organizado, al mismo tiempo se perdona a alguien que utilizó su poder para proteger el narcotráfico. Hernández, extraditado durante el mandato de la actual presidenta Xiomara Castro, fue liberado después de recibir el perdón de Trump, quien alegó que el gobierno de Joe Biden había tendido una trampa al exmandatario.

En contraste, Malta ha adoptado un marco más flexible y competitivo, atrayendo a operadores internacionales por la claridad y adaptabilidad de sus normas.

Este enorme dirigible de helio, diseñado para transportar aviones ligeros de reconocimiento llamados Sparrowhawk, representaba un innovador intento de ampliar la capacidad militar desde el aire. A pesar de su compleja estructura de duraluminio, motores internos y sistemas de seguridad, el Akron sufrió varios incidentes menores durante su servicio, que culminaron con su caída en una tormenta frente a la costa de Nueva Jersey, provocando la muerte de 73 personas. Además, un dirigible de rescate enviado también se estrelló, sumando dos víctimas más. El proyecto de portaaviones aéreos se abandonó posteriormente debido a la vulnerabilidad de estas aeronaves y al incendio del Hindenburg, que minó la confianza en los dirigibles.

Los correos electrónicos intervenidos y los informes aportados por los Mossos d’Esquadra y la Agencia Tributaria sugieren la existencia de pagos realizados por compañías gasísticas a Equipo Económico, considerado el núcleo de la trama, antes de recibir favores administrativos.

Los agentes, que iban de paisano, le impidieron continuar con la actividad y la obligaron a regresar a su domicilio, lo que provocó un ataque de ansiedad que requirió atención hospitalaria. La tutora legal de Carmen, su hermana María, presentó una denuncia ante la Policía Nacional y una queja ante el Ayuntamiento, acompañada del parte médico. En la denuncia se describe un trato agresivo y desproporcionado por parte de los agentes, que incluso permanecieron frente a la vivienda para impedir que Carmen volviera a salir. La abogada de la afectada subraya que, aunque alimentar a las palomas pueda suponer una infracción administrativa, no justifica un trato intimidatorio hacia una persona vulnerable.

Los hechos ocurrieron en febrero, cuando los progenitores viajaron con su hija menor y la dejaron sola en un autobús interurbano desde Granada hasta Bilbao. En Bilbao vive su hermano mayor, quien también habría sido abandonado de manera similar años atrás. Al llegar, la menor quedó sola y acudió a los Servicios Sociales, que activaron los protocolos de protección, derivándola primero a un hogar de acogida y luego a un centro tutelado por la autoridad competente. A finales de noviembre, la Unidad de Acogimiento Residencial alertó a la Policía de que los padres habían visitado inesperadamente a la menor en el centro. La Policía los interceptó en el aeropuerto de Loiu cuando pretendían regresar a Marruecos y fueron puestos a disposición judicial.

Este impuesto, uno de los más regresivos del mundo, afecta por igual a todos los consumidores en productos básicos, lo que podría reducir el consumo y agravar la desigualdad. Aunque se presenta como una medida para reemplazar otros impuestos y mejorar la eficiencia económica, en la práctica los empresarios no suelen trasladar las reducciones fiscales a precios más bajos, mientras que los incrementos se aplican de inmediato al consumidor. El trasfondo de esta política refleja un modelo libertario donde la supuesta “libertad” se traduce en capacidad de pago, y los servicios públicos esenciales como salud, educación y alimentación quedan cada vez más sujetos a la lógica del mercado.

La protesta, debidamente comunicada, fue bloqueada por la policía, que retuvo a los manifestantes durante más de tres horas en un parking de la facultad de Derecho. Los colectivos denuncian que la actuación policial fue violenta, con cargas que causaron heridas a 12 personas, una de ellas trasladada al hospital, y múltiples identificaciones y retenciones arbitrarias. En contraste, se permitió la libre circulación de Vito Quiles y sus seguidores, llegando incluso a saltarse un cordón policial.

A través de una trabajadora social del centro especializado Cimascan, Sabina intentó durante años que la universidad adoptara medidas o investigara los hechos, pero la respuesta fue siempre negativa. La institución alegó que los casos de agresión sexual no podían tramitarse administrativamente, solo los de acoso, y que no existía una queja formal que activara su protocolo interno.

Sin embargo, en 2020 esa cifra se redujo al 4,3% a nivel mundial y apenas al 0,3% en países como Japón y Noruega. Esta notable disminución se debe a múltiples factores: mejoras en la nutrición, acceso a agua limpia, saneamiento, cuidados neonatales, vacunas, medicinas y reducción de la pobreza, conflictos y hambrunas. Antes de 1800, casi todos los padres perdían al menos un hijo; hoy en día, perder un hijo es una experiencia poco común. Los comentarios de los lectores resaltan ejemplos históricos y familiares que muestran cómo la mortalidad infantil afectaba generaciones pasadas, con niños falleciendo en la infancia o por enfermedades como la polio. Los testimonios también subrayan que gran parte del aumento de la esperanza de vida en el último siglo se debe a la reducción de muertes tempranas, más que a avances en la medicina para personas mayores.

Este huevo, uno de los 50 huevos imperiales Fabergé creados para las últimas dos emperatrices rusas, fue diseñado por Alma Pihl y se distingue por su cubierta de cuarzo con incrustaciones de platino y más de 1.500 diamantes en corte rosa que simulan copos de nieve. El interior del huevo revela una cesta de platino y diamantes con flores de cuarzo talladas, cuyas hojas están esculpidas en nefrita y decoradas con granates demantoides.

El trato desigual, la limitación de contacto con sus familias y la imposición de roles de servicio perpetuo caracterizaban este sistema. Testimonios detallan que las auxiliares trabajaban desde la mañana hasta la noche, con un ritmo inhumano y sin acceso a recreación, siendo en muchos casos sometidas a tratamientos psiquiátricos cuando mostraban dudas o rechazo a continuar.

Los radicales, en evidente estado de embriaguez, comenzaron a corear consignas neonazis, generando alarma entre los clientes, que en su mayoría eran personas ajenas a la violencia y algunos policías fuera de servicio. La situación escaló cuando varios de los ultras agredieron a un joven seguidor del Sevilla, que fue atendido por el Samur-Protección Civil con contusiones visibles en el rostro y la cabeza, aunque no necesitó hospitalización. La Policía Nacional acudió al lugar a los pocos minutos y logró controlar la pelea, evitando que se produjeran más incidentes.

El número 971 22 00 00, habitual para solicitar cita previa en Atención Primaria, está colapsado debido a una coincidencia de numerosas bajas en la plantilla. Según el IB-Salut, varias ausencias por Incapacidad Temporal, así como permisos de maternidad, vacaciones y otros permisos prolongados, han reducido de forma drástica el número de operadores disponibles, pese a que la plantilla total supera las 70 personas. La falta de personal ha provocado un aumento de las quejas, ya que muchos ciudadanos se han visto obligados a desplazarse directamente a los centros de salud para poder gestionar trámites básicos. Con el objetivo de paliar la situación, el IB-Salut ha incorporado 16 nuevos profesionales para cubrir las sustituciones. Sin embargo, al encontrarse estos en periodo de formació]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-servicio-telefonico-de-citas-medicas-en-baleares-sufre-una-semana-de-interrupciones-por-falta-de-personal</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-servicio-telefonico-de-citas-medicas-en-baleares-sufre-una-semana-de-interrupciones-por-falta-de-personal</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:13:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Agricultura había señalado a Catalunya como zona de riesgo de peste porcina por el aumento de jabalíes]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ministerio de Agricultura ya advertía hace año y medio del riesgo de brotes de peste porcina africana (PPA) en Catalunya, especialmente debido a la alta densidad de jabalíes en zonas cercanas a carreteras con intenso tránsito internacional como la AP-7. Según el plan nacional, la presencia de restos de comida procedentes del exterior dejados en áreas de descanso podría haber sido el foco de contagio inicial. Las autoridades explican que la PPA no supone riesgo para las personas, pero sí para la economía y las explotaciones porcinas. El informe destacaba que, aunque la densidad de jabalíes es elevada en el litoral catalán, la interacción entre cerdos domésticos y salvajes es relativamente baja, limitando la propagación a explotaciones agrícolas. Para controlar el aumento de jabalíes, el documento propone combinar la caza con medidas complementarias como trampas y drones térmicos, así como controlar el acceso de estos animales a restos de comida en áreas periurbanas, zonas de recreo o]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-agricultura-habia-senalado-a-catalunya-como-zona-de-riesgo-de-peste-porcina-por-el-aumento-de-jabalies</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-ministerio-de-agricultura-habia-senalado-a-catalunya-como-zona-de-riesgo-de-peste-porcina-por-el-aumento-de-jabalies</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:41:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Experiencia de un médico español en Gaza durante el conflicto de 2025]]></title><description><![CDATA[Raúl Incertis Jarillo, médico especialista en urgencias y anestesia de Madrid, trabajó durante cuatro meses en la Franja de Gaza en 2025 como cooperante de una ONG dependiente de la OMS. Su labor se centró en el Hospital Nasser de Jan Yunis, donde atendió a víctimas del conflicto entre Hamás e Israel. Durante su estancia, presenció a diario escenas de extrema violencia, con numerosos niños, mujeres y adultos mutilados por bombardeos y enfrentamientos armados. Los recursos hospitalarios eran extremadamente limitados, con escasez de anestésicos, gasas, compresas, antibióticos y, sobre todo, personal médico para atender a oleadas masivas de heridos, que a veces llegaban a cientos en pocas horas. Raúl destaca la labor de los periodistas locales, que documentaban la situación mientras Israel impedía la entrada de comunicadores extranjeros. La experiencia ha dejado una huella emocional profunda en el cooperante, quien subraya que los colegios médicos deberían pronunciarse oficialmente sobre ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experiencia-de-un-medico-espanol-en-gaza-durante-el-conflicto-de-2025</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/experiencia-de-un-medico-espanol-en-gaza-durante-el-conflicto-de-2025</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 13:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hombre de 37 años en estado crítico tras agresión en Lleida]]></title><description><![CDATA[Facundo, un hombre de 37 años, permanece en la Unidad de Cuidados Intensivos (UCI) en estado muy grave tras ser víctima de una agresión múltiple en una zona de bares de Lleida la madrugada del 23 de noviembre. Según la familia, el ataque fue brutal: golpeado por detrás con un objeto contundente, sufrió una fractura de cráneo y continuó recibiendo patadas mientras estaba en el suelo. Fue operado en dos ocasiones debido a hemorragias que ponían en peligro su vida. La policía detuvo a un adolescente, aunque la agresión involucró a varias personas. La hermana y la madre de Facundo han denunciado que el joven no tuvo oportunidad de defenderse y explican que los agresores podrían ser de origen magrebí según testimonios de testigos. El caso ha generado conmoción en la ciudad y alerta sobre la violencia en espacios públicos.

Personas desempleadas, como Sofía, se ven obligadas a recurrir a intermediarios que cobran entre 30 y 99 euros por citas que deberían ser gratuitas. Estos intermediarios utilizan herramientas informáticas y bots para reservar múltiples citas, revendiéndolas después a quienes las necesitan con urgencia, lo que genera un colapso adicional en el servicio público. El Ministerio de Trabajo ha presentado denuncias ante la Policía y ha implementado medidas antifraude, como límites por DNI y liberación aleatoria de citas canceladas, aunque los sindicatos alertan de que la raíz del problema es la falta de personal. Entre 2022 y 2025, el SEPE ha perdido miles de empleados por jubilación y recortes, mientras la demanda de citas sigue creciendo. Los sindicatos y representantes de los colegios profesionales también denuncian que algunos intermediarios falsifican su identidad para aparentar legitimidad.

Microsoft lanzó esta actualización con el objetivo de mejorar aspectos no relacionados con la seguridad, incluyendo la adopción del modo oscuro, pero los resultados han sido contrarios a lo esperado. Uno de los errores más notorios provoca un destello blanco al abrir el Explorador de archivos con el modo oscuro activado. Este destello, aunque breve, ocurre cada vez que se realizan acciones como abrir nuevas pestañas, navegar por el menú lateral o activar/desactivar el panel de detalles, convirtiéndose en una experiencia molesta para los usuarios. Otro fallo afecta a la pantalla de bloqueo, donde el botón para ingresar manualmente la contraseña no se muestra aunque sigue funcionando al pasar el cursor por su ubicación.

La decisión revoca parcialmente la sentencia previa del Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias, que había considerado que el decreto autonómico de 2022 discriminaba la asignatura de Religión al no ofrecer alternativa a los alumnos que no la cursen. Según el Supremo, esta ausencia no constituye discriminación, ya que los estudiantes de Religión tienen 31 horas lectivas semanales frente a las 30 de los demás, cumpliendo la proporcionalidad exigida por la legislación. La sentencia recuerda que la medida fue acordada con la Conferencia Episcopal y reafirma la jurisprudencia previa sobre el derecho de los padres a que sus hijos reciban formación religiosa acorde con sus convicciones. Asimismo, el Alto Tribunal aclara que la calificación en Religión no debe afectar a ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-supremo-confirma-que-no-es-obligatorio-ofrecer-asignatura-alternativa-a-religion-en-bachillerato</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-tribunal-supremo-confirma-que-no-es-obligatorio-ofrecer-asignatura-alternativa-a-religion-en-bachillerato</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2025 12:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
