Federal officials, including President Trump at a White House news conference, publicized a list of about 240 names, often accompanied by mugshots, to emphasize the severity of the threats posed by these individuals. However, a detailed investigation by the Minnesota Star Tribune, reviewing thousands of pages of court documents, prison records, and other public sources, presents a more complex reality. Roughly 80% of those listed have felony convictions, including serious crimes like murder, rape, assault, drug offenses, theft, and fraud. Examples include Aldrin Guerrero-Munoz, convicted of second-degree murder in 2005 for killing his]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/star-tribune-investigation-reviews-trump-administration-s-worst-of-the-worst-immigrant-list-in-minnesota</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/star-tribune-investigation-reviews-trump-administration-s-worst-of-the-worst-immigrant-list-in-minnesota</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Macron announces €300 billion European savings to be invested locally with the establishment of the S&I Union]]></title><description><![CDATA[French President Emmanuel Macron announced a major financial initiative aimed at retaining European capital within Europe. According to Macron, approximately €300 billion of European savings, which have historically been invested in the United States each year, will now be redirected to support investments within the European Union. This decision comes after a unanimous agreement among all 27 EU member states to establish the S&I Union, which represents a significant step toward creating a fully integrated European Capital Market. The move is expected to strengthen Europe's economic independence, increase investment opportunities within member states, and foster financial stability across the region. Experts suggest that by redirecting these funds, Europe could see enhanced funding for infrastructure projects, technological innovation, and sustainable development. The S&I Union is designed to facilitate cross-border investments and harmonize financial regulations among EU countries, cr]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/macron-announces-300-billion-european-savings-to-be-invested-locally-with-the-establishment-of-the-s-i-union</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/macron-announces-300-billion-european-savings-to-be-invested-locally-with-the-establishment-of-the-s-i-union</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structural Challenges Threaten Spanish High-Speed Rail Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article discusses potential causes behind a recent derailment on the high-speed rail line near Adamuz, Spain. The author analyzes the failure of a specific rail section near a weld and suggests that the accident may not be an isolated incident but rather indicative of a structural problem. Observations indicate that thermal tension or pre-existing cracks were unlikely contributors, leaving possible welding defects or steel processing issues as likely causes. Beyond this individual failure, the article highlights broader issues with Spain's high-speed rail network, which was designed for lower traffic volumes and lighter trains. The network is now operating under stress from heavier trains and increased traffic, raising maintenance challenges that may be economically and operationally unsustainable. Possible solutions include reducing train weight and frequency or upgrading infrastructure to meet higher demands, both of which would be costly and could be perceived as a major setback]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/structural-challenges-threaten-spanish-high-speed-rail-network</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/structural-challenges-threaten-spanish-high-speed-rail-network</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:33:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kim Kardashian Clarifies Elephant-Skin Birkin Bag Was Fake Prop on 'All's Fair' Set, Regrets Not Addressing Backlash Sooner]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kim Kardashian recently addressed a viral controversy surrounding a Hermès Birkin bag that appeared to be made from elephant skin, which she carried while filming her Hulu legal drama series 'All's Fair.' The accessory sparked significant outrage in November 2025 from animal rights groups and celebrities like Ireland Baldwin, who called it 'disgusting and shameful,' due to ethical concerns over exotic animal materials in luxury fashion and Hermès' alleged past use of elephant hides from the 1980s. Initially, Kardashian remained silent, citing feeling overwhelmed by the negative reactions and concurrent scrutiny over her show. In a January 2026 episode of her sister Khloé Kardashian's podcast 'Khloé in Wonder Land,' she explained that the bag was not from her personal collection nor authentic. Instead, it was a prop brought in for wardrobe purposes during filming, along with other replica items left on set for convenience in styling scenes.

The bank estimates that tech companies and others will spend around $1 trillion on AI-related capital expenditures, including data centers, chips, and power grid enhancements, yet there is currently little tangible benefit or evidence of payoff. Drawing from interviews with Goldman Sachs economists, MIT professor Daron Acemoglu, and infrastructure experts, the report highlights concerns about whether scaling training data further will resolve core issues, as data quality matters more than quantity and high-quality sources may be scarce. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, expressed strong skepticism, noting that generative AI remains unreliable for even basic tasks like summarization, often producing nonsensical results, and cited internal tests where AI was six times more expensive than manu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/goldman-sachs-questions-generative-ai-s-economic-viability-amid-massive-investments-and-limited-returns</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Minneapolis General Strike Inspires Solidarity Actions in Over 120 Cities Nationwide]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Minneapolis General Strike, initially organized by the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation and the Minnesota AFL-CIO, is rapidly gaining national attention. Workers across Minnesota have planned a 'Day of Truth and Freedom' strike, with thousands expected to participate in the Twin Cities. This local strike has inspired solidarity actions in at least 120 cities across the United States, signaling a growing labor movement against ICE operations in Minneapolis. Payday Report has been tracking these solidarity events and has provided an interactive map to visualize the nationwide participation. The movement reflects collaboration among labor unions, community organizations, and immigrant rights groups, aiming to create a model for collective action against federal raids. According to CWA Local 7520 President Keiran Knutson, tens of thousands of workers could join in Minnesota, with similar mobilizations appearing in other regions.

In the third quarter of 2025, the top 1% of households owned 31.7% of all U.S. wealth, the largest share recorded since tracking began in 1989. This group held approximately $55 trillion in assets, roughly matching the combined wealth of the bottom 90% of Americans. The trend highlights a persistent K-shaped economic recovery, where low- and middle-income households experience stalled or slowed wealth growth, while the richest pull further ahead. Experts attribute the widening gap to several factors, including surging stock market gains driven by investments in artificial intelligence, which disproportionately benefit wealthier households with higher stock ownership. In contrast, middle-income families have more wealth tied to real estate, where price growth has moderated. Uneven wage increases also play a role, with higher-income groups seeing stronger ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/top-1-of-us-households-reach-record-31-7-share-of-wealth-in-q3-2025-per-federal-reserve-data</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/top-1-of-us-households-reach-record-31-7-share-of-wealth-in-q3-2025-per-federal-reserve-data</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Drops Greenland Tariff Threats After Davos Speech and NATO Talks, But Tensions Persist with European Leaders]]></title><description><![CDATA[In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 21, 2026, US President Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the US to acquire Greenland from Denmark, framing it as a reasonable transaction due to historical US military support to Europe and criticizing allies for not contributing enough to NATO. He claimed the US had been wrong to 'give back' Greenland after World War II (a historical inaccuracy, as Greenland was never US territory) and mocked several leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Trump ruled out using military force to take Greenland but insisted on negotiations for outright ownership. He also referenced a quip that without the US, Europeans would be 'speaking German,' which drew criticism for being insulting and inaccurate, especially in multilingual Switzerland. Initially, Trump threatened 10% tariffs starting February 1 on goods from eight European countries (including Denmark, Germany, France, UK, and others) opposing his Greenland ambitions.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-drops-greenland-tariff-threats-after-davos-speech-and-nato-talks-but-tensions-persist-with-european-leaders</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-drops-greenland-tariff-threats-after-davos-speech-and-nato-talks-but-tensions-persist-with-european-leaders</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kyiv Faces Mass Exodus Amid Russian Strikes on Energy Infrastructure and Severe Winter Blackouts]]></title><description><![CDATA[In January 2026, Kyiv experienced intense Russian missile and drone attacks targeting energy infrastructure, resulting in widespread power, heating, and water outages across the capital and nearby regions like Chernihiv. Ukrainian officials reported that up to 80% of Kyiv lost electricity, with over a million residents affected and many buildings without heat during temperatures plummeting to -18°C in a prolonged cold snap. Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced that around 600,000 people had fled the city in January alone, based on mobile phone data, out of a pre-war population of roughly 3 million, equating to a 20-25% decline. Authorities urged further evacuations to avoid a humanitarian crisis, while considering shutting down the metro to conserve power. The parliament operated remotely due to uninhabitable conditions in the building, and nuclear power plants remained the primary electricity source amid accusations that Russia might target them.

These encounters occurred even though the officers were U.S. citizens and in some cases attempted to record the interactions. Bruley stated that this behavior is part of a broader pattern of civil rights complaints received from the community, noting that if trained officers who understand constitutional rights are being targeted, it raises serious concerns for the general public. He emphasized that these incidents are not isolated, with other law enforcement chiefs confirming similar experiences with their off-duty officers. Bruley criticized the manner in which ICE is enforcing immigration laws, though he clarified that he does not support abolishing the agency entirely.

It emphasizes the importance of balancing creativity with practicality, noting that socks function as both fashion statements and wearable objects subject to stretch, motion, and structural limitations. A good sock design, according to the piece, focuses on visual clarity, durability, and adaptability to the fabric's behavior. Clear, bold patterns outperform intricate artwork, since socks are viewed mostly from a distance, and small details can disappear or distort when worn.

The text highlights several effective design approaches such as using minimal line icons, micro-patterns, and directional stripes to create visually balanced and functional results. It points out that large motifs with ample negative space or abstract color blocks can conceal distortion well, while simple botanical silhouettes and restrained typography add personality without losing legibility.

According to Bessent, sanctions intentionally targeted Iran’s access to global financial networks and oil revenue, cutting it off from foreign reserves. By December 2025, the Iranian rial had lost over 80% of its value, triggering inflation exceeding 40% and dramatic spikes in food prices, which fueled public unrest.

Despite this economic hardship, the article argues that the sanctions have also strengthened Iran’s determination and pushed it toward greater cooperation with adversaries of the United States. Iran has adopted methods to circumvent restrictions, such as operating a 'ghost fleet' of tankers to continue crude exports—mostly to China, which now purchases about 90% of Iranian oil at discounted prices. Additionally, Iran’s alliance with Ru]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-sanctions-deepen-iran-s-economic-crisis-but-strengthen-its-alliances-with-russia-and-china</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/u-s-sanctions-deepen-iran-s-economic-crisis-but-strengthen-its-alliances-with-russia-and-china</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Historic speech (SUB) of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney against D.Trump's Imperialism]]></title><description><![CDATA[The video features a subtitled speech by Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, where he critiques what he describes as economic policies reminiscent of imperialist practices, seemingly in reference to the policies of Donald Trump.

The document, attributed to Acting Director Todd Lyons, was shared with Senator Richard Blumenthal by whistleblowers represented by Whistleblower Aid. It marks a significant shift from prior DHS policy, which traditionally required judicial warrants signed by judges for home entry. The memo cites guidance from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of General Counsel stating that neither the Constitution nor immigration laws prohibit this practice. The directive specifies that ICE officers must identify themselves, announce their purpose, allow time for compliance, and generally avoid raids between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., using only reasonable force if necessary.

Rather than reacting defensively, the EU should proactively use the crisis to encourage Iceland and Norway to revive their EU membership bids. In Iceland, the government has committed to a plebiscite by 2027 on resuming EU accession talks, and recent polls show a relative majority supporting membership for the first time since 2015, driven by fears of NATO unreliability under U.S. assertiveness. In Norway, support for EU accession has reached historic highs since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with a majority favoring a new referendum and the Conservative Party framing membership as a strategic security necessity amid potential transatlantic strains.

He described his speech as well-received and based on common sense rather than ideology. The article highlights this as evidence of Trump's normalization of authoritarian rhetoric, set against his aggressive diplomatic stance, including threats toward Europe, Canada, Greenland, and Iceland. Trump's Davos speech focused on pushing for U.S. control of Greenland for security reasons, confusing it with Iceland at times, and threatening tariffs on European allies opposing the move. In response, the EU suspended progress on a U.S. trade deal, and pension funds in Denmark and Sweden began divesting from U.S. Treasuries due to policy unpredictability.

He described the current global situation as a 'rupture, not a transition,' where economic tools like tariffs and supply chains are increasingly weaponized, and major powers act with fewer constraints. Carney urged middle powers, such as Canada, to abandon complacency and adopt a 'value-based realism'—a principled yet pragmatic approach grounded in human rights, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the prohibition of force except under the UN Charter.

The first transaction generated $500 million, with $300 million routed through Qatari banks to Venezuela's interim government under Delcy Rodríguez. These funds aim to stabilize the devaluing bolívar by injecting them into the currency market. The deal stems from Trump's announced plan for Venezuela to supply 30-50 million barrels to the US at market prices (around $56 per barrel), potentially worth up to $2.8 billion, shifting from discounted sales.

In late December 2025, Spotify, Sony, Warner, and Universal Music Group filed a sealed lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York accusing the site of copyright infringement. On January 2, 2026, a judge granted an ex parte temporary restraining order directing domain registry Public Interest Registry (PIR) and Cloudflare to disable access to Anna’s Archive domains to prevent further distribution of copyrighted material. Anna’s Archive was not notified until after implementation, as plaintiffs feared preemptive release of the scraped songs or infrastructure relocation. The site’s operator initially attributed the early January .org domain suspension to routine shadow library issues unrelated to Spotify. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spotify-and-major-labels-secure-us-court-order-to-suspend-anna-s-archive-domains-over-alleged-spotify-scraping</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/spotify-and-major-labels-secure-us-court-order-to-suspend-anna-s-archive-domains-over-alleged-spotify-scraping</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 12:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Common Design Errors in Enamel Pins and Practical Solutions for Better Production]]></title><description><![CDATA[Designing enamel pins seems simple due to their small size, bold shapes, and limited colors, but many designs fail in production because they ignore the physical realities of metal manufacturing. Enamel pins are not digital prints; they involve constraints like minimum line widths for metal formation, color separation requirements, plating effects, and tight tolerances. This article outlines ten frequent mistakes made by designers and provides clear fixes. Key issues include using lines that are too thin for metal durability, cramming excessive detail into tiny 1-1.5 inch sizes leading to visual clutter, incorporating tiny or unsuitable text that becomes illegible, overloading with too many colors or poor separation increasing complexity and cost, relying on gradients and soft shadows that do not translate to flat enamel fills, overlooking how metal plating color affects overall contrast and mood, failing to include a defined border or safety margins causing uneven edges, creating low-]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/common-design-errors-in-enamel-pins-and-practical-solutions-for-better-production</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 11:58:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study Shows Persistent Villous Atrophy in Many Adult Celiac Patients on Long-Term Gluten-Free Diet, But Lamina Propria Immune Normalization Occurs]]></title><description><![CDATA[A recent study led by Aida Fiz López, published in Clinical and Experimental Immunology, investigated why many adult celiac disease patients continue to show intestinal mucosal damage despite years of strict gluten-free diet adherence. The research analyzed duodenal biopsies from 19 celiac patients (average 7 years on diet), compared to newly diagnosed patients and healthy controls, using advanced spectral cytometry to examine 72 immune cell populations. Results revealed that 68.4% of patients on the diet still had persistent villous atrophy. Notably, only one patient showed gluten traces in feces, confirming good dietary compliance in the others, and most had negative serology (antibodies). Despite the ongoing atrophy, the immune infiltrate in the lamina propria (including NK cells, B cells, regulatory T cells, and others altered at diagnosis) fully normalized in all diet-treated patients.

Firming products primarily work on the skin's surface and upper layers by enhancing hydration, improving texture for better light reflection, and supporting elasticity, resulting in plumper, smoother, and more resilient-looking skin. The article emphasizes that true 'all-over lift' comes from better hydration to reduce crepiness, smoother texture, and gradual resilience rather than dramatic physical lifting. A simple morning routine should include a gentle cleanse, a lightweight firming serum or treatment, a hydrating moisturizer, and most importantly, daily broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent UV damage, which accelerates loss of firmness. At night, focus on deeper nourishment: thorough cleansing followed by a targeted firming treatment and a richer moisturizer to repair and soften dry]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/building-an-effective-firming-skincare-routine-for-improved-skin-elasticity-and-lifted-appearance</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/building-an-effective-firming-skincare-routine-for-improved-skin-elasticity-and-lifted-appearance</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 10:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Capital One Shopping Rewards Limited to Southwest Rapid Rewards Points Purchases, Not Flight Bookings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Capital One Shopping, a popular browser extension and service that provides cashback rewards and coupons, has been sending targeted emails highlighting 'Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards' as an offer.

The card, once celebrated for its simplicity and generous travel perks, now offers a wide array of complicated credits and coupons. Greg explains that determining the card’s value depends on how effectively a cardholder uses those benefits, particularly new additions such as The Edit travel credits, StubHub rebates, Lyft and DoorDash credits, and entertainment subscriptions like Apple TV+ and Apple Music. 

To assess whether the card is worth keeping, Greg introduces a personal evaluation method using his 'bundling' approach. Instead of pricing each coupon individually, he groups related benefits—like travel perks or miscellaneous lifestyle credits—and estimates how much he would realistically pay for those bundles.

This represents an 81% increase since 2020. The collective wealth grew by $2.5 trillion in 2025 alone, nearly matching the total wealth of the bottom half of humanity (4.1 billion people) and enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. The number of billionaires exceeded 3,000 for the first time, with Elon Musk becoming the first to surpass half a trillion dollars. The report, titled 'Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power,' highlights how this extreme wealth concentration enables the super-rich to gain disproportionate political power, including through tax cuts for the wealthy, weakened corporate regulations, and media ownership.

A recent systematic review published in Advances in Bamboo Science analyzed decades of research, including human trials, animal studies, and lab work, on bamboo shoots and derived compounds. Key findings indicate that bamboo shoots are rich in dietary fiber, such as cellulose and lignin, which supports digestion, gut health, regularity, and possibly beneficial gut bacteria. Early human studies suggest benefits for metabolic health, including better blood sugar regulation and improved cholesterol levels, which could lower risks for diabetes and heart disease.

Authorities deployed riot gear, water cannons, chemical irritants, and rubber bullets after protesters allegedly threw stones and fireworks; no injuries were reported. The protests were fueled by Trump's persistent threats to acquire Greenland from Denmark for US security reasons, including refusing to rule out military action and proposing tariffs on European countries supporting Denmark.

He claims that the people of Greenland, described derogatorily as living on a 'desolate ice ball,' are being paid to reject a supposed generous American offer of $100,000 per person. Kimble argues that no one would turn down such a large sum out of pure principle, implying the protests lack authenticity. He advocates for Greenland's annexation, noting its population of over 56,000 is about one-tenth that of Wyoming, and absurdly suggests it should therefore receive Senate representation comparable to California's 40 million residents despite the constitutional two-senators-per-state rule.

Unlike standard doors, fire doors are constructed with solid cores, fire-resistant materials, and intumescent seals that expand under heat to seal gaps, typically resisting fire for 30 to 60 minutes. This containment limits damage, reduces smoke inhalation risks, and helps maintain clearer escape routes, especially in critical areas like stairwells, hallways, and landings in multi-storey homes. The article highlights how fire doors protect escape paths by keeping temperatures lower and visibility better for longer periods. Modern advancements include fire-rated glass panels that allow natural light to pass between rooms without compromising safety, as these panels are tested to withstand high temperatures and prevent flame passage.

This tool offers various defensive measures, such as imposing punitive tariffs, refusing patent recognition, and excluding certain US products or companies from the European market. However, the article argues that the ACI is merely a toolbox of retaliatory options rather than a decisive weapon. The real potential 'bazooka' lies in Europe's massive holdings of US Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated assets. European investors collectively hold around eight trillion dollars in these securities, effectively financing a significant portion of America's substantial public debt.

According to Max's account in the video, the other player repeatedly called him an 'illegal immigrant' despite Max emphasizing that he was born in the United States. The bully also allegedly used profanity, made racist comments mocking Max for not being white, and threatened that President Donald Trump would 'get' him and deport him to another country. Max expressed deep hurt and confusion, stating through sobs that he has no other home and doesn't understand why children say such cruel things. He added that the remarks made him feel very sad and questioned why some kids act as if they have power over others. The incident, captured on video and shared by the parent, has gone viral and ignited online discussions about the impact of political rhetoric on children, the early onset of racist bullying, and how dehumanizing la]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/12-year-old-u-s-born-boy-bullied-and-called-illegal-immigrant-during-youth-soccer-game-video-shows-emotional-reaction</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/12-year-old-u-s-born-boy-bullied-and-called-illegal-immigrant-during-youth-soccer-game-video-shows-emotional-reaction</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 23:40:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump Delivers Rambling Speech on Greenland, Windmills, and Europe at Davos WEF]]></title><description><![CDATA[On January 21, 2026, President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in a lengthy and often incoherent speech that drew little reaction from the audience, which remained largely silent. He criticized immigration in Europe, stating that some places are no longer recognizable and are heading in the wrong direction, echoing far-right sentiments. Trump repeatedly targeted windmills, labeling them financial losers and incorrectly claiming China manufactures them but has no operational wind farms, despite China's position as the world leader in wind energy. A significant portion focused on his push to acquire Greenland from Denmark for U.S. and global security, mistakenly referring to it as Iceland multiple times, calling it a 'piece of ice' essential for protection, and warning of consequences if refused, while claiming he would not use force. He revisited claims of a rigged 2020 election and took credit for various global positives.

He claimed the U.S. dollar has weakened by 28% over the past five years, describing inflation as a 'scam' that allows politicians to obscure real economic impacts. Using a personal example, Scaramucci noted that his parents purchased a house in 1962 for $16,000, equivalent to 457 ounces of gold at $35 per ounce. Today, a similar house is valued at $750,000, but at current gold prices of around $3,300 per ounce, it equates to only 227 ounces—demonstrating a loss in real value despite nominal gains. He emphasized that people often mistake larger dollar figures for increased wealth, when in reality the currency's value has declined. Scaramucci pointed out that $1 million today has roughly the purchasing power of $80,000 in 1970, though official U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data suggests a closer figu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anthony-scaramucci-highlights-how-inflation-erodes-purchasing-power-over-decades</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/anthony-scaramucci-highlights-how-inflation-erodes-purchasing-power-over-decades</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:22:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Viera Babecova Explores Dark Elegance in Her Moody Flower Photography]]></title><description><![CDATA[Slovak photographer Viera Babecova presents a striking collection of floral images that capture the intimate beauty of nature through dramatic lighting and impeccable symmetry. Her series, part of the ongoing project 'Miracles in Gardens,' reimagines flowers not simply as botanical subjects but as poetic expressions of balance, precision, and depth. Each bloom is photographed against a deep black background, allowing petals and textures to emerge from shadow with an almost sculptural presence. The use of reflected or symmetrical compositions enhances the sense of harmony and order, while the subdued color palette and moody lighting evoke quiet emotion. Babecova’s approach emphasizes the organic geometry of each plant, bringing attention to subtle variations in form and tone. The result is a collection that feels both natural and meticulously composed, inviting viewers to perceive flowers as mysterious and powerful symbols of life and decay.

Drawing on reports from Israel’s public broadcaster Kan 11, journalist Jonathan Ofir describes how fruit growers, particularly those producing citrus and mangoes, warn of a potential collapse. European buyers are avoiding Israeli fruits, while the Houthi blockade in the Red Sea has caused major shipping disruptions to Asian markets. Together, these pressures have left Russia as one of the few remaining destinations for Israeli produce — creating what one farmer calls an 'alliance of the boycotted.' 

The report highlights the rapid decline of once-iconic exports like Jaffa oranges, emblematic of Israel’s agricultural brand, which also carries a history of cultural appropriation from Palestinian farming traditions.

However, escalating tensions between the US and European allies over President Donald Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland—accompanied by tariff threats against Denmark and other NATO members—shifted the focus away from Ukraine-related agreements. According to reports from Axios and the Financial Times, the dispute overshadowed preparations, leading to the postponement of any formal signing or major announcement involving Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and European leaders.

This stems from his escalating efforts to acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he claims is essential for U.S. national security in the Arctic. Trump has refused to rule out military force and recently sent a letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, stating he 'no longer feel[s] an obligation to think purely of Peace' after not receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2025, which was awarded to Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado.

The situation has escalated Trump's public spats with European leaders, with Ursula von der Leyen criticizing his tariffs threats and highlighting Europe’s Arctic policing capabilities.

He referenced Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado's symbolic regifting of her Nobel Peace Prize to Trump as an example.

Business leaders expressed frustration with perpetual pilot projects that fail to scale due to poor data quality, undefined processes, and weak governance. Experts like PwC's Mohamed Kande emphasized the need for top-down strategies focusing on high-impact use cases that directly affect revenue, costs, or customer experience, integrating AI into core business operations with clear productivity metrics. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warned that if AI benefits remain concentrated in big tech, it risks becoming a bubble rather than a productive revolution, stressing democratization for gains in health, education, public sectors, and SMEs.

Denmark is portrayed as a colonial power that has gradually granted autonomy, including a 31-seat parliament (Inatsisartut) and EU exit in 1985. The political scene features five parties: the pro-Denmark Democratic Party (10 seats), nationalist Naleraq (8 seats, fast independence), ecosocialist Inuit Ataqatigiit (7 seats, gradual independence), center-left Siumut, and conservative unionist Atassut (2 seats).

This shift occurred as the EU drastically reduced Russian gas imports following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, dropping from 50 percent to 12 percent, with a full ban on Russian gas phased in. Projections indicate that by 2030, nearly half of the EU's gas could come from the US, representing up to 80 percent of its LNG imports, according to data from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). This growing dependency creates a significant geopolitical risk, especially as transatlantic relations deteriorate under US President Donald Trump.

Melasma, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is often aggravated by UV exposure or tanning beds and can appear as brown or gray spots that sometimes itch or irritate the skin.

The messages, allegedly exchanged between Lively and Swift in late 2024, reference interactions with Baldoni, whom Lively has accused of sexual harassment and retaliation. Baldoni denies these allegations. One quoted message from Swift reads, 'I think this bitch knows something is coming because he’s gotten out his tiny violin,' though Lively’s attorneys emphasized that the message does not indicate discussion of a forthcoming news article. Other messages concern a revised script draft for which Lively reportedly asked Swift for support.

This means the final day to transfer Citi ThankYou points to Aeromexico is January 24, 2026, leaving a short window of less than a week from the article's publication date of January 20, 2026. The announcement was originally made by Citi last month, and it only impacts future transfers—prior transfers remain unaffected. The article advises against rushing to transfer points, as Aeromexico's loyalty program offers limited valuable redemption opportunities, often referred to as lacking strong 'sweet spots' for award bookings. Additionally, a better alternative exists for those interested in Aeromexico: American Express Membership Rewards points transfer to Aeromexico at a more favorable ratio of 1,000:1,600, providing significantly higher value compared to Citi's 1:1 ratio.

These promotions are available depending on the user's specific credit card accounts and can be activated through the respective banks' offer portals. The Amex Offer provides 20% back on up to $150 in spending, resulting in a maximum $30 statement credit for a single qualifying purchase of car rentals made directly at turo.com or via the Turo app, with an expiration date of March 31, 2026. It applies to reservations in the US and Canada, requires the vehicle to be returned and paid for by the end date, and excludes gift cards, prior trips, or direct host payments.

CNN correspondent John King reported from rural Iowa, highlighting the case of cattle rancher Shanen Ebersole from Kellerton, who voted for Trump but now strongly opposes his renewed push to acquire or annex Greenland, viewing it as unrelated to the 'America First' priorities she expected. She rated his performance a 3 out of 5, appreciating some improvements in border security and the economy but criticizing distractions like Greenland and trade policies favoring imports (e.g., low-tariff beef from Argentina). Ebersole indicated she is open to voting Democratic in the upcoming midterms, where Iowa will elect a governor, senator, and all four House members.

Key lifestyle habits include staying well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water to keep skin elastic and glowing, eating a balanced diet rich in fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats to combat free radicals and support collagen production, getting sufficient quality sleep for skin cell renewal, and managing stress to prevent premature aging signs.

The footage circulated widely on social media, sparking outrage from Jewish organizations, elected officials, and the public. The nightclub apologized, condemned antisemitism, and fired three employees while banning the personalities involved. They also implemented stricter content controls and management oversight to prevent similar incidents in the future. The song, which glorifies Hitler and has been banned on multiple streaming platforms, intensified concerns about far-right extremist influence and antisemitic rhetoric.

Defense officials, speaking anonymously, indicated that the troops could be mobilized if President Donald Trump decides to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807—a rarely used law allowing the president to deploy active-duty military forces domestically for law enforcement purposes in cases of rebellion or when local authorities cannot maintain order.

Over this seven-year period, the party generated ordinary losses of approximately 1.29 million euros, which it offset by selling historical real estate assets worth 1.56 million euros, with the majority of sales (1.44 million euros) occurring between 2021 and 2023. Without these asset liquidations, the PCE would have recorded unsustainable deficits in its operations. Total ordinary income reached 13.16 million euros, with about 70% classified as private sources and 30% as direct public funding—contrasting sharply with major parties like the PP (83% public) and PSOE (68% public).

The government is reforming the Hydrocarbons Law to introduce Productive Participation Contracts, enabling foreign capital and technology—particularly from US firms like Chevron and ExxonMobil—to revitalize the oil sector and boost production. A key initial step was signing a contract for exporting liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), aligning with expressed US interests under Donald Trump in leading Venezuela's energy reactivation. To address social emergencies and high inflation, two new sovereign funds were created: one for direct social protection (supporting workers, health, and education) and another for urgent infrastructure repairs in water, electricity, and roads, both funded by oil revenues.

This deal, finalized in July 2025 after prolonged negotiations, aimed to reduce tariffs on US industrial goods entering the EU market and resolve ongoing trade disputes, including previous US impositions of 15% tariffs on EU exports. The delay serves as a symbolic yet impactful protest against President Donald Trump's recent threats to impose new tariffs on several EU member states—particularly France and Germany—if they do not support US acquisition of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Gold remains a reliable and stable investment due to its status as a globally traded commodity, liquidity, and responsiveness to economic conditions like inflation, currency fluctuations, and industrial demand. Higher-karat pieces hold value particularly well, making gold a low-risk option for buyers seeking consistent worth. Diamonds present more challenges: while certified natural diamonds with strong quality, size, and ethical sourcing can retain or appreciate in value, their market is pressured by the widespread adoption of lab-grown alternatives (now around 40% of new carats), leading to greater volatility and lower resale for many stones. Provenance, condition, and certification are critical for diamonds to perform well.

It emphasizes that 'neurodivergent' is not a diagnosis but a descriptive term referring to differences in brain functioning linked to conditions like ADHD or autism. Understanding one’s neurodivergence typically requires multiple approaches rather than a single test or moment of revelation. 

The piece presents six methods for self-exploration. First, online evaluations can serve as a gentle introduction to neurodiversity, though they should not replace professional diagnosis. Second, traveling mindfully can reveal sensory sensitivities, executive functioning differences, or emotional regulation challenges—travel disruptions often magnify these traits. Third, research and reading first-hand accounts offer a grounded understanding of how neurodivergence expresses itself in daily life.

The article highlights ongoing tensions between the United States and Denmark, which administers Greenland as an autonomous territory. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland for its critical Arctic position, vast mineral resources, and role in missile defense and surveillance. The U.S. already maintains the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland under a defense agreement with Denmark, supporting NATO missions for missile warning and space surveillance.

The US president shared an AI-generated image depicting himself and senior political allies planting an American flag on Greenlandic soil, labelled as a future US territory. Speaking to reporters, Trump questioned Denmark’s sovereignty over the island, arguing that historical claims do not constitute legitimate ownership and insisting that Denmark lacks the capacity to protect Greenland from geopolitical threats.

Trump linked his Greenland ambitions to broader security concerns, repeatedly citing NATO and his own role in pressuring alliance members to increase defence spending. He claimed credit for strengthening NATO and said he had recently discussed Greenland with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, with plans for further talks involving international leaders in Davos.

He highlighted their tireless efforts to deliver essential aid despite significant challenges. Hamilton emphasized that while witnessing the situation on the ground could easily lead to feelings of hopelessness, the spirit and determination of those involved left him inspired instead.

Francken claimed that the European Union is preparing for various scenarios in response to rising geopolitical tensions surrounding Greenland. The concerns revolve around the possibility of U.S. military or economic actions to take control of Greenland, a Danish territory. Although Francken acknowledged that Europe could not militarily confront the United States, he emphasized that Belgium and other EU nations are discussing contingency strategies, referring vaguely to a so-called 'plan B'. He admitted that such a plan would not amount to an actual military option but rather a coordinated political and logistical response in the event of violations against Denmark’s territorial integrity.

The declaration reserves the right to conduct preemptive attacks upon detecting 'objective signs of threat,' moving away from a purely reactive posture of deterrence toward what Tehran calls 'active and unpredictable deterrence.' This shift implies that Iran now views the risks of continued strategic patience as exceeding those of proactive measures in certain scenarios. The term 'objective signs' remains intentionally vague, potentially encompassing intelligence evaluations, military deployments, cyber operations, or even hostile political statements, allowing broad interpretation. Iranian officials and experts frame this as a defensive necessity consistent with international law, including the UN Charter's provisions on the use of force, and as a calculated warning to adversaries, primarily Israel and the United States, that future conflicts]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-announces-shift-to-preemptive-strikes-based-on-objective-signs-of-threat</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/iran-announces-shift-to-preemptive-strikes-based-on-objective-signs-of-threat</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:49:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Air France-KLM Flying Blue Credit Card Switches to Visa Signature With New Dining Bonus and Enhanced XP Earning]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Air France-KLM credit card, previously issued as a World Elite Mastercard, will transition to a Visa Signature card effective March 20, 2026. Current cardholders will receive a new account number and card. Recent updates, already implemented as of January 16, 2026, include a new 3x miles per dollar earning rate on dining purchases. Additionally, the card now offers improved Flying Blue XP (Experience Points) bonuses on the account anniversary: cardholders who spend $15,000–$24,999 in an anniversary year receive an extra 80 XP (totaling 100 XP including the base 20 XP), while those spending $25,000 or more earn an additional 60 XP (totaling 160 XP). The annual fee remains $89, and the base earning rate is unchanged at 1.5 miles per dollar on non-bonused purchases.

Announced during the fifth Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh, the move involves the state-owned Saudi Gold Refinery Company committing to immediate purchases of Sudanese bullion. This follows high-level meetings between Saudi and Sudanese ministers, including Bandar Alkhorayef and Nur Al Dayem Al Taha, and confirmation from refinery president Suleiman Bin Saleh Al Othaim. The effort is part of Riyadh's broader plan to diversify its economy away from hydrocarbons by tapping into African precious metals flows.

The probe, prompted by multiple complaints, revealed that Betar engaged in bias-motivated assaults, threats, and harassment targeting Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, and Jewish New Yorkers, particularly those involved in protests related to Israel and Palestine. Evidence included physical intimidation, assaults (such as striking a woman wearing a keffiyeh and celebrating it online), promoting violence by encouraging members to bring weapons to protests, circulating content celebrating violence against Palestinians, and attempting to intimidate protesters through actions like referencing deadly operations in Lebanon.

Originating from graffiti and street art – often created without permission and imbued with a rebellious spirit – these bold designs have infiltrated various areas of the design world. Initially seen on clothing and accessories, streetwear illustration now shapes graphic hoodies, jeans, and broader design trends, resonating strongly with younger audiences. 

The impact extends beyond aesthetics; streetwear illustration functions as a powerful visual language communicating cultural values, attitudes, and emotions. Designers are drawing inspiration from the bold typography, layering techniques, and symbolic representations commonly found in street art.

The promotion applies only to in-store purchases, as online orders are processed by a third party that does not qualify for office supply credit card rewards.

This offer has long been a favorite among points and miles enthusiasts. By purchasing three $200 Mastercard gift cards, customers spend $600, receive a $30 discount, and pay $23.85 in activation fees.

He stated that this snub relieves him of prioritizing peace and allows him to focus on U.S. interests, including demanding 'Complete and Total Control' of Greenland from Denmark. Anne Applebaum criticizes the letter for its poor grammar, factual inaccuracies—such as Trump's false claim of ending wars and denial of historical documents supporting Danish sovereignty over Greenland—and its bizarre obsession with the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Committee, independent of the Norwegian government, awards the prize, yet Trump blames Norway and links it to territorial ambitions.

Minaj accused Lemon of disrespecting Christianity by covering an anti-ICE protest that interrupted a church service in St. Paul, Minnesota. The demonstration at Cities Church targeted Pastor David Easterwood, who also serves as an acting field office director for ICE in the region. Protesters disrupted the service to demand accountability for the recent fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier in January, amid heightened immigration enforcement operations under the Trump administration. Minaj's post included a homophobic slur, referring to Lemon as 'DON ‘COCK SUCKIN’ LEMON IS DISGUSTING,' called him a 'thug,' and repeatedly demanded 'LOCK HIM UP!!!!!' while claiming he would not act similarly toward other religions.

Speaking on the sidelines of the African Union-European Union summit in Luanda, Angola, he emphasized the need for robust security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe to prevent Russia from renewing hostilities.

The mission concluded successfully despite a serious technical setback: cracks had appeared in the left window of the spacecraft’s return capsule. Initially, Shenzhou 20 had carried astronauts Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie to the Chinese Space Station (CSS). When damage was detected during pre-return inspections, Chinese mission control decided to bring the crew back earlier aboard Shenzhou 21 on November 14, 2025, following a record 204-day stay in orbit — the longest so far for Chinese astronauts.

The region's shift toward Trump was driven by frustrations with the economy, immigration policies under previous administrations, and dissatisfaction with Democrats. However, current challenges—including tariff changes, visa restrictions, slowed cross-border trade, and immigration enforcement actions—have led to lost shipments for customs brokers, labor shortages for builders and farmers, and fear among legal cross-border workers.

While acknowledging Ross’ name is public, Noem insisted it shouldn’t be repeated, a stance that drew pushback from Brennan and CBS staffers who questioned claims of internal bleeding. 

The incident follows a shooting on January 7th, where Ross fatally shot Renee Good while she was driving during an ICE protest.

Such actions by states would constitute acts of war, unlike piracy by non-state actors. The piece highlights historical parallels, like British seizures contributing to the War of 1812, and stresses that Russia has threatened retaliation, potentially by escorting ships with warships or seizing Western vessels. Given the Russian navy's limitations and the even weaker state of the Royal Navy, any independent European action is unlikely without full U.S. backing, which the Trump administration should withhold to avoid direct NATO-Russia confrontation.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned the tariffs as 'completely wrong,' stating they punish allies for collective NATO security efforts. He reiterated that Greenland belongs to Denmark and its people, while stressing Arctic security's importance against Russian threats.

Born in 1930 into poverty on a farm in segregated Virginia during the Jim Crow era, West overcame significant barriers through exceptional academic talent. She graduated first in her high school class, earning a scholarship to Virginia State College, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1952 and a master's in 1955.

In 1956, she joined the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia, becoming only the second African American woman hired there and one of just four Black employees at the time. Over her long career, West focused on complex mathematical modeling of Earth's shape, processing satellite data to create precise geodetic models essential for accurate satellite navigation.

Beginning as a modest riverside settlement known as Lutetia in 300 BCE along the Seine River, the city gradually expands into a major urban center. The timelapse illustrates pivotal historical developments, including the tightening of medieval walls that enclosed the early core, the dissolution of ancient fortifications into modern avenues, and the dramatic 19th-century redesign under Baron Haussmann, whose wide boulevards imposed geometric order on the medieval street layout. As centuries pass, new neighborhoods are absorbed, islands in the Seine become focal points of power, and peripheral areas evolve into central districts. The animation underscores the dynamic, layered nature of urban development, where each era contributes visible traces while the city continuously reinvents itself.

The protesters reportedly threw Molotov cocktails, chanted slogans, and forced their way into the residence, resulting in injuries to the ambassador and several embassy staff members. During the attack, the ambassador, her family, and some staff took refuge in the basement until Iranian security forces intervened and rescued them. Authorities confronted the protesters and managed to regain control of the situation. Extensive damage was reported at the residence as a result of the assault. Salam al-Zawawi, who has served as ambassador since January 2022, succeeded her father, Salah al-Zawawi, who held the same position from February 1981 until her appointment.

This shift is primarily attributed to persistently rising home prices combined with elevated mortgage rates, which have made homeownership less accessible, particularly for younger buyers. The data, sourced from the National Association of Realtors' Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, highlights how affordability challenges have delayed entry into the housing market for many, pushing the typical buyer age higher over recent years. In earlier decades, such as the early 1980s, homebuying was far more common among people in their early 30s, reflecting different economic conditions with lower relative housing costs and interest rates. The article includes a chart illustrating this long-term upward trend in median buyer age.

The award was presented by FIFA President Gianni Infantino during the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington DC in December 2025, where Infantino praised Trump for embodying hope, unity, and leadership. However, subsequent events have fueled criticism: the US conducted airstrikes in Venezuela, captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, and extradited them to face charges including narco-terrorism in the US. Trump has also made threats to invade Greenland, citing strategic needs. Initially, there was unease within FIFA about the opaque selection process and the political implications, particularly with the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the US, Canada, and Mexico. This has evolved into 'deep embarrassment,' with sources describing the upcoming tournament as a 'delicate' and 'difficult' pe]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fifa-officials-express-increasing-embarrassment-over-awarding-peace-prize-to-donald-trump</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/fifa-officials-express-increasing-embarrassment-over-awarding-peace-prize-to-donald-trump</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:09:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Four Potential Futures for American Federalism Amid Political Division]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article argues that the U.S. federal government has been captured by a minority coalition wielding disproportionate power through institutions like the Senate, Electoral College, and judiciary. Democratic-leaning states fund this system while seeing their tax dollars support policies in other states that suppress voting, reduce healthcare access, and entrench gerrymandering. The author describes the current situation as an unsustainable patchwork of soft resistance, with mounting pressure that could lead to breakdown. He outlines four plausible paths forward. First, soft secession: states quietly ignore federal mandates without formal declarations, withholding data, refusing enforcement, and building parallel systems like state-level social programs, potentially evolving into an EU-like structure with shared currency and defense but separate domestic policies. Second, oppositional federalism: more active resistance where states criminally charge federal officials, obstruct enforcem]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/four-potential-futures-for-american-federalism-amid-political-division</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/four-potential-futures-for-american-federalism-amid-political-division</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:04:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Essential Steps to Protect Your Health and Legal Rights After a Motorcycle Accident]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article provides detailed guidance for motorcycle riders on what to do immediately after a crash to safeguard their safety, health, and legal rights. It begins by emphasizing that safety should always come first. Riders are advised to move to a safe location, activate hazard lights, and call emergency services right away. Medical attention is crucial even for seemingly minor injuries, as symptoms may appear later. Accepting professional medical care also links injuries directly to the crash through official records, which become important for legal claims. The second key step involves consistent follow-up with doctors and therapists, keeping all related medical documents organized to demonstrate the seriousness of the situation. Gathering strong evidence is another central point in the article. It encourages taking photographs of the scene, collecting witness information, and documenting every detail while memory is fresh.

Viewed from above, it reveals its true scale and singularity, with minimal human intervention—no extensive roads or developments reshape the interior, allowing the wilderness to remain the primary force. Human presence is confined to small coastal towns with brightly colored homes clustered along icy harbors and cliffs, where life adapts to the rhythms of weather, seasons, and nature rather than modern haste. The light in Greenland behaves uniquely, softly illuminating snowfields, glowing on glaciers, and reflecting off the ocean, with extended summer daylight and expansive winter skies.

The main advantages include earning substantial credit card rewards that can offset or exceed processing fees (typically around 1.75–1.85%), meeting minimum spending requirements for valuable welcome bonuses on premium travel rewards cards, and accelerating progress toward large sign-up bonuses on cards like the American Express Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, or various airline/hotel co-branded cards.

The article lists 2026 tax payment deadlines for both annual filings (April 15, 2026) and quarterly estimated payments. It highlights cards offering high cash-back rates (up to 3% temporarily or 2.625% ongoing with certain Bank of America tiers) that can generate net profit after fees, as well as popular current welcome offers with bonuses ranging from 75,000 to 175,000 points/miles after meeting spend thresholds.

In his speech, he criticized federal authorities, including ICE, for using excessive force in American cities, calling for accountability and respect for civil rights. He introduced his 1978 song “The Promised Land” as an ode to American ideals and emphasized the current threat to these values.

The new setup introduces three cards—Blue, Obsidian, and Palladium—with the Palladium standing out for having a welcome bonus and 4% Bilt Cash back on purchases. However, customers must now perform complex calculations to determine how much to spend in order to earn points on their rent. Depending on the chosen earning option, rent rewards range from 0.5x to 1.25x—conditional on how much of your monthly housing cost you pay with Bilt. Unlike the original Bilt 1.0 model, users no longer earn easy 1x on rent after five transactions, drastically reducing the simplicity and appeal of the program. The article further criticizes the expiration policy of Bilt Cash, which vanishes at the end of the calendar year (except for $100 rollover), and the vague or limite]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-bilt-s-new-credit-cards-complicated-rewards-and-uncertain-value</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analysis-of-bilt-s-new-credit-cards-complicated-rewards-and-uncertain-value</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comparing Country Risk Through Fiscal and Economic Indicators]]></title><description><![CDATA[The article, published on January 19, 2026, on the blog 'La mirada del mendigo,' presents a thought experiment about sovereign debt and country risk.

Each country’s economic profile is summarized through key macroeconomic indicators: public debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal deficit, current account balance, and GDP growth. 

India (State A) shows moderate debt and deficit levels with solid GDP growth. France (State B) faces a high debt ratio and weak growth but maintains a balanced external account. Indonesia (State C) stands out for its low debt and strong economic expansion. The United States (State D) suffers from heavy debt and deficit though maintains stable growth.

The incident stems from Donald Trump's recent threat to impose tariffs on several European nations, including the UK, unless the US is permitted to purchase Greenland. Trump's demands, including a 10% tariff starting February 1st escalating to 25% in June, have been firmly rejected by European leaders, who maintain Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and its future is a matter for the Greenlanders and Danes.

The updated terms and conditions specify that certain transactions no longer qualify for earning Bilt Points or Bilt Cash. Notably, tax payments, person-to-person payments (such as Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle), and purchases from online resale marketplaces like eBay or Facebook Marketplace are now excluded from earning rewards. These exclusions mark a notable departure from standard credit card reward practices, especially since tax payments traditionally earn points on most other credit cards.

These properties attract guests who prioritize using points over seeking higher-quality stays, contrasting them with brands like Four Seasons that thrive without loyalty incentives.

On January 17, 2026, the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, topped with the Orion spacecraft named Integrity, was transported from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) High Bay 3 to Launch Pad 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center using the historic Crawler-Transporter 2 (CT-2). This slow journey, at a maximum speed of 1.3 km/h, covered 6.8 kilometers and lasted about 12 hours, from 12:04 UTC to 23:42 UTC. The CT-2, a relic from the Apollo era built in 1963 and later modified for SLS use, carried the Mobile Launcher 1 (ML-1) platform, which includes a 105-meter launch tower, bringing the total height to 116 meters and the unfueled mass to around 6,800 tons.

Despite Donald Trump’s claim that the movie premiere is a high-demand event, insiders told outlets like RadarOnline and Hollywood columnist Rob Shuter that ticket sales have been extremely weak. The $40 million Amazon/MGM-backed documentary, directed by Brett Ratner, was expected to attract strong interest by offering an inside look at Melania Trump’s life as First Lady and her relationship with Donald Trump. However, advance sales across key markets such as New York and Palm Beach have been disappointing, with theaters reportedly “practically empty.” Studios have even considered withholding official box office numbers if the turnout remains underwhelming. Although Trump publicly praised the film—calling it “incredible”—he admitted he had only seen parts of it, which sparked mockery on social media.

The piece portrays the unrest as a violent insurrection manipulated by foreign intelligence services and backed by exiled Iranian figures such as Reza Pahlavi, rather than as a grassroots movement. It alleges that Western media exaggerated the scale of the protests and ignored violent acts committed by demonstrators, such as attacks on police, mosques, and public buildings.

Unlike traditional tiny drones that struggle with stability, turbulence, and control at small scales, this robot uses flapping wings that beat hundreds of times per second, powered by artificial muscles. The key innovation is a bio-inspired, dual-layer AI-based control system functioning like an insect's nervous system, enabling real-time reactions to disturbances such as wind gusts and rapid directional changes. In demonstrations, the robot achieves speeds and accelerations dramatically higher than previous microrobots—up to 447% faster flight and 255% greater acceleration—while performing complex acrobatics, including continuous mid-air somersaults (10 flips in 11 seconds) and quick recovery to maintain precise trajectories within a few centimeters.

Trump announced on Saturday that starting February 1, 2026, a 10% tariff would apply to goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, and the United Kingdom, rising to 25% on June 1 and remaining in place until a deal is reached for the US to purchase Greenland. He justified this by claiming the US needs control over the Arctic territory to counter potential threats from China and Russia, while portraying the targeted nations' opposition—and their recent military activities in Greenland—as risky. In response, the eight affected countries issued a joint statement warning that such tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and lead to a 'dangerous downward spiral.'

Noem insisted her numbers were correct and promised to provide the 'correct numbers.' Immigration expert Aaron Reichlin-Melnick then highlighted ICE's own records, showing that 43% of detainees had no criminal record, 29% had one or more prior convictions (mostly traffic or immigration offenses), and 28% had pending charges. Reichlin-Melnick confirmed that Noem's claim was false.

This transaction marks the start of plans to offload up to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil seized following the U.S. military capture of President Nicolás Maduro earlier in January 2026, along with a naval embargo and efforts to attract Western investment in Venezuela's oil sector. A key figure in securing the deal was John Addison, a senior Vitol trader who attended a recent White House meeting with President Trump and other oil executives. Addison has donated roughly $6 million to political action committees supporting Trump's re-election, including $5 million to Maga Inc. in 2024.

The MDC, which also houses figures such as Sean 'Diddy' Combs, Sam Bankman-Fried, and 'El Chapo' Guzmán, has long faced severe criticism from defense lawyers and judges over unsanitary conditions, violence, and inmate suicides. Reports describe the jail as overcrowded, dirty, and plagued by drug use and lockdowns unrelated to COVID-19 restrictions.

Once a crypto-mining company, CoreWeave has become a key player in AI infrastructure by purchasing Nvidia chips, building data centers, and leasing computing power to major clients like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Nvidia itself. Despite strong stock performance post-IPO and major deals worth billions, the company reports $5 billion in expected revenue against $20 billion in spending, financed by $14 billion in high-interest debt—much of it from private-equity firms—and $34 billion in future lease obligations. The sector features intricate, interconnected arrangements: Nvidia invests in AI firms that buy its chips, while companies like OpenAI secure massive computing contracts and invest back into partners.

According to legend, San Marino was founded in 301 CE by Marinus, a Dalmatian stonemason who fled persecution under Emperor Diocletian and established a hermitage on Mount Titano. Although modern historians see this as likely myth, a real monastic community existed there by the mid-8th century, gradually evolving into an autonomous republic. By the 13th century, San Marino had developed its unique system of government led by two 'Captains Regent', a diarchy that still operates today. Throughout history, San Marino's survival depended on diplomacy and prudence rather than military might. The republic avoided absorption into surrounding territories by maintaining good relations with the Papacy, Napoleon, and later the Kingdom of Italy. During the Napoleonic and World Wars, it preserved neutrality and independence, even offering refuge to figures such as Giuseppe Garibaldi d]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-survival-of-san-marino-from-a-legend-to-a-modern-republic</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-historical-survival-of-san-marino-from-a-legend-to-a-modern-republic</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roman Coins Depicting Ancient Architectural Monuments and Their Historical Significance]]></title><description><![CDATA[This article by Dr. Steve Benner explores how Roman emperors and officials frequently featured monumental architecture on their coinage to commemorate constructions they sponsored or to promote their legacy.

The negative impact was more pronounced in regions with stricter lockdowns, suggesting a link to mental health challenges.

The ongoing special military operation is expected to intensify, with Russian forces advancing in Donetsk, Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, and Sumy regions, while Ukraine holds the front through European aid and expanded mobilization. Escalation risks include expanded proxy warfare, sabotage, and reprisals beyond Ukraine, though a large-scale direct Russia-Europe conflict remains unlikely.

Option 1 eliminates Bilt Cash earnings from everyday spend and ties housing rewards to non-housing credit card spend as a percentage of monthly housing costs: under 25% yields a flat 250 points, 25% earns 0.5x points on housing, 50% earns 0.75x, 75% earns 1x, and 100% or more earns 1.25x. Option 2 (referred to as Option B) allows cards to earn base points plus 4% back in Bilt Cash on spend, where every $3 in Bilt Cash unlocks 100 Bilt points on housing payments, with any excess Bilt Cash available for other redemptions.

Miller emphasized Greenland's strategic importance for U.S. national security in the Arctic, citing increasing competition from adversaries in polar regions for resources, navigation, and control. He described Greenland as significantly larger than Alaska and argued that Denmark, with its small economy and military, 'cannot defend' or 'control' the territory. Miller asserted that under 'every understanding of law' on territorial control for the past 500 years, a nation must defend, improve, and inhabit a territory to legitimately hold it, claiming Denmark fails these criteria.

He specifically criticized the use of terms like 'Nazi' and 'Gestapo' to describe political opponents and law enforcement, linking such language to recent violent incidents. Vance referenced a shooting earlier that day at an ICE facility in Dallas, Texas, where shooter Joshua Jahn killed one detainee, wounded two others, and then took his own life, leaving 'Anti-ICE' markings. He argued that demonizing ICE and labeling conservatives as Nazis contributes to an escalating 'assassination culture.' The context includes the September 10 assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, the June fatal shooting of Democratic Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, and prior assassination attempts on Donald Trump in 2024.

This marks the first time a high-ranking official has publicly acknowledged the scale of desertions in the Ukrainian armed forces. Desertion rates have risen sharply over the past few years, with 9,137 cases in 2022 and 24,286 in 2023, representing a tenfold increase in just two years. From January to October of last year, more than 176,000 cases of draft evasion were recorded, though statistics were later discontinued. Monthly desertion rates peaked at 19,600 in October. Under current Ukrainian law, men aged 18 to 60 must register for military service and carry documentation, while those aged 25 to 60 are subject to mobilization. Martial law restricts men aged 23 to 60 from leaving the country, yet tens of thousands have fled illegally.

A CNN/SSRS poll shows his overall job approval at 39%, down from 48% earlier, with nearly 60% viewing his first year as a failure. On the economy, 55% say his policies have worsened conditions, while only 36% approve of his priorities—a notable decline from prior surveys. Voters also express concerns about excessive use of presidential power. An AP-NORC poll highlights erosion even among Republicans, with sharp drops in positive views on cost-of-living help (from 49% to 16% saying 'a lot') and immigration approval (from 88% to 76% among GOP). Overall, 38% approve of his immigration handling versus 61% disapproval, marking lows on economic management. Reuters/Ipsos reports 58% disapproval overall and strong opposition to foreign military ideas, like against Greenland (71% say bad idea).

He argues that AI is being used as a scapegoat for these decisions, while leaders secure bonuses despite overpromising. Yap also condemns the focus on minimum viable products and lowering quality standards to maximize short-term gains, which exploits users and degrades product experiences, ultimately harming innovation and society.

Anderson has consistently criticized the series for exploiting her and her former husband Tommy Lee’s private and traumatic experiences, demanding a public apology from Rogen. She described the situation as ‘yucky’ and expressed feeling like she was being overlooked, highlighting the lingering impact the series has had on her.

This application generates interactive digital maps populated with potential deportation targets, displaying clusters of individuals flagged for possible detention. When an agent selects a person on the map, the tool presents a detailed dossier including the individual's name, photograph, date of birth, Alien Registration Number, and other personal data. Crucially, it assigns a 'confidence score' (out of 100) indicating the system's estimated reliability that the person currently resides at the listed address.

This sprawling tent-based center, built on Fort Bliss military base and operated by private contractor Acquisition Logistics LLC, has faced scrutiny over conditions during heightened immigration enforcement efforts.

ICE initially reported that Lunas Campos became disruptive while in line for medication, refused to return to his dorm, and was moved to segregation. There, staff observed him in distress, initiated lifesaving measures, and called emergency services after he reportedly attempted suicide. The Department of Homeland Security later stated he violently resisted staff during the struggle and stopped breathing.

The first incident involved a Long March 3B/E (CZ-3B/G2) rocket lifting off from Xichang's LC-3 pad at 04:08 UTC on January 16 (local time January 17 in Beijing), carrying the Shijian-32 satellite—likely a military or technology demonstration payload destined for geostationary orbit. A problem with the cryogenic third stage, powered by YF-75 engines, resulted in the complete loss of the mission, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended orbit. This was notable as the CZ-3B family, a veteran launcher from CALT with 175 missions since 1984, had only experienced four prior failures (one total in 1996, and others partial or total mostly tied to the third stage).

Other nations, including the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and Sweden, are participating in this coordinated effort led from Copenhagen, outside formal NATO structures. The moves follow unsuccessful talks between Denmark, Greenland, and the U.S., where President Trump has pushed for U.S. control or acquisition of Greenland citing strategic needs, resources, and threats from Russia and China.

The rocket carried a capsule containing microgravity experiments, including rose seeds, which reached an apogee of approximately 120 kilometers, crossing the Kármán line into space. The capsule separated from the rocket 104 seconds after launch at around 75 kilometers in altitude, deployed a parachute at roughly 70 kilometers, and landed 170 kilometers west of the launch site. The mission provided about five minutes of microgravity for the experiments. The Lihong 1 is a single-stage, solid-fuel rocket with a launch mass of 7 tons and a thrust of 156 kilonewtons, capable of reaching up to 200 kilometers.

Between 2002 and 2024, 75% of the 5.2 million new workers entering Spain’s labour market were foreign nationals or dual citizens. 

Over the past two decades, Spain has focused on integrating migrants through flexible regularisation mechanisms rather than punitive approaches.

The bunker, originally designed to protect local dignitaries and essential personnel in the event of a nuclear attack, has been largely abandoned for decades. Recent severe storms and persistent coastal erosion have dramatically accelerated the deterioration of the cliff face, leaving the bunker exposed and vulnerable. Local authorities and conservation groups are scrambling to assess the situation, but relocation or stabilization of the bunker appears impossible given its fragile location.

Through these images, Sicily emerges as a place defined by symmetry, texture, and repetition. Narrow streets form intricate geometric patterns, while tightly clustered buildings suggest communities shaped by history, climate, and tradition.

He emphasized that Moscow is closely monitoring developments surrounding the island, describing the current situation as 'very controversial,' 'unusual,' and even 'extraordinary' from the perspective of international law. Peskov noted statements from Denmark and Greenland rejecting any intention to sell the territory, while acknowledging reports of a US monetary offer to acquire Greenland in some form. This comes amid renewed US interest under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed a desire to control Greenland for strategic reasons, citing its location, mineral resources, and concerns over potential Russian and Chinese activities in the Arctic—claims he has used to justify possible acquisition, without ruling out military means.

According to The Verge, Grok has been allowing users to generate AI-altered images that undress women and even apparent minors — a feature that has sparked outrage among policymakers around the world. Many governments have announced investigations, asserting that such technology should be regulated under existing and future laws designed to protect individuals from generative AI abuse. 

St. Clair’s suit, filed in New York State and later moved to federal court, claims that xAI’s product is “unreasonably dangerous as designed” and argues that the company has created a public nuisance. Her legal team, led by attorney Carrie Goldberg, contends that Section 230 — the U.S. law shielding internet platforms from liability for user-generated content — should not apply in this case because the offensive mat]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ashley-st-clair-sues-xai-over-grok-s-creation-of-ai-deepfakes-without-consent</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/ashley-st-clair-sues-xai-over-grok-s-creation-of-ai-deepfakes-without-consent</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper Rejects Direct Talks with Putin, Citing Lack of Evidence for Peace Intentions, Differing from France and Italy]]></title><description><![CDATA[The United Kingdom has publicly diverged from France and Italy on the issue of resuming direct diplomatic engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to address the ongoing war in Ukraine. In an interview with POLITICO, UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized that any re-engagement must be preceded by clear evidence that Moscow genuinely seeks peace, which she stated is currently absent. Cooper rejected proposals from Paris and Rome advocating for renewed dialogue as part of efforts to end the conflict. She highlighted the ongoing collaborative work between Ukraine, the United States, and European supporters to develop peace plans, including robust security guarantees for Kyiv. According to Cooper, the diplomatic focus should remain on these initiatives rather than direct talks with Putin, given the lack of willingness from Russia to negotiate seriously.

The poll indicates that many people worldwide now view China as the rising power, with majorities in countries such as the United States (54%), the European Union (53%), India (51%), and Brazil (72%) expecting China to exert greater global influence in the coming decade. In contrast, fewer respondents anticipate the United States gaining more influence, and perceptions of the US as a reliable ally have declined in several nations, including the UK (25%) and EU countries (16%). The survey attributes this shift to Trump's 'America First' policies, including high tariffs on allies and adversaries, skepticism toward traditional alliances, and tensions with partners like Ukraine and European nations.

This initiative, part of renewed efforts to complete a long-delayed free trade agreement (FTA), aims to introduce a two-way labour mobility scheme between Australia and the EU’s 27 member states. Under the proposed plan, Australians would be able to live and work in European countries such as France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain for up to four years without needing to secure a job in advance. In return, EU citizens would be granted similar rights to live and work in Australia. The scheme seeks to ease labour shortages on both sides while fostering stronger social and economic ties. If approved, it would replace existing working holiday visa agreements that currently restrict how long Australians can reside and work in Europe and potentially open the door to more permanent settlement options.]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-proposes-mutual-visa-free-work-and-residence-scheme-with-australia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/eu-proposes-mutual-visa-free-work-and-residence-scheme-with-australia</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 09:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China-linked Hacker Arrested in Italy for U.S. Cyberattack Allegations]]></title><description><![CDATA[In early July of the previous year, Italian authorities detained a 33-year-old Chinese citizen at Milan airport following an international arrest warrant issued by the United States.

However, the initial rollout caused significant confusion among users, prompting founder Ankur Jain to issue an update via email just days later. This update adds a second earning track for housing payments (rent or mortgage), allowing cardholders to choose between two options while keeping core card benefits unchanged. Option 1, described as 'simpler' and fee-free, lets users earn points directly on housing payments with multipliers ranging from 0.5x to 1.25x based on everyday non-housing credit card spend as a percentage of the monthly housing amount. For example, spending at least 100% of the housing payment on everyday purchases earns 1.25x points on the housing amount, with a minimum of 250 points if thresholds aren't met. This option eliminates Bilt Cash earnings on spend and removes the previous 100]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bilt-introduces-additional-option-for-earning-points-on-rent-and-mortgage-payments-amid-program-changes</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/bilt-introduces-additional-option-for-earning-points-on-rent-and-mortgage-payments-amid-program-changes</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 06:31:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The History and Cultural Impact of the Bullet Bra in Mid-20th Century Fashion]]></title><description><![CDATA[During the late 1940s and 1950s, women’s fashion emphasized structure, shape, and highly stylized silhouettes, with undergarments serving as essential tools for achieving the desired body form. The bullet bra emerged as one of the most iconic and visually striking garments of this period. Designed with stiff, conical cups reinforced with spiral stitching, it projected the bust sharply outward, creating a dramatic hourglass figure. The style reflected post-World War II societal expectations, where women were encouraged to embrace traditional femininity after participating in industrial and military roles during the war. Advertisements often used military terminology, such as 'bullet' and 'torpedo,' to highlight precision and projection. Hollywood and popular media helped normalize the pointed silhouette through pin-up models and actresses, giving rise to the famous 'sweater girl' look.

The program introduces two separate rewards currencies: traditional Bilt points (transferable to airline and hotel partners) and a new Bilt Cash option, with the latter replacing previous Milestone Rewards starting January 1, 2026, and raising questions about its overall value and redemption flexibility. Key points include the potential rewards from housing payments (rent and now expanded to mortgages), though earning rules require meeting activity thresholds like five transactions per statement period.

Rather than following straight paths, water routes allow access to hidden inlets, quiet coves, and remote shorelines that roads cannot reach, fostering a deeper connection to the landscape. The article explores three main types of water travel: lakes, which provide a grounding, circular exploration with opportunities for anchoring, swimming, and enjoying serene, mirrored sunsets amid pine-lined shores; rivers, which create a narrative of continuous motion with ever-changing bends, wildlife corridors, and earned progress measured by flow rather than distance; and coasts, which involve an outward sense of adventure with open horizons, variable weather, harbor hops, and awareness of tides and swells.

Far from being accidental, they were tolerated, regulated, and monitored by the state. The Lupanar in Pompeii, with its explicit frescoes and graffiti, reveals everyday life, including prices, boasts, insults, and even political comments, where soldiers, officials, and slaves mingled anonymously. The Subura neighborhood in Rome mixed senators, prostitutes, and politicians, serving as an unfiltered source of rumors about debts, bribes, and shifting allegiances—close enough to the Forum to function as a political barometer. Prostitution was legalized and taxed; women had to register with authorities, obtaining a 'licentia stupri,' and records were sometimes used for political leverage by emperors. Pimps often acted as informal informants, trading silence or rumors. The infamous Valeria Mesalina, wife of Emperor Claudius, allegedly used sex to build networks, eliminate rivals]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-brothels-in-imperial-rome-a-source-of-information-corruption-and-political-control</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/the-role-of-brothels-in-imperial-rome-a-source-of-information-corruption-and-political-control</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 05:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Australian company sues Greenland over rare earth mining rights at Kvanefjeld]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Australian mining company Energy Transition Minerals (ETM) has filed a lawsuit against Greenland, seeking compensation of over 11.5 billion US dollars for being denied the right to exploit the Kvanefjeld deposit, one of the world’s largest sources of rare earths, uranium, and thorium. The company initially received exploration approval almost two decades ago but was blocked after Greenland’s pro-indigenous party, Inuit Ataqatigiit, won local elections in 2021 and banned uranium mining due to environmental and health risks. The dispute has taken on geopolitical importance as ETM has hired Ballard Partners, a lobbying firm with close ties to former U.S. President Donald Trump, to advocate for its interests.

He called the event 'incredibly alarming' and said it left many citizens feeling uneasy about how such incidents are managed. Damon shared that several of his friends in law enforcement expressed concern as well, noting they would have handled the confrontation differently. 

Damon went on to compare the masked and theatrical approach used by some officers to the feeling of 'brown shirts,' a historical reference to the paramilitary groups that enforced authoritarian control in pre-war Germany. He warned that such dramatic and intimidating displays appear intentional and could signify a troubling shift in enforcement culture.

This small tempera and oil on panel work depicts Saint Anthony the Great levitating and tormented by demons, based closely on a 15th-century engraving by Martin Schongauer. Michelangelo enhanced the original with realistic details, such as fish scales on demons studied from a market, a added landscape resembling the Arno Valley, and compositional refinements for greater impact.

For centuries, its attribution to Michelangelo was debated, as he primarily identified as a sculptor and disparaged oil painting later in life. The painting sold at Sotheby's in 2008, initially under a workshop attribution.

This machinery operates both in the metropolitan center and in satellite countries, which he refers to using the Latin term 'civitas stipendaria' (tributary or stipend-paying states). Assange, presented as one of the most informed individuals on the hidden workings of states behind the public facade constructed by media, offers this as a masterful insight into how media and political systems intertwine to support imperial power, often in the context of wars and global dominance.

The soldiers loaded the animals onto trucks that seemed pre-arranged and initially transported them into Israeli-controlled territory. Subsequently, the goats were moved to farms associated with illegal Israeli outposts in the occupied West Bank. The incident came to light when farmers in the occupied Golan Heights observed dozens of the animals wandering freely on streets the following morning, leading to an army investigation.

Contrary to predictions from officials like Stephen Miller, reducing the number of foreign-born workers did not lead to improved labor market outcomes for U.S.-born individuals. Data reveals a significant decline of 881,000 foreign-born workers since January 2025, and 1.3 million since March 2025, creating a substantial gap compared to projections by the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Administration. This shortfall, alongside a drop in labor force participation among U.S.-born workers (from 61.4% to 61.2%), paints a picture of a labor market struggling to adjust.

On February 8, 1904, Japan launched a surprise attack on the Russian naval base at Port Arthur, triggering a war that left hundreds of thousands dead before ending with Japan’s victory in 1905. This triumph positioned Japan as the first modern Asian power to defeat a European empire and influenced both nations’ subsequent political and social developments. 

The piece highlights how millions of postcards depicting key events—naval battles, national personifications, and satirical scenes—became powerful tools of wartime communication and propaganda. These postcards, often printed in multiple languages, circulated internationally and helped shape public perceptions of the conflict.

The decision came after Stern, 68, was charged with a misdemeanor count of soliciting prostitution in Ventura County, California. According to prosecutors, the alleged incident occurred on December 10, 2025, at a hotel in Camarillo. His arraignment is scheduled for February 6. Before the charges became public, Stern was set to portray the father figure in ABC’s single-camera comedy exploring two versions of a couple’s life—one with a child and one without—starring Rachel Bloom and Rory Scovel. The network has announced plans to recast his role, while Stern’s representatives have declined to issue a public response.

The report details that ICE agents allegedly assaulted Arnulfo Bazan Carrillo, an undocumented man, and his 16-year-old son, Arnoldo Bazan, during a traffic stop after they were pulled over while getting food at McDonald’s. According to Arnoldo, he was placed in a chokehold despite identifying himself as a U.S. citizen and a minor. He claimed he struggled to breathe and feared for his life. 

Following the incident, ICE agents reportedly confiscated the teenager’s phone, which later appeared via the Find My feature in a vending machine for used electronics located near an ICE detention center. This detail strongly suggests that someone sold the confiscated phone. The ProPublica report further documents over forty cases in which ICE agents allegedly used dangerous restraint techniques such as chokeholds on civilians.

The delivered equipment includes Kalashnikov rifles and operational support gear, accompanied by Russian instructors responsible for training the Malagasy contingents in proper usage, maintenance, and tactical integration. Authorities emphasize that the acquisition of equipment alone is insufficient without comprehensive technical and operational knowledge.

These small, high-turnover products often suffer from issues like disconnected sales platforms (e.g., Shopify, Amazon, eBay), outdated systems, and human errors due to similar packaging or identical shells differentiated only by minor model numbers. Fast-moving categories like Canadian vaporizers add complexity with regulations, batch tracking, expiry dates, and storage requirements. Common problems include stockouts from delayed syncs, high return rates in consumer electronics, potential counterfeits slipping into stock, and costly write-offs—nearly 40% of small to mid-sized brands reported losses over $50,000 in a 2023 SupplyChainDive survey due to poor tracking.

Speaking at a Thursday press briefing, Leavitt stated that the president was 'simply joking' and that his remarks were meant to be taken facetiously. According to her explanation, Trump was emphasizing his administration’s successes and implying humorously that such achievements made elections seem unnecessary, but not seriously proposing any change to the constitutional electoral process. 

Trump’s comments were made in a Reuters interview the previous day, during which he discussed a long-standing political observation that the party holding the presidency often suffers losses in midterm elections. He expressed frustration with this trend, claiming it was 'some deep psychological thing,' before saying, 'when you think of it, we shouldn’t even have an election.'

The company promoted the switch as a seamless process, allowing existing cardholders to upgrade without a hard credit inquiry, retain their card numbers, and transfer any balances. However, numerous reports from users across forums, Reddit, Facebook groups, and blog comments indicate significant friction. Key problems include dramatic reductions in credit limits, repeated error messages during the process, and—most concerning—outright denials for approval on the new Cardless products despite being current, in-good-standing Bilt cardholders. Denials appear to fall into categories such as ID verification failures (similar to past issues seen with other fintech-issued cards) and standard rejections with promises of follow-up letters.

Publicado en 'Scientific Reports', este avance permite detectar cambios en los patrones sísmicos del magma, lo que indica que se ha iniciado su ascenso hacia la superficie. Según los científicos, el magma sigue una 'memoria' que permanece estable mientras se encuentra estancado; cuando se produce un cambio en esa sismicidad, la erupción es inminente. Este sistema no solo avisa del inicio de la erupción, sino que también puede identificar cuándo el volcán comienza a perder fuerza, facilitando la planificación del retorno de la población evacuada y la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas.

De este modo se evitan los trayectos terrestres más peligrosos, plagados de minas, artillería, barro y detección enemiga, que causan numerosas bajas.

Esta innovación, descrita por mandos ucranianos y confirmada por la empresa Ark Robotics (que suministra robots a más de 20 brigadas), ha sorprendido incluso a sus propios fabricantes.

A través del personaje de Enrique, elevado a héroe por una sociedad hedonista y decadente, la obra retrata el ascenso y la caída de unos valores colectivos basados en la competición, la idolatría y la obediencia acrítica. El deporte aparece simbolizado como una “cucaña” que promete éxito y gloria, pero que acaba revelando el vacío moral y humano que sostiene ese ideal.

La reseña subraya el carácter despiadado de la crítica social que recorre toda la pieza. García Calvo ridiculiza las pasiones de un pueblo entendido como masa, capaz de emocionarse con gestas deportivas mientras acepta sin cuestionamiento una estructura social grotesca, estatista y deshumanizada.

La acusación principal es que el banco canceló unilateralmente varias cuentas bancarias de Trump por motivos políticos, tras el asalto al Capitolio del 6 de enero de 2021, cuando Trump alentó a sus seguidores a impedir la certificación de la victoria electoral de Joe Biden.

A través de varias publicaciones en Truth Social, Trump acusó a grandes medios de comunicación y empresas de encuestas de publicar resultados sesgados para perjudicar su presidencia. En concreto, criticó la encuesta conjunta del New York Times y el Siena College Research Institute, afirmando que estaba inclinada a favor de los demócratas y anunciando acciones legales para exigir que se conserven los registros internos de la encuesta. Según estas encuestas recientes, su aprobación se encuentra en torno al 35-40%, con un desaprobación superior al 60%, reflejando un debilitamiento notable incluso en áreas donde Trump solía mostrar fortaleza, como economía, inmigración y seguridad fronteriza. Trump argumenta que existen encuestas favorables a su gestión que no se publican y que los medios utilizan los sondeos como herramienta política]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cuestiona-encuestas-desfavorables-tras-registrar-su-menor-aprobacion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-cuestiona-encuestas-desfavorables-tras-registrar-su-menor-aprobacion</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maria Machado propone intervenciones militares en Cuba y Nicaragua tras el caso de Venezuela, desatando críticas en redes]]></title><description><![CDATA[Maria Corina Machado, galardonada con el Premio Nobel de la Paz en 2025 y líder de la oposición venezolana, ha generado una fuerte polémica tras declarar públicamente que Estados Unidos debería intervenir militarmente en Cuba y Nicaragua de forma similar a la reciente operación en Venezuela, donde se capturó al presidente Nicolás Maduro y su esposa. Durante su visita a Washington y reuniones con legisladores estadounidenses, Machado defendió que la liberación de Venezuela era solo el primer paso hacia la eliminación del comunismo y la dictadura en América Latina. Sus comentarios provocaron críticas inmediatas en redes sociales, donde muchos usuarios la calificaron de hipócrita y cuestionaron su idoneidad para recibir el Nobel de la Paz. Algunos la acusaron de fomentar el belicismo y de confundir la libertad con la justificación de intervenciones militares.

Tras las denuncias de varios opositores, que alertaron de un número excepcionalmente alto de notas sobresalientes pese a la dificultad percibida de las pruebas, el Ministerio inició una investigación interna que incluyó entrevistas, análisis de documentación y revisión de procedimientos. Como resultado, se constataron indicios de hechos que podrían constituir varios delitos, lo que motivó el traslado del caso a la Fiscalía y a la Policía Judicial para una investigación más exhaustiva con los medios adecuados.

En una entrevista con el editor jefe de Bloomberg News, Milei subrayó que el peso de China en la economía global hace inevitable el comercio con Pekín, incluso mientras su Gobierno busca avanzar hacia un acuerdo de libre comercio con Washington.

Las declaraciones se produjeron minutos después de que Milei participara en un evento junto al presidente estadounidense, Donald Trump, reforzando la imagen de equilibrio que intenta proyectar entre ambas potencias.

El acto tuvo lugar en el Kennedy Center durante una fiesta organizada por Republicans for National Renewal, un grupo de derecha que promueve la posibilidad de que Donald Trump aspire a un tercer mandato presidencial, algo que actualmente sería inconstitucional. El pastel fue presentado de forma irónica como el “estado número 51”, en clara alusión a la reiterada propuesta de Trump de adquirir la isla ártica.

Al encuentro asistieron varios legisladores republicanos, entre ellos Anna Paulina Luna, Abe Hamadeh y Andy Ogles. Luna fue quien cortó la primera porción del pastel, mientras algunos asistentes advertían en tono jocoso de que el gesto podía provocar un escándalo internacional.

El autor descarta excusas indulgentes y apunta a una ejecución deficiente de la soldadura o problemas en el proceso de laminado del raíl. Sin embargo, enfatiza que este incidente no es aislado, sino que revela un problema más profundo y estructural en la red de alta velocidad española. Las vías, diseñadas originalmente para cargas y tráfico menores, están soportando actualmente un volumen muy superior al previsto, agravado por trenes pesados como el Frecciarossa (modelo ETR 1000 operado por Iryo), que contribuyen a un desgaste acelerado.

Reich considera que estas acciones se realizan en nombre de la ciudadanía estadounidense, con sus impuestos y, aparentemente, con su pasividad.

Ante la negativa de la Fiscalía a incorporar como prueba mensajes de WhatsApp que, según él, desmienten las acusaciones, ha decidido publicar capturas de dichas conversaciones en su cuenta de Instagram. El objetivo es demostrar la supuesta falsedad de las denuncias y mostrar una relación cordial con las exempleadas durante y después de su empleo.

Sin embargo, esta acción podría acarrearle consecuencias legales. La Constitución Española protege el secreto de las comunicaciones (artículo 18), y el artículo 197 del Código Penal tipifica como delito la revelación de secretos o la vulneración de la intimidad sin consentimiento, especialmente si afecta al honor, la reputación o la imagen, con penas que pueden incluir prisión de tres meses a un año o multas.

La especulación surgió tras la planificación de un aumento de aranceles a productos de ocho países europeos, lo que podría haber llevado a Europa a vender billones en bonos y acciones estadounidenses. Esto podría afectar a los mercados financieros, ya tensionados por las intenciones de Trump sobre la isla ártica.

Según la sentencia, la víctima fue llevada al piso tras pasar la tarde bebiendo alcohol y consumiendo marihuana, donde se le obligó a mantener relaciones sexuales mientras se encontraba en estado de confusión y aturdimiento. Para justificar estas agresiones, los condenados alegaron un supuesto ritual de curación para “sacar el demonio” que la joven llevaba dentro. Varios de los actos fueron grabados con el móvil de uno de los agresores y descubiertos por la Policía Nacional durante la desarticulación de la banda en 2021.

Comunicados oficiales, declaraciones de dirigentes y jugadores, y decisiones como la presencia en actos de la Diada o el Concert per la Llibertat muestran una estrategia clara basada en valores democráticos y diálogo. El conflicto político se intensificó en 2017 con el referéndum del 1 de octubre y la declaración unilateral de independencia, momento en el que el Barça aumentó la intensidad de sus pronunciamientos públicos, condenando la violencia policial y defendiendo espacios de expresión política como el Cam]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fc-barcelona-y-su-papel-durante-el-proces-catalan-2012-2017</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-fc-barcelona-y-su-papel-durante-el-proces-catalan-2012-2017</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Desprendimiento de tierra en Mount Maunganui sepulta parte de un camping en Nueva Zelanda y deja varios desaparecidos, incluidos menores]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un masivo desprendimiento de tierra, causado por lluvias torrenciales históricas en la Isla Norte de Nueva Zelanda, arrasó durante la madrugada del 22 de enero de 2026 parte del camping Mount Maunganui Beachside Holiday Park, en la zona de Mount Maunganui (Mauao). El deslizamiento destruyó caravanas, tiendas de campaña, vehículos y el bloque de baños y duchas, sepultando estructuras bajo toneladas de lodo, árboles y escombros. Varios campistas, entre ellos niños de vacaciones con sus familias, quedaron desaparecidos, con un número confirmado en un solo dígito según las autoridades. Testigos describen escenas de pánico y destacan la actuación heroica de una mujer que, sobre las cinco de la mañana, recorrió el camping alertando a los ocupantes golpeando puertas para que evacuaran ante el riesgo inminente; lamentablemente, ella misma quedó atrapada en el edificio de servicios que fue destruido.

El Tribunal de Justicia de la Unión Europea (TJUE) condenó a España por incumplir la Directiva de aguas residuales urbanas, señalando 12 puntos críticos en Tenerife de un total de 29 a nivel nacional, con deficiencias en colectores, tratamiento y control. Aunque la sentencia de diciembre de 2025 no impone sanción inmediata, abre la posibilidad de multas si no se corrigen los problemas de forma urgente. Datos del Gobierno de Canarias de 2025 registran 403 puntos de vertidos, más del 50% sin autorización, concentrándose principalmente en Tenerife. Algunos episodios recientes, como el cierre casi un año de Playa Jardín por altos niveles de E. coli, reflejan la magnitud del problema.

En un caso, una agente fue acorralada en la carretera y su teléfono derribado mientras intentaba grabar el incidente. Bruley subrayó que estas prácticas no son aisladas, y que otros jefes policiales han reportado situaciones similares con sus oficiales. Aunque se opone a la abolición del ICE, critica la manera en que se está llevando a cabo la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, que incluye detenciones sin causa aparente y exigencia de documentación a ciudadanos estadounidenses.

Según el documento, basado en entrevistas con economistas internos, el profesor del MIT Daron Acemoglu y expertos en infraestructura, las enormes inversiones (estimadas en torno al billón de dólares en capex por parte de gigantes tecnológicos y otras empresas) no han mostrado hasta ahora resultados proporcionales. El banco se pregunta si este gasto masivo llegará a compensarse con beneficios reales en productividad y rentabilidad.

El informe destaca que la euforia actual en torno a la IA está impulsando subidas en bolsa de empresas como Nvidia y otras del S&P 500, pero estas alzas ya incorporan expectativas muy optimistas de aumento de productividad (lo que implicaría automatización, despidos y reducción de costes laborales).

Esta hazaña fue especialmente complicada debido a las duras condiciones del rally, con tramos muy pedregosos que provocaron múltiples pinchazos en los neumáticos, llegando casi a agotar las seis ruedas de repuesto disponibles. A pesar de estos contratiempos, el camión demostró una gran fiabilidad mecánica y el equipo consiguió la medalla de finishers.

Hubo un 47 % más de vendedores que de compradores activos, lo que equivale a aproximadamente 631.000 vendedores adicionales sin demanda suficiente. El número de compradores activos cayó hasta un mínimo histórico de 1,34 millones, el nivel más bajo desde abril de 2020, al inicio de la pandemia.

Este cambio drástico se debe a varios factores: los precios de las viviendas siguen siendo muy elevados, las tasas hipotecarias continúan altas (alrededor del 6 %), despidos laborales, e incertidumbre económica y política. Esto contrasta con el mercado de 2021, cuando los compradores superaban ampliamente a los vendedores y se producían guerras de ofertas. El mercado se equilibró en febrero de 2024, pero desde entonces los vendedores han dominado claramente.

Según la directora del colegio, los agentes utilizaron al menor como cebo para entrar en la vivienda y verificar la presencia de otros adultos. Este tipo de actuaciones se basa en un nuevo memorando interno del ICE que permite a los agentes ingresar en domicilios sin orden judicial, amparándose en órdenes administrativas para arrestar a personas con orden final de deportación.

Según Fesser, Trump actúa como un 'gángster internacional' y solo llega hasta donde Europa esté dispuesta a permitirlo. Considera que la mejor respuesta es tratar a Estados Unidos como un adversario y plantarle cara de forma unida.

Explica que históricamente EE.UU. ha sido el garante de la seguridad para el libre comercio mundial, a cambio de que otros países invirtieran en su economía. Esto ha beneficiado a Washington, pero también ha creado una dependencia: la economía estadounidense necesita compradores exteriores para sostenerse.

Sin mencionar directamente a Donald Trump, Carney criticó cómo las grandes potencias utilizan la integración económica como arma de coerción, aranceles y control de cadenas de suministro para imponer sus intereses, dejando a las potencias medianas en posición de debilidad si negocian por separado.

Inspirándose en un ensayo de Václav Havel sobre vivir en la mentira, Carney afirmó que ya no se debe fingir que el viejo sistema funciona y que la nostalgia no es estrategia. Propuso que países como Canadá, la Unión Europea y el Reino Unido creen una 'tercera vía' mediante alianzas cooperativas basadas en valores compartidos y legitimidad, en lugar de someterse a la subordinación.

Según el sindicato, el Consistorio ha alterado los denominados “canales de firma” para que los directores generales, cargos de libre designación nombrados por el gobierno municipal, actúen de facto como jefes de servicio y validen decisiones de carácter político y económico.

UGT sostiene que este sistema permite que los directores generales autoricen aprobaciones de gasto, validaciones de facturas y otros actos administrativos sin el informe previo de los jefes de servicio funcionarios, lo que, a su juicio, vulnera la legalidad vigente.

Además de los potentes saques de Opelka, que llegó a sumar 37 aces, Davidovich tuvo que lidiar con la actitud de un pequeño grupo de espectadores irrespetuosos. Durante el tie-break del segundo set, un aficionado comenzó a gritar “¡U-S-A!”, provocando que el malagueño respondiera visiblemente enfadado. Más adelante, en el cuarto set, se encaró con otro grupo que le estaba insultando y mostrando gestos ofensivos, lo que llevó a Davidovich a alertar al supervisor del partido para que tomara medidas.

El animal sobrevivió al siniestro, donde su dueña Ana resultó con heridas leves y su hermana, embarazada, permanece ingresada en observación en el Hospital Reina Sofía. Tras el choque, Boro fue visto cerca de las vías, pero huyó asustado, lo que desencadenó una intensa búsqueda en un terreno abrupto, con lluvias, barro y temperaturas bajo cero. Voluntarios de toda España, asociaciones como TAU y Pacma, drones y efectivos de Infoca participaron en el operativo, que movilizó a cerca de 200 personas.

En apenas dos décadas, el país ha pasado de un sistema ferroviario saturado y precario a la red de alta velocidad más extensa del mundo, con más de 50.000 kilómetros en servicio y planes para alcanzar los 70.000 en 2035, conectando todas las ciudades de más de medio millón de habitantes. Este despliegue ha transformado la movilidad interna, reducido distancias y reforzado la cohesión social entre regiones muy dispares.

El único episodio grave que puso en cuestión este modelo fue el accidente de Wenzhou en 2011, cuando un tren detenido por un fallo eléctrico fue embestido por otro en un viaducto, provocando la caída de varios vagones, 40 muertos y más de 200 heridos. El suceso supuso un duro golpe para la confianza ciudadana en el medio de transporte más utilizado del país y obligó al Gobierno a reaccionar con medidas inmediatas y excepcionales.

En lugar de destruirse, los aviones quedaron encastrados uno sobre otro debido a la combinación de fuselaje de acero, madera y tela dopada, creando una estructura inesperadamente estable. Tras el impacto, los navegantes del avión inferior saltaron en paracaídas por precaución, mientras que Leonard Graham Fuller, piloto del avión superior, mantuvo el control utilizando los alerones y flaps de su avión junto con la propulsión de los motores del avión inferior. Fuller logró realizar un descenso controlado de casi diez minutos y aterrizó de panza sobre un prado despejado, salvando ambos aparatos.

Ni el presidente ni ninguna agencia federal tienen autoridad directa sobre los miles de funcionarios y cargos electos locales y estatales que gestionan el proceso.

Aunque la Casa Blanca podría intentar tácticas de intimidación (despliegue de ICE, Guardia Nacional, etc.), el tamaño del país y la escasa plantilla federal hacen que estas acciones sean muy limitadas en impacto real.

Según el informe European Electricity Review 2026, elaborado por el think tank británico Ember, ambas fuentes renovables alcanzaron el 30,1% de la generación eléctrica en la UE, frente al 29% procedente de carbón, gas y derivados del petróleo.

Este avance se explica principalmente por el fuerte crecimiento de la energía solar, que aumentó un 20,1% respecto a 2024, encadenando cuatro años consecutivos de incrementos similares. La solar aportó el 13,2% del total de electricidad generada en la UE, mientras que la eólica alcanzó el 16,9%. Desde 2020, la contribución conjunta de ambas tecnologías ha pasado del 19,7% al 30,1%, lo que para Ember refleja un cambio estructural en el modelo energético europeo.

A pesar de que Adif emitió un certificado que garantiza la operatividad y seguridad de las líneas afectadas, los conductores exigen medidas adicionales antes de retomar su trabajo. La Generalitat, a través del comisionado Pere Macias, ha calificado de 'intolerable' la decisión de los sindicatos y ha abierto un expediente a Renfe por no prestar el servicio, instando a la compañía a asumir responsabilidades. Desde Renfe, su portavoz Antonio Carmona ha señalado que existe voluntad negociadora para resolver el conflicto, pero que los maquinistas continúan con sus exigencias. Por su parte, el ministro de Transporte, Óscar Puente, ha pedido confianza a los trabajadores y ha asegurado que se espera poder restablecer el servicio entre esta tarde y mañana.

Ambos fueron arrestados en el mismo acceso a su vivienda y posteriormente trasladados a un centro de detención en Texas. La superintendenta del distrito explicó que, cuando llegó al lugar, el coche del padre seguía en marcha y agentes federales ya habían sacado al menor del vehículo.

Según el testimonio de la responsable escolar, un agente llevó al niño hasta la puerta de su casa y le indicó que llamara para comprobar si había más personas dentro, una actuación que calificó de utilización del menor como “cebo”. Un adulto que se encontraba en el domicilio solicitó hacerse cargo del niño para evitar su detención, pero la petición fue rechazada.

Las llamas fueron detectadas alrededor de las 20:30 horas en una zona próxima a la localidad nijareña de Rodalquilar, conocida por su pasado minero ligado a las antiguas explotaciones de oro.

Desde el primer momento, el fuego movilizó un importante dispositivo del Servicio de Extinción de Incendios Forestales de Andalucía (INFOCA). En las labores de extinción participaron tres grupos de bomberos forestales, un técnico de operaciones, un agente de Medio Ambiente y dos autobombas. Las tareas se desarrollaron en condiciones complicadas, especialmente por las fuertes rachas de viento que han azotado la comarca, un factor que dificulta notablemente el control del perímetro y aumenta el riesgo de propagación.

El problema es especialmente grave en los centros de gran tamaño gestionados por la Agencia Madrileña de Atención Social (AMAS), donde se dan situaciones extremas como la presencia de una sola enfermera para atender a hasta 600 residentes durante turnos nocturnos.

El informe de la Cámara de Cuentas correspondiente a 2024 ha revelado que el Gobierno autonómico autorizó el traspaso de más de 61 millones de euros del presupuesto de la AMAS para financiar actividad sanitaria prestada en 2021 por la Fundación Jiménez Díaz, perteneciente al grupo privado Quirón.

La Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo considera que no existen razones jurídicas suficientes para suspender los trámites administrativos iniciados para el traslado y subraya que la situación en los territorios de origen es insostenible desde el punto de vista de la protección de los menores.

Según la resolución, Ceuta y Canarias llevan meses alertando de un desbordamiento grave de sus sistemas de acogida, con una ocupación que triplica su capacidad ordinaria. Mantener a los menores en esas condiciones, señala el tribunal, sería “gravemente perjudicial” para su bienestar, por lo que frenar los traslados solo serviría para prolongar una situación ya calificada como dañina.

A partir de su libro de relatos ‘Mari contra la pobreza’, Montalbán utiliza la ficción como herramienta para visibilizar situaciones cotidianas de precariedad que suelen permanecer ocultas o normalizadas.

El autor explica que la sociedad identifica con facilidad la pobreza severa, pero tiende a ignorar la pobreza “a secas”, pese a que una parte muy significativa de la población murciana vive en riesgo de exclusión. Esta invisibilización se debe, según él, a la persistente idea de que la pobreza es culpa de quien la padece y al rechazo colectivo a asumir que sus causas son sociales y políticas. Reconocerla implicaría cuestionar el modelo económico y social existente.

Tras una vigilancia discreta, los agentes detuvieron el vehículo de los implicados y encontraron en su interior más de un kilo de percebes, más de seis kilos de oricios y medio kilo de llámpares (lapas), todo extraído sin la licencia preceptiva de pesca.

Los dos vecinos de la zona fueron identificados y propuestos para sanción administrativa por carecer de autorización para la extracción de marisco. Además, el conductor del coche no poseía permiso de conducir válido, por lo que el Destacamento de Tráfico de la Guardia Civil de Ribadesella instruyó las diligencias penales correspondientes.

Este documento supone un cambio significativo respecto a la práctica histórica del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), que hasta ahora no había autorizado entradas domiciliarias basadas solo en órdenes administrativas.

En el tercer trimestre de 2025, el 1% más rico de los hogares controlaba el 31,7% de toda la riqueza del país, la mayor proporción registrada desde que existen estadísticas comparables. En términos absolutos, este grupo acumula unos 55 billones de dólares en activos, una cifra similar a la riqueza total del 90% inferior de la población estadounidense.

Los economistas advierten de que esta concentración no es un fenómeno puntual, sino una tendencia que se ha intensificado especialmente desde la pandemia. Mientras que el crecimiento del patrimonio de las clases medias y bajas se ha estancado o ralentizado, las grandes fortunas han seguido aumentando a gran velocidad.

Inicialmente, sus operadores afirmaron que la suspensión no estaba relacionada con su reciente scraping masivo de datos de Spotify (incluyendo metadatos y canciones de las pistas más reproducidas, con un total estimado de 300 TB). Sin embargo, documentos judiciales desclasificados revelan que sí fue consecuencia directa de una demanda presentada por Spotify junto a las grandes discográficas Sony, Warner y Universal Music Group (UMG) en el Tribunal de Distrito del Sur de Nueva York.

La demanda se presentó sellada a finales de diciembre de 2025 y el 2 de enero de 2026 se concedió una orden de restricción temporal (TRO) de manera ex parte, sin notificar a Anna’s Archive para evitar que publicaran inmediatamente los archivos de audio scrapeados.

El proyecto ferroviario, clave para la conexión de Euskadi con la alta velocidad y con los corredores europeos, acumula ya 2.200 millones de euros en sobrecostes y más de 20 años de retraso respecto a los plazos inicialmente previstos.

Según el calendario original, la infraestructura debía estar en funcionamiento en 2010. Posteriormente, una revisión del plan realizada en 2020 fijó 2023 como nueva fecha objetivo. Ninguna de ellas se cumplió. En 2024, la Comisión Europea situó la posible finalización en 2030, pero el propio informe recoge que los promotores del proyecto ya apuntan a 2035 como horizonte más realista, lo que supondría un retraso superior a dos décadas.

En el apartado económico, el informe destaca un incremento muy significativo del presupuesto.

Buffett compró unos grandes almacenes en Baltimore durante el auge de los centros comerciales y se encontró con que la competencia instalaba escaleras mecánicas para atraer clientes. Él replicó la acción, pero pronto se dio cuenta de que la inversión no aumentaba las ventas ni atraía más clientes; simplemente mantenía a los que ya tenía, generando costes innecesarios. El economista Michael Burry utiliza esta analogía para advertir que empresas como Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Palantir o Meta podrían estar repitiendo el mismo patrón con la IA: gastando grandes cantidades de dinero para mantener una ventaja percibida, pero sin un retorno real proporcional a la inversión.

Sin embargo, el artículo técnico detalla que las antenas ESA de bajo perfil de Starlink (solo 2,5-3,5 pulgadas de altura), instaladas en la zona trasera del fuselaje donde el ángulo de ataque (AoA) del avión y la capa límite reducen la exposición al viento, tendrían un impacto mucho menor, estimado en torno al 0,3%, frente al 1-2,2% de sistemas tradicionales más voluminosos.

La diferencia fiscal entre ambos productos es considerable: mientras el fuelóleo tributa a 0,56 euros por tonelada métrica, el gasóleo lo hace a 222 euros por cada mil litros.

Rutte confirmó posteriormente que la descripción de Trump era correcta, aunque evitó ofrecer detalles concretos sobre el contenido del acuerdo, subrayando que las conversaciones continuarán. Como consecuencia inmediata, Trump aseguró que Estados Unidos renuncia a imponer los aranceles previstos para el 1 de febrero a ocho países aliados que habían desplegado tropas en Groenlandia en apoyo de la soberanía danesa.

Líderes demócratas como Hakeem Jeffries han calificado la intervención como una 'vergüenza' para el país, mientras que el senador Dick Durbin ha criticado la falta de humildad y verdad del presidente, advirtiendo que las amenazas y fanfarronerías de Trump están agotando la paciencia de los aliados y que Estados Unidos pagará un alto precio por su ego. Lo más destacado ha sido la aparición de disidencias dentro del Partido Republicano. El congresista Thomas Massie, conocido por su perfil libertario y sus frecuentes desencuentros con la dirección del partido, publicó un mensaje sarcástico en redes sociales dirigido a Dinamarca: 'Psst, Dinamarca… Díganle a esta administración que los archivos de Epstein están en Groenlandia… perderán todo interés y nunca podrán encontrarlos'.

Tras el abandono de unos inquilinos en 2021, Alberto, que atravesaba graves problemas de adicciones, se instaló en el piso y permitió que otras personas lo usaran, presuntamente como narcopiso. Ante esta situación, la familia de Elisa contrató a una empresa privada de desocupación para recuperar el inmueble.

El encargado de esa empresa, Richard Dantas, logró que las personas que ocupaban la vivienda se marcharan y cambió la cerradura. Sin embargo, según la versión de la familia, acabó quedándose a vivir en el piso desde 2023, pese a no existir un contrato formal de alquiler ni una compraventa cerrada. La familia sostiene que el pago del servicio se hizo sin recibos y que Dantas fue retrasando su salida con promesas incumplidas de compra del inmueble.

Esta instalación genera fuerzas de hasta 1.900 veces la gravedad terrestre (1.900 g-toneladas), superando el récord anterior establecido por su predecesora CHIEF1300 hace apenas meses y al anterior líder mundial, una centrifugadora estadounidense de 1.200 g-toneladas.

El sistema permite simular en laboratorio condiciones extremas que en la naturaleza tardarían siglos o milenios en desarrollarse, acelerando procesos físicos mediante la aplicación de hipergravedad a modelos a escala reducida. De esta forma, se 'comprime' el tiempo y el espacio experimentalmente: por ejemplo, se ha probado la estabilidad de una presa de casi 300 metros utilizando un modelo de solo tres metros sometido a unas 100 veces la gravedad terrestre, reproduciendo tensiones reales en poco tiempo.

Esta frase surgió al comentar las críticas habituales que recibe por su estilo autoritario y al destacar que su discurso recibió buenas reseñas, a diferencia de lo que suele ocurrir. El comentario se produce en un contexto de tensiones internacionales agravadas por su insistencia en adquirir Groenlandia (confundiéndola repetidamente con Islandia), amenazas de aranceles a países europeos y aliados de la OTAN que se oponen, y una retórica agresiva hacia Canadá y Europa. Como consecuencia, el Parlamento Europeo ha congelado un acuerdo comercial con Estados Unidos, fondos de pensiones daneses y suecos han empezado a deshacerse de bonos del Tesoro estadounidense, y Rusia ha expresado satisfacción por las divisiones en la OTAN.

Sin embargo, en el mismo comunicado reconocía que podían haberse visto expuestos datos personales como nombre, apellidos, DNI, dirección, IP, correo electrónico y teléfono.

El hacker, conocido como daghetiaw, ha rebatido públicamente esa versión asegurando que no se trató solo de accesos mediante credenciales reutilizadas, sino de una intrusión más profunda.

Estas declaraciones provocaron reacciones inmediatas de incomodidad entre los asistentes de alto nivel, incluyendo abucheos generalizados, entre ellos del exvicepresidente estadounidense Al Gore. La situación escaló hasta el punto de que la presidenta del Banco Central Europeo, Christine Lagarde, se levantó de su asiento y abandonó la sala mientras Lutnick seguía hablando, dejándolo con la palabra en la boca.

Uno de los aspectos más relevantes abordados es la cuestión de Gibraltar. Powell sostiene que, en conversaciones privadas con responsables británicos a comienzos de los años ochenta, Juan Carlos I llegó a admitir que el objetivo real de España no era recuperar el Peñón, sino garantizar el ingreso en la Comunidad Económica Europea. La reivindicación de Gibraltar, explica, servía sobre todo para gestionar la opinión pública, sin poner en riesgo la priorid]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-juan-carlos-i-en-la-politica-exterior-espanola-y-la-realpolitik-sobre-gibraltar-y-europa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-papel-de-juan-carlos-i-en-la-politica-exterior-espanola-y-la-realpolitik-sobre-gibraltar-y-europa</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 20:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crítica historiográfica al libro de Josep M.

Solé Sabaté, titulado 'La Cerdanya republicana i antifranquista, Joan Solé Cristòfol'. El texto denuncia el carácter apologético y poco riguroso de la obra, que presenta una biografía elogiosa del alcalde de Bellver durante la Guerra Civil, Joan Solé Cristòfol, omitiendo evidencias documentales que cuestionan la versión oficial de los 'Hechos de Bellver' del 27 de abril de 1937. Según el autor de la recensión, estos hechos no fueron un combate defensivo contra un asalto anarquista liderado por Antonio Martín Escudero ('El Cojo de Málaga'), sino una emboscada y asesinato premeditado en el que participó el hermano del alcalde, Emili Solé, con implicación de milicianos del PSUC, ERC y otros grupos.

La imagen, descontextualizada deliberadamente, fue utilizada para generar indignación y alimentar una narrativa de desprestigio contra la comunicadora.

Tal y como ha explicado el activista contra la desinformación Julián Macías, la escena difundida corresponde en realidad a un momento en el que Maldonado y su interlocutor estaban hablando de la solidaridad mostrada por el pueblo de Adamuz tras la tragedia. La sonrisa de la periodista no tenía relación alguna con el accidente en sí, sino que respondía a un gesto de complicidad durante la conversación. Basta con ver el vídeo completo para comprobar que la acusación carece de fundamento.

Tras el acto, el portavoz del Gobierno madrileño, Miguel Ángel García, ha comparecido y ha vinculado estos sucesos a lo que describe como una gestión 'caótica' del Ministerio de Transportes bajo el Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez. Aunque ha pedido prudencia y respeto a las víctimas mientras avanza la investigación —que aún genera más dudas que certezas—, García ha criticado duramente al ministerio, señalando que dos de sus máximos dirigentes están en una situación complicada: uno en prisión y otro más centrado en redes sociales que en su labor.

Según ha explicado, estas marcas presentan un espesor aproximado de un milímetro y una anchura de varios centímetros, y se repiten de forma similar en los primeros vagones del Iryo, lo que apunta a un posible elemento externo que habría ido dañando progresivamente los bogies delanteros.

Puente ha señalado que Renfe y Adif han revisado trenes que pasaron por la zona en distintos momentos. En los que circularon con una diferencia superior a una hora respecto al Iryo no se han detectado marcas, mientras que en dos o tres trenes anteriores sí se han observado muescas similares, aunque con diferencias, como su aparición solo en uno de los lados del tren.

Esta propuesta surge como alternativa a la compra inicialmente prevista de 88 cazas F-35 estadounidenses, de los cuales solo 16 seguirían adelante al haberse iniciado ya los pagos.

El debate se produce en un clima marcado por los aranceles impulsados por el presidente estadounidense Donald Trump y sus declaraciones sobre una hipotética anexión de Canadá, lo que ha incrementado el recelo de la opinión pública canadiense hacia su vecino del sur.

El Patronato de Protección a la Mujer', analiza en una entrevista con elDiario.es una de las instituciones represivas menos conocidas del franquismo. Este organismo, creado en 1941 y gestionado en gran parte por congregaciones religiosas femeninas, se dedicó a internar a adolescentes y jóvenes mujeres consideradas 'inmorales' o 'en riesgo de caer', sin haber cometido delitos penales. Las causas de ingreso eran vagas y subjetivas: desde salir tarde de casa, tener amigos varones o mostrar interés por los hombres, hasta disidencias políticas en etapas posteriores. El Patronato sobrevivió al fin de la dictadura y continuó operativo hasta 1985, ya en democracia, con financiación estatal y métodos prácticamente idénticos: reclusión, trabajo forzado para empresas, adoctrinamiento religioso intenso, silencio impuesto, control de correspondencia y malas condiciones de vida con frío y hambre.

Esta medida paraliza efectivamente la tramitación del tratado hasta que el tribunal emita su opinión sobre su compatibilidad con los tratados de la UE. Los principales puntos cuestionados son el mecanismo de reequilibrio incluido en el pacto, que algunos eurodiputados consideran que podría limitar la autonomía regulatoria de la UE en materia ambiental y de estándares, y la base legal elegida para su aprobación, que permite ratificar los capítulos comerciales sin necesidad del visto bueno de todos los parlamentos nacionales.

Las primeras conclusiones técnicas descartan tanto el exceso de velocidad como el error humano y apuntan a una holgura mínima en la vía que habría ido aumentando con el paso del tiempo y el tránsito continuado de trenes de alta velocidad.

Según las hipótesis que manejan los investigadores, este defecto no habría sido una rotura súbita ni un fallo puntual, sino un problema localizado en un punto sensible de la vía, posiblemente en una soldadura o en el entorno de un cambio de agujas próximo a una estación técnica. Con el paso de numerosos convoyes, la combinación de peso, fricción y vibraciones habría agrandado progresivamente esa holgura hasta alcanzar un umbral crítico de apenas unos milímetros, suficiente para provocar que una rueda dejara de encajar co]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-investigacion-del-accidente-de-adamuz-apunta-a-un-deterioro-progresivo-de-la-via-como-posible-causa-del-descarrilamiento</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-investigacion-del-accidente-de-adamuz-apunta-a-un-deterioro-progresivo-de-la-via-como-posible-causa-del-descarrilamiento</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 16:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Organizaciones vinculadas a Vox solicitan personarse como acusación popular tras el accidente ferroviario de Adamuz]]></title><description><![CDATA[La tragedia ferroviaria ocurrida en Adamuz (Córdoba), en la que han fallecido al menos 42 personas, ha entrado de lleno en el terreno político y judicial apenas dos días después del accidente.

Esta estructura irregular habría servido para financiar ilegalmente las campañas electorales autonómicas de 2007 y 2011, así como las generales de 2008.

El magistrado argumenta que, más allá de la prescripción de los delitos electorales (los de 2007 y 2008 ya prescritos al citarlos como investigados, y los de 2011 prescritos para quienes no lo fueran antes del 24 de septiembre de 2016), no existen indicios suficientes que demuestren que Aguirre tuviera conocimiento o participación en los hechos delictivos.

Según este organismo, se trata de la tormenta geomagnética más potente registrada en los últimos 20 años, lo que explica su amplio impacto visual más allá de las regiones polares.

Las tormentas solares se producen cuando el Sol emite grandes cantidades de partículas cargadas, principalmente electrones y protones, que viajan por el espacio e interactúan con el campo magnético terrestre. Al llegar a la Tierra, la magnetosfera actúa como un escudo que canaliza estas partículas hacia las zonas cercanas a los polos. Allí, al chocar con los gases de la atmósfera en la exosfera, se genera la emisión de luz que conocemos como auroras boreales.

Su nombre proviene de la unión de 'velocipede' (bicicleta en francés) y 'dog' (perro en inglés), ya que fueron diseñados originalmente para defender a los ciclistas de los frecuentes ataques de perros, que provocaban numerosos accidentes en esa época. Estas armas se fabricaron en grandes cantidades en toda Europa hasta el comienzo de la Primera Guerra Mundial, aproximadamente entre 1880 y 1920. Inicialmente usaban un cartucho especial de 6 mm Velo-Dog, cargado con proyectiles de pimienta para ahuyentar o de plomo para mayor efectividad. Con el tiempo, ganaron popularidad como armas de defensa personal y se produjeron en calibres más comunes como 6,35 mm y 7,65 mm.

Según el texto, el rector Johan Friedrich Weichle explica que la institución ha decidido darle esta oportunidad tras fijarse en él en los últimos meses, con el objetivo de evitar que personas con potencial artístico terminen desviadas hacia la política, en una clara alusión irónica a la famosa anécdota de que Hitler fue rechazado en su día por esta misma academia. La universidad asegura que no necesita una carpeta de trabajos previos porque han visto un dibujo que Trump hizo para Jeffrey Epstein, el cual consideran 'no malo', y destacan que cuenta con el ego necesario para triunfar al menos como pintor de postales.

Esta decisión deja sin contrato a 250 investigadores que esperaban incorporarse durante cuatro años a la carrera doctoral. La Consejería de Educación alega la necesidad de reformar las bases de la convocatoria, pero no ha proporcionado una fecha concreta para el próximo llamamiento, aunque se prevé que se realice a finales de 2026. Esto implica que dos promociones de egresados de máster competirán simultáneamente por las plazas, aumentando la precariedad y la dificultad para acceder a estos contratos.

Bajo su mandato, la RDA logró avances notables en educación gratuita y universal, un sistema sanitario accesible y de calidad para todos los ciudadanos, y una ambiciosa política de vivienda que construyó cientos de miles de hogares a través de los característicos Plattenbauten prefabricados, con el objetivo de garantizar dignidad y igualdad en el acceso a una vivienda digna. Honecker promovió también la paz internacional, el diálogo con Occidente y el apoyo a movimientos de liberación anticoloniales, manteniendo una alianza estrecha con la Unión Soviética.

Tradicionalmente, tipos más altos fortalecían la moneda al atraer capital, pero ahora los inversores interpretan estas subidas como señal de estrés fiscal en un país con deuda pública cercana al 230 % del PIB, penalizando el riesgo soberano en lugar de premiar la rentabilidad.

Este fenómeno se acelera con la política de la primera ministra Sanae Takaichi, quien asumió en octubre de 2025 y enfrenta elecciones anticipadas. Medidas como la posible rebaja de impuestos a los alimentos han provocado ventas masivas de deuda, con alzas bruscas en rendimientos a 20, 30 y 40 años.

En Zúrich, miles de personas se concentraron para expresar su rechazo al presidente estadounidense, quemando banderas de Estados Unidos y portando pancartas con mensajes como «Put the Trumpster in the dumpster». La protesta derivó en enfrentamientos con la policía, que utilizó cañones de agua, gases irritantes y balas de goma tras recibir lanzamiento de piedras y petardos, aunque no se reportaron heridos. Además, activistas proyectaron una caricatura de Trump en una pista de esquí con la leyenda «Spirit of plutocracy».

El malestar se centra en las reiteradas amenazas de Trump de tomar el control de Groenlandia por motivos de seguridad nacional, sin descartar acciones militares, y sus advertencias de imponer aranceles a países que comercien con el territorio danés.

Técnicos de mantenimiento de Adif, desplazados horas después del suceso, detectaron varias traviesas de hormigón completamente destrozadas a unos 100 metros del punto de descarrilamiento, lo que sugiere el impacto fuerte de un elemento contundente desprendido del tren antes del accidente.

El caso ha cobrado relevancia pública en un contexto de protestas contra el despliegue de agentes de ICE en distintos estados del país y de creciente escrutinio sobre las prácticas de detención de inmigrantes.

Courvelle, de 56 años, trabajaba como agente de detención en una instalación gestionada por Geo Group Inc., una empresa privada contratada por ICE para operar centros de internamiento.

Aquella interfaz, con sus grandes bloques de colores y menú de inicio a pantalla completa, fue muy criticada y rechazada por los usuarios de ordenadores de escritorio tradicionales, ya que estaba pensada principalmente para dispositivos táctiles y móviles como tablets y teléfonos.

Anthony Scaramucci, exdirector de comunicaciones de la Casa Blanca y fundador de SkyBridge Capital, señala que aunque las cifras nominales de dinero, propiedades o inversiones parezcan crecer con los años, el valor real puede disminuir significativamente. Scaramucci pone el ejemplo de la casa que sus padres compraron en 1962 por 16.000 dólares, lo que equivalía a 457 onzas de oro. Hoy, esa misma casa se valora en 750.000 dólares, pero en términos de oro, su valor se ha reducido a 227 onzas. De esta forma, aunque en papel se vea un aumento enorme, el poder adquisitivo real ha caído.

Inicialmente se descartaron problemas graves como ictus, tumores, afecciones vasculares o medulares. Las pruebas realizadas, incluyendo cultivos de sangre y orina, así como estudios de imagen, confirmaron el lunes 19 de enero que padece una osteomielitis de la sínfisis púbica causada por la bacteria Streptococcus dysgalactiae, una infección ósea poco frecuente que afecta a la articulación del pubis y que provocó un pico de fiebre reciente. El director gerente del hospital, Albert Salazar, destacó la evolución clínica muy favorable en solo 24 horas, con notable mejoría en el dolor y la movilidad, sin fiebre actual y con el paciente más estable.

La información, adelantada por el diario The Globe and Mail y confirmada por dos altos funcionarios del Gobierno canadiense, no constituye un plan militar operativo, sino una modelización conceptual que evalúa escenarios extremos derivados del deterioro político entre ambos países.

Según el análisis, las fuerzas armadas canadienses, con unos 100.000 efectivos entre personal activo y reservas, no podrían resistir más de una semana frente a la superioridad militar estadounidense. Ante ese escenario, la respuesta canadiense pasaría por adoptar tácticas de guerra de guerrillas, similares a las empleadas históricamente por los afganos frente a potencias militares muy superiores, basadas en emboscadas, sabotajes y acciones de pequeñas unidades paramilitares o civiles armados.

Lejos de la imagen habitual del estado asociada a las Montañas Rocosas, las estaciones de esquí y el imaginario del Lejano Oeste, esta región árida y aislada conserva una profunda herencia histórica y cultural vinculada a España y México. Durante siglos perteneció a la Corona española y, tras la independencia, pasó a manos de Estados Unidos con el Tratado de Guadalupe Hidalgo, que teóricamente garantizaba el respeto al idioma, la religión y las propiedades de sus habitantes hispanos.

El aislamiento geográfico del valle ha permitido la conservación de tradiciones comunitarias, sistemas de gestión del agua basados en acequias y, de forma especialmente llamativa, una variedad arcaica del castellano conocida como español nuevo mexicano.

El partido estuvo marcado por una gran controversia arbitral: en el minuto 92 se anuló un gol a Senegal por una supuesta falta sobre Achraf Hakimi, y poco después el árbitro congoleño Jean-Jacques Ngambo Ndala señaló un penalti a favor de Marruecos por un leve contacto sobre Brahim Díaz, tras revisar el VAR. Esto provocó que el seleccionador senegalés ordenara a sus jugadores abandonar el campo durante más de veinte minutos en señal de protesta, con intentos de invasión del césped por parte de aficionados. Sadio Mané convenció a sus compañeros para regresar, y Brahim Díaz falló el penalti con un lanzamiento a lo Panenka que Édouard Mendy detuvo fácilmente.

Vistisen afirmó con firmeza que Groenlandia forma parte del Reino de Dinamarca desde hace 800 años, que es un territorio integrado y que no está en venta, en respuesta a las renovadas presiones de Trump para que Estados Unidos adquiera el control de la isla ártica, considerada estratégica por motivos de seguridad nacional y mundial.

El parlamentario, de 38 años, escaló su intervención con un insulto explícito: «Señor Presidente, f—k off» (en español, algo como «que te j—an» o «vete a la m—da»), utilizando un lenguaje que consideró comprensible para Trump.

Según los datos de la Corporación de Reservas Estratégicas de Productos Petrolíferos (CORES), el país ha pasado de no importar crudo estadounidense hasta 2016 a convertir a Estados Unidos en su primer proveedor de petróleo en la actualidad. Desde hace cuatro años, el crudo procedente de EEUU lidera el volumen de importaciones, con cifras que alcanzaron los 10,2 millones de toneladas en 2024 y 9,13 millones en 2025.

Este giro se explica por varios factores. En primer lugar, la liberalización de las exportaciones de crudo por parte de EEUU a partir de 2016 abrió la puerta a nuevos mercados como el español. Posteriormente, la pandemia no frenó esta tendencia y la guerra de Ucrania, junto al veto europeo al petróleo ruso y las restricciones al crudo venezolano, reforzaron aún más la apuesta por el suministro estadounidense.

La polémica surge en un contexto de creciente tensión política internacional, después de que Donald Trump, presidente de Estados Unidos, haya amenazado con anexionarse Groenlandia y con imponer aranceles más altos a los países europeos que se opongan a sus planes. Estas declaraciones han generado inquietud en Alemania y han abierto un debate público sobre la idoneidad de participar en un evento deportivo de primer nivel organizado en gran parte por Estados Unidos.

Mientras continúa la investigación sobre las causas del siniestro, el Ministerio de Transportes ha confirmado que la línea no recuperará la normalidad hasta, al menos, los primeros días de febrero. Esta situación ha tenido un impacto inmediato en la movilidad de miles de viajeros y, sobre todo, en el precio del transporte alternativo.

Con la Alta Velocidad fuera de servicio, la demanda de vuelos entre Madrid y Andalucía se ha disparado. Como consecuencia, numerosos usuarios han denunciado subidas extremas en los precios de los billetes de avión, que en algunos casos han llegado a superar los 1.000 euros por trayecto, cuando lo habitual es que cuesten en torno a 50 euros.

Describe cómo una clienta de clase media-alta, acompañada de su madre, exige a una empleada bancaria realizar una operación no permitida por la normativa interna. Ante la negativa cortés de la trabajadora, la clienta reacciona con indignación no solo por el rechazo, sino por el hecho de que una persona situada más abajo en la jerarquía social se atreva a negarle algo.

Esta anécdota sirve para mostrar cómo las estructuras de clase se manifiestan en interacciones aparentemente banales.

Analizando datos de más de 3 800 participantes de 70 años o más, los investigadores observaron que aquellos vacunados presentaban niveles más bajos de inflamación crónica y perfiles genéticos más jóvenes en comparación con los no vacunados. Este efecto parece persistente incluso años después de la inmunización. La inflamación sistémica de bajo nivel, conocida como 'inflammaging', está asociada al desarrollo de enfermedades cardiovasculares, deterioro cognitivo y fragilidad, por lo que su reducción puede contribuir a un envejecimiento más saludable.

Informes recientes muestran que los productos israelíes, especialmente cítricos y mangos, están siendo rechazados en mercados europeos y asiáticos, lo que amenaza con un colapso económico del sector. En kibbutzim como Givat Haim Ichud y Ein Hahoresh, agricultores describen cómo los pedidos se cancelan y la fruta queda sin vender, forzando la venta a mercados locales a precios más bajos o incluso a su desperdicio.

Según los servicios de emergencia, el descarrilamiento se produjo al chocar el tren contra un muro que había caído sobre las vías. El incidente ha dejado al menos cuatro heridos graves, incluido el conductor, y varias personas han quedado atrapadas, aunque no se han registrado fallecidos. La circulación ferroviaria entre Sant Sadurní d'Anoia y Gelida ha sido interrumpida y Protecció Civil ha activado el plan Ferrocat para gestionar la emergencia. Este accidente se suma a otro menor ocurrido en la línea RG1, donde un tren impactó con una roca y salió de la vía, provocando la interrupción del servicio aunque sin heridos.

La detención se produjo este martes por orden de la Sección Segunda del tribunal, que reclama al detenido para que comparezca como acusado en un juicio al que no se había presentado en tres convocatorias anteriores. La persona arrestada, D. H. L, es uno de los tres vecinos de Arahal implicados en la trama que permitía a González Amador defraudar más de 350.000 euros mediante facturas de servicios supuestamente realizados pero que en realidad no existieron. Según la investigación, D. H. L habría facilitado sociedades sin actividad, sin sede real ni empleados, para emitir dichas facturas.

Además, Sánchez recordó que Quiles enfrenta investigaciones por delitos de injurias y calumnias, y que ya existe una causa abierta por intromisión ilegítima en su derecho al honor. La disputa se intensificó cuando Quiles citó una condena previa de Sánchez por insultos, que este aclaró fue anulada por caducidad del procedimiento en 2024 debido a la falta de impulso de la demandante. FACUA y Sánchez subrayaron que dicha sentencia contenía errores y fue difundida de manera tergiversada durante años.

Algunos usuarios bromean y muestran sorpresa al pensar que Little Saint James, más conocida como Epstein Island, formaba parte de la compra original de 1917. En realidad, en 1917 EE. UU. compró las Islas Vírgenes Danesas, que incluyen Saint Thomas, Saint John y Saint Croix, por 25 millones de dólares en oro. Little Saint James fue adquirida de manera privada por Jeffrey Epstein en 1998, mucho después de la cesión estadounidense. La isla se hizo tristemente famosa por los presuntos delitos sexuales de Epstein y por las investigaciones y demandas legales posteriores. Esta confusión ha generado memes y comentarios sobre la relación entre la compra histórica de tierras y la notoriedad de Epstein.

El régimen euroatlántico evolucionó desde una dorsal atlántica a una fase de NAO positiva, mientras que sobre la Península se sucedieron distintos marcos sinópticos, con especial protagonismo de depresiones atlánticas y situaciones de transición.

Las precipitaciones fueron el fenómeno más relevante. Tras las primeras lluvias postfrontales en el suroeste peninsular a comienzos de semana, el episodio más significativo se produjo el miércoles, cuando se formó un Sistema Convectivo de Mesoescala que afectó especialmente a Andalucía occidental.

Ford, el portaaviones nuclear más avanzado de la Marina de Estados Unidos, enfrenta un problema crítico que amenaza su operatividad: su sistema de saneamiento de residuos, conocido como VCHT, sufre atascos recurrentes desde su entrada en servicio, afectando la vida a bordo y la eficiencia del buque. Este sistema de vacío, diseñado para mover residuos a través de cientos de kilómetros de tuberías hasta tanques de tratamiento, no soporta la carga de más de 4.000 tripulantes y se ve agravado por objetos inapropiados que se arrojan a los inodoros, así como por la complejidad añadida de los baños neutrales sin urinarios. Los fallos generan situaciones de insalubridad y obligan a reparaciones constantes que requieren costosos lavados con ácido, imposibles de realizar en alta mar, lo que limita la autonomía logística que caracteriza a este tipo de buques.

Ante esta presión, algunos analistas plantean que la UE podría recurrir a un instrumento financiero potente: la venta masiva de activos estadounidenses, conocida como 'Sell America'. Europa posee entre ocho y doce billones de dólares en bonos del Tesoro, acciones y otros activos de EE.UU., representando cerca del 40% de la deuda pública estadounidense en manos extranjeras. Países como Bélgica, Luxemburgo, Francia e Irlanda destacan como grandes tenedores, junto al Reino Unido (fuera de la UE). Esta acumulación se debe a los superávits por cuenta corriente europeos, que han financiado durante años los déficits gemelos de EE.UU.

El exgeneral Shirreff, en un artículo para el Daily Mail, considera que Europa ha fallado al adoptar una política de apaciguamiento y que Estados Unidos se comporta como un actor hostil, calificándolo incluso de “depredador”. Esta situación podría desencadenar un conflicto en territorio groenlandés, lo que supondría el fin de la OTAN.

Desde su toma de posesión, Trump ha insistido en que Estados Unidos debe adquirir Groenlandia por motivos de seguridad nacional, lo que ha generado fuerte rechazo en Groenlandia, Dinamarca y líderes europeos, quienes defienden el derecho de la isla a decidir su futuro como territorio autónomo. Trump no ha descartado el uso de la fuerza y, recientemente, envió una carta al primer ministro noruego Jonas Gahr Støre reafirmando su deseo de control total sobre Groenlandia. Tras no recibir el Premio Nobel de la Paz en 2025 (otorgado a la opositora venezolana María Corina Machado), Trump afirmó en su mensaje que ya no se siente obligado a pensar solo en la paz, vinculando indirectamente esta frustración a su postura agresiva.

Este intercambio se produjo en un tono sarcástico y jocoso, pero con un trasfondo serio relacionado con las investigaciones que vinculan a Epstein con figuras prominentes, incluido Trump. Colbert, conocido por su estilo incisivo, aprovechó la ocasión para hacer una crítica indirecta a la falta de transparencia y el misterio que aún rodea la muerte de Epstein y sus conexiones con poderosos personajes internacionales. A pesar de la liviandad del momento, la pregunta de Colbert tocó un tema sensible que sigue siendo de gran interés para la opinión pública, especialmente después de las acusaciones de abuso y tráfico sexual que pesaron sobre Epstein antes de su muerte. La respuesta de Trump no fue clara, lo que aumentó aún más las especulaciones sobre los archivos desaparecidos y su contenido.

La decisión, anunciada el 20 de enero, no supone la cancelación definitiva del acuerdo, cerrado el pasado mes de julio tras meses de duras negociaciones, pero sí envía una señal política clara de descontento hacia la Casa Blanca.

El pacto contemplaba, entre otros aspectos, la eliminación de aranceles sobre productos industriales estadounidenses, y su votación estaba prevista para las próximas semanas. Al aplazarla, los eurodiputados buscan ganar margen de presión frente a Washington y advertir de que la UE está dispuesta a responder si las amenazas se materializan.

Encerradas tras murallas defensivas, las urbes no podían crecer hacia el exterior, lo que llevó a aprovechar cualquier espacio disponible. El puente ofrecía suelo ‘nuevo’, sin necesidad de ampliar murallas, y además permitía a los ayuntamientos recaudar rentas.

Estos puentes-calle eran el centro neurálgico del comercio, ya que todo el tránsito de personas y mercancías pasaba por ellos. Artesanos y mercaderes instalaban sus tiendas en la planta baja y vivían encima, beneficiándose en muchos casos de exenciones fiscales. Desde el punto de vista técnico, sostener edificios de varias plantas sobre pilares de piedra exigió soluciones ingeniosas, como voladizos de madera y sistemas de distribución de cargas propios del gótico.

Las comunidades locales, ante la escasa respuesta estatal, se organizaron en brigadas autoconvocadas con herramientas básicas para combatir las llamas, salvando casas y chacras en condiciones extremas agravadas por el cambio climático: reducción del 30-40 % de precipitaciones, inviernos con poca nieve y sequía prolongada, según informes del INTA. El artículo critica duramente las políticas del gobierno de Javier Milei, quien en mayo de 2025 eliminó la prohibición de cambiar el uso productivo de tierras incendiadas durante décadas y liberalizó la compra de terrenos rurales por extranjeros, creando condiciones que, según el autor, favorecen negocios inmobiliarios en áreas codiciadas por magnates como Luciano Benetto]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/incendios-intencionados-arrasan-14-000-hectareas-en-la-patagonia-argentina-tras-cambios-legislativos-de-milei-que-facilitan-la-explotacion-de-tierras-quemadas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/incendios-intencionados-arrasan-14-000-hectareas-en-la-patagonia-argentina-tras-cambios-legislativos-de-milei-que-facilitan-la-explotacion-de-tierras-quemadas</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 19:47:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Demandas en EE.

Recordó que la isla fue capturada por Noruega en el siglo XIII, pasó a control danés en el XIX y se integró como territorio asociado a Dinamarca solo a mediados del siglo XX. Estas afirmaciones coinciden parcialmente con los argumentos del presidente estadounidense Donald Trump, quien busca el control de la isla por motivos de seguridad nacional, en medio de una creciente tensión diplomática entre EE.UU. y Europa que, según Lavrov, pone en riesgo la unidad de la OTAN y evidencia una crisis acumulada en Occidente.

Los inmuebles figuran contablemente como Ben Charki 28, 30, 32, 36 y 38-40, con valores individuales que varían entre 10.000 y 100.000 euros, lo que sugiere que podrían tratarse de unidades independientes o de un mismo complejo residencial dividido registralmente, algo habitual en Marruecos para propiedades grandes.

Aunque rechaza una comparación directa de personalidades entre Trump y Hitler, el autor examina el proceso histórico mediante el cual los nazis consolidaron el poder absoluto en Alemania en 1933: tras unas elecciones controvertidas, obtuvieron una mayoría parlamentaria que aprobó la ley habilitante (Ermächtigungsgesetz), entregando todos los poderes legislativos al Gobierno y eliminando la separación de poderes, para después prohibir el resto de partidos.

El texto advierte de paralelismos en las declaraciones de Trump, quien ha afirmado que su poder como comandante en jefe solo está limitado por su conciencia, y menciona eventos recientes como el secuestro del dictador venezolano Nicolás Maduro por parte de EE UU, visto como una violación flagrante del Derecho internacional que podría servir para desviar]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-historico-como-se-podria-llegar-a-un-cambio-autoritario-en-ee-uu-segun-el-ejemplo-nazi</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/analisis-historico-como-se-podria-llegar-a-un-cambio-autoritario-en-ee-uu-segun-el-ejemplo-nazi</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:45:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Una exdirectiva tecnológica denuncia la cultura de la industria y defiende un modelo empresarial centrado en las personas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La doctora Stevie Yap anuncia públicamente su salida del sector tecnológico con una dura reflexión sobre la deriva ética y humana de la industria. En su testimonio, explica que abandona un entorno donde, según denuncia, el beneficio económico y la presión por el crecimiento acelerado se imponen sistemáticamente sobre las personas. Yap señala que muchos despidos no responden al rendimiento profesional, sino a decisiones estratégicas cortoplacistas tomadas por la alta dirección, a menudo justificadas bajo el argumento de la inteligencia artificial o de la necesidad de mejorar resultados financieros.

La autora cuestiona abiertamente el relato dominante sobre la IA como principal causante de la destrucción de empleo, y sostiene que el problema real reside en liderazgos que priorizan el valor para el accionista y los bonus ejecutivos frente a la planificación responsable y el bienestar de las plantillas.

Los afectados y sus familias sufrieron durante años la desatención, mentiras y retrasos por parte de las administraciones, teniendo que esperar más de once años para una sentencia judicial. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) determinó inicialmente que la causa del siniestro fue exceso de velocidad y un despiste del maquinista, sin considerar los fallos en la infraestructura denunciados por las víctimas. Gracias a la intervención de la eurodiputada Ana Miranda y la Comisión Europea, se cuestionó la independencia de la investigación y se impulsaron mejoras en la normativa de seguridad ferroviaria. A pesar de ello, las víctimas enfrentaron un proceso judicial largo y complejo, con irregularidades denunciadas como ocultación de documentos y condicionamiento de testigos a favor de Adif.

Entre ellos destaca especialmente la colección de figuras Funko incluidas en los huevos de chocolate Kinder Joy, que se ha convertido en un fenómeno en toda Europa, llegando a agotarse completamente el stock en muchas zonas, incluida la localidad pontevedresa de A Estrada.

En esta villa, varios comercios como A Chocolatería y Arco da Vella han experimentado una demanda desmesurada. Tras semanas sin reposición por la rotura global de stock en fábrica, cuando llegaron nuevas unidades (en algunos casos diez cajas de 36 huevos), se vendieron rápidamente.

Los autores, Julio González García (Catedrático de Derecho Administrativo en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid) y Ana Medina (exsubdirectora de Servicios Jurídicos de Correos), critican el modelo lineal habitual: el negocio se diseña primero y el asesoramiento legal llega al final, lo que convierte al jurídico en un órgano de veto, limita las opciones normativas y desplaza responsabilidades de gestión al ámbito legal. Proponen incorporar el criterio jurídico desde el origen del proyecto (legal by design), integrándolo con los aspectos financieros, tecnológicos y operativos para hacer viables las iniciativas con seguridad jurídica.

En la primera votación no logró la mayoría absoluta necesaria, pero finalmente salió adelante gracias a los 29 escaños del grupo popular. El resto de formaciones votaron a sus propios candidatos: PSOE, Vox y Unidas por Extremadura, evidenciando la falta de acuerdos entre los bloques parlamentarios.

La elección de Naharro se produce en un contexto de fuerte controversia política y mediática debido a informaciones publicadas en meses anteriores sobre mensajes privados que habría enviado a un exmilitante del PP. En dichos mensajes, según la información contrastada judicialmente, el dirigente popular ofrecía un puesto de chófer con un salario de 1.800 euros mensuales en 14 pagas, acompañado de insinuaciones sexuales explícitas.

Según la información publicada por AraInfo, este proyecto podría suponer una merma de más de 17 millones de euros para las arcas municipales debido a la bonificación o exención del Impuesto sobre Construcciones, Instalaciones y Obras (ICIO).

El presupuesto total de la obra asciende a más de 858 millones de euros, a los que se aplicaría un tipo del 4% en concepto de ICIO. Sin embargo, la normativa municipal permite bonificaciones de hasta el 50% por fomento del empleo, lo que reduciría drásticamente la recaudación prevista.

El ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, ha confirmado que este coche aún no ha sido analizado y ha subrayado que su estudio es fundamental para encajar todas las piezas del suceso.

El tren Iryo, compuesto por ocho coches, sufrió el descarrilamiento de sus tres últimos vagones cuando circulaba por la línea de alta velocidad Madrid-Andalucía. Según los primeros indicios, el coche seis inició el descarrilamiento, mientras que el coche ocho se salió completamente de la vía.

A las 10.00 horas, docentes y otros miembros de la comunidad educativa se han concentrado frente al edificio Pignatelli de Zaragoza, sede del Ejecutivo aragonés.

La defensa argumenta que existe una jurisprudencia pacífica consolidada en España que impide exigir a un investigado la aportación de documentación probatoria en su contra, pues ello vulneraría su derecho constitucional a no declarar contra sí mismo y a guardar silencio.

La iniciativa se centra en promover software y ecosistemas abiertos, entendidos como bienes públicos que pueden ser utilizados, inspeccionados, adaptados y redistribuidos libremente, fomentando la transparencia, la seguridad y la innovación distribuida. Según Enrique Dans, este modelo se alinea con los valores sociales europeos y busca evitar replicar los desequilibrios del modelo estadounidense, donde el libre mercado sin regulaciones ha producido desigualdades significativas en salud, educación y bienestar.

Según Ismael Rodrigo, presidente de la Federación Española de Naturismo, los jóvenes muestran interés por el cuerpo natural, pero evitan implicarse en el activismo y la gestión de asociaciones debido a la moral puritana impuesta por las redes sociales. Estas plataformas censuran la desnudez no sexual (como pezones femeninos) y promueven cuerpos perfectos e irreales mediante filtros y algoritmos, lo que desplaza la aceptación social del desnudo natural.

Expertos como el psicólogo Roberto Sanz señalan que la ausencia de educación sexual adecuada asocia la desnudez solo al sexo o a la pornografía, aumentando la presión estética sobre cuerpos reales, especialmente en hombres por la influencia de la 'machosfera'. Los vestuarios o gimnasios, donde antes había desnudez casual, se han convertido en espacios de comparación y juicio.

A pesar de todo, un 40 % de jóvenes entre 18 y 34 años estarí]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-nudismo-pierde-relevo-generacional-por-la-influencia-puritana-de-las-redes-sociales-y-los-ideales-esteticos-irreales</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-nudismo-pierde-relevo-generacional-por-la-influencia-puritana-de-las-redes-sociales-y-los-ideales-esteticos-irreales</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exempleados de mantenimiento demandan a Julio Iglesias por despido improcedente en su mansión de Punta Cana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tres exempleados de mantenimiento de la mansión de Julio Iglesias en Punta Cana (República Dominicana), conocida como Villa Corales 5, han demandado al cantante por despido improcedente tras ser despedidos en 2020 al inicio de la pandemia de COVID-19.

La motivación real detrás de este impulso no es ideológica, ya que Groenlandia no representa un enemigo político; el interés principal es económico: las empresas estadounidenses buscan explotar los recursos minerales del territorio y algunos multimillonarios consideran a Groenlandia como un espacio de inversión desregulado. Históricamente, Estados Unidos ha mostrado patrones similares de expansión vinculados a concentraciones extremas de riqueza.

Todo cambió tras su participación en las elecciones sindicales de noviembre de 2022 como parte de la candidatura del sindicato CIG, lo que coincidió con la entrada de este sindicato en el comité de empresa. En 2024, la empleada sufrió una lesión en la muñeca en la sección de pescadería, que derivó en una baja por incapacidad temporal reconocida como enfermedad profesional.

El objetivo principal es reducir las quejas vecinales por suciedad en las calles y alrededor de los contenedores, un problema cada vez más frecuente a pesar del aumento del presupuesto en limpieza.

Entre las novedades destacan varias prohibiciones explícitas. Se prohíbe depositar o abandonar residuos domiciliarios fuera de los contenedores adecuados o en lugares no autorizados, con multas de hasta 3.000 €. También se sanciona con la misma cuantía el abandono de residuos industriales como palets o escombros junto a los contenedores.

Durante su actuación, el legendario músico interpretó varias canciones de su repertorio y colaboró improvisadamente con otras bandas presentes.

El momento más destacado ocurrió antes de interpretar 'The Promised Land' (La tierra prometida), canción que escribió como oda al potencial de Estados Unidos.

Esto supone un aumento de 898 denuncias respecto a 2024 y una media de 41 casos diarios. De ese total, 951 procedimientos terminaron con resultado de muerte, 153 más que el año anterior, lo que refleja un agravamiento de las consecuencias en los casos denunciados.

Las causas más habituales de las reclamaciones están relacionadas con la mala praxis médica, incluyendo intervenciones quirúrgicas mal realizadas, altas hospitalarias precipitadas, atención sanitaria deficiente, infecciones hospitalarias y retrasos en la asistencia de ambulancias. No obstante, el principal origen de las denuncias sigue siendo el error de diagnóstico y la pérdida de oportunidad terapéutica, factores que pueden resultar determinantes para la evolución de los pacientes.

Trump amenazó con aplicar esta ley para frenar las protestas contra su política migratoria, aunque más tarde matizó la amenaza al señalar que no había motivo para utilizarla de inmediato.

Según el informe, los exportadores extranjeros no redujeron significativamente sus precios ante las subidas arancelarias, lo que resulta en un traslado casi completo del 96% del coste a los compradores estadounidenses, mientras que solo el 4% recae en las empresas extranjeras.

El análisis destaca que el aumento de 200.000 millones de dólares en la recaudación aduanera equivale a una extracción similar de recursos de hogares y empresas de EE.UU., funcionando los aranceles más como un impuesto al consumo interno que como una carga para los productores extranjeros.

Lejos de ser un simple juego de ciencia ficción, el relato utiliza la clonación como excusa narrativa para profundizar en los miedos, rigideces y paradojas que atraviesan al propio Lem como autor y como pensador.

En la conversación intervienen personajes recurrentes del universo de Frabetti, como el metagato Chess o AsimoV, que actúan como voces críticas y contrapuntos irónicos. A través de ellos se cuestiona la idea de una identidad humana fija e indivisible, sugiriendo que, si dos seres comparten recuerdos, mapa mental y autopercepción, la distinción entre original y copia pierde relevancia práctica.

Senegal se proclamó campeón al vencer por 1-0 con un gol en la prórroga de Pape Gueye (jugador del Villarreal), después de un desenlace caótico en el tiempo reglamentario. En el minuto 97, el árbitro señaló un penalti polémico a favor de Marruecos por una falta sobre Brahim Díaz, lo que provocó que los jugadores senegaleses abandonaran temporalmente el terreno de juego por orden de su entrenador, Pape Thiaw, en señal de protesta. El partido estuvo interrumpido más de diez minutos, con intentos de invasión del césped por parte de aficionados senegaleses.

Sin embargo, fuentes ministeriales han precisado que todavía no se ha establecido una relación causal clara, es decir, si esa rotura fue la causa del descarrilamiento o una consecuencia del mismo. La Comisión de Investigación de Accidentes Ferroviarios (CIAF) se encuentra en fase inicial de recopilación de datos, inspecciones en el lugar y extracción de registradores de ambos trenes (un Iryo Málaga-Madrid y un Alvia Madrid-Huelva). Será necesario realizar análisis en laboratorio de los carriles y la rodadura del tren Iryo para avanzar en las hipótesis.

Su denuncia hizo que feministas vascas recopilaran testimonios de otras mujeres que habían sufrido agresiones similares, sumando más de treinta casos en apenas una semana. Las víctimas describen un ambiente de control, relaciones de poder y maltrato psicológico, incluso cuando los agresores se presentan como antifascistas.

Los restos, localizados bajo la Plaza Andrea Costa y alrededores durante excavaciones financiadas por el PNRR, incluyen muros de hasta dos metros de altura, suelos de mármol verde y columnas monumentales cuyo diámetro (1,47 metros, equivalente a cinco pies romanos) coincide exactamente con las descripciones detalladas por Vitruvio.

La narración arranca con la figura legendaria de Marinus, un cantero dálmata que, huyendo de persecuciones en tiempos del Imperio romano, se refugió a finales del siglo III en el Monte Titano y fundó una pequeña comunidad cristiana. Aunque la historia de Marinus es en gran parte mítica y las fuentes documentales no aparecen hasta siglos después, la tradición sitúa en el año 301 el origen simbólico de la república.

A partir de ahí, el texto recorre la evolución histórica del enclave, destacando su temprana organización política y la instauración, en la Edad Media, de un sistema de gobierno singular: la diarquía de los Capitanes Regentes, elegidos cada seis meses. San Marino no fue una anomalía en su contexto original, ya que las ciudades-Estado eran comunes en la Europa medieval, pero sí ha sido una excepción por su conti]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/san-marino-origen-legendario-diplomacia-y-supervivencia-de-la-republica-mas-antigua</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/san-marino-origen-legendario-diplomacia-y-supervivencia-de-la-republica-mas-antigua</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 04:14:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallece Valentino Garavani, icono de la moda italiana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Valentino Garavani, uno de los diseñadores de moda más icónicos de Italia y del mundo, ha fallecido a los 93 años en su residencia de Roma, según ha informado la fundación Valentino Garavani y Giancarlo Giammetti.

En 1959 regresó a Italia y fundó su propio taller, contando con el apoyo económico de su padre y de Giancarlo Giammetti, quien fue también su pareja durante muchos años.

El fundador de WikiLeaks introduce el concepto de 'maquinaria político-mediática', que considera una pieza esencial para sostener y articular el imperio estadounidense, tanto en la metrópoli como en sus países satélites (denominados 'civitas stipendaria').

Este sello era obligatorio para la distribución masiva, lo que provocó el cierre de numerosas editoriales y la salida de cientos de profesionales.

A finales de los años 60 y principios de los 70, el código empezó a quedar obsoleto. Marvel, con Stan Lee a la cabeza, ya había desafiado sus normas con historias sobre drogas sin sello. En febrero de 1971 se revisó el código, permitiendo criaturas de terror siempre que se trataran en la tradición clásica literaria (como Drácula o Frankenstein).

Aprovechando esta relajación, Roy Thomas y Gil Kane crearon a Morbius, el vampiro viviente, que debutó en The Amazing Spider-Man #101 (otoño de 1971).

La disputa se intensificó durante el fin de semana, cuando Trump anunció la imposición de aranceles del 10 % a partir del 1 de febrero —que podrían elevarse hasta el 25 % en junio— a productos procedentes de ocho países aliados, entre ellos varios europeos.

Desde 2020, el incremento acumulado asciende al 81 %, en un contexto en el que una de cada cuatro personas en el mundo no tiene garantizado el acceso regular a alimentos y casi la mitad de la población mundial vive en situación de pobreza.

El informe subraya que en solo un año los multimillonarios aumentaron su riqueza en 2,5 billones de dólares, una cifra prácticamente equivalente a la riqueza total de la mitad más pobre de la humanidad.

El texto de la misiva, difundido oficialmente por el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de la Casa Blanca, destaca por su tono infantil, errores históricos y una visión distorsionada de la realidad internacional.

Applebaum subraya que Trump afirma falsamente haber detenido ocho guerras, desconoce la soberanía histórica y jurídicamente documentada de Dinamarca sobre Groenlandia —reconocida incluso por Estados Unidos— y se atribuye méritos inexistentes dentro de la OTAN. La autora insiste en que lo relevante no es solo la inexactitud de los argumentos, sino el mensaje de fondo: un presidente que parece operar en una realidad paralela, ajeno a las nor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-carta-de-trump-a-noruega-reabre-el-debate-sobre-los-limites-institucionales-en-estados-unidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/una-carta-de-trump-a-noruega-reabre-el-debate-sobre-los-limites-institucionales-en-estados-unidos</guid><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:53:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El grupo ultraderechista Betar cesa su actividad en Nueva York tras un acuerdo con la fiscalía por acoso y violencia]]></title><description><![CDATA[El grupo proisraelí de extrema derecha Betar US pondrá fin a sus operaciones en el estado de Nueva York tras un acuerdo alcanzado con la fiscal general del estado, Letitia James, como resultado de una investigación oficial por conductas violentas, amenazas y acoso motivados por prejuicios. La investigación concluyó que la organización llevó a cabo ataques, intimidaciones y campañas de hostigamiento dirigidas contra personas musulmanas, árabes, palestinas y también judías, vulnerando las leyes de derechos civiles de Nueva York.

El acuerdo obliga a Betar a cesar de inmediato cualquier incitación a la violencia, las amenazas contra manifestantes y el acoso a personas que ejercen sus derechos civiles. Además, establece una sanción económica de 50.000 dólares que queda suspendida, pero que se aplicará si la organización incumple los términos pactados.

Aunque la hipótesis vasco-iberista fue descartada en gran medida durante el siglo XX tras el desciframiento del alfabeto ibérico, recientes análisis internos de inscripciones han revitalizado un enfoque moderado.

El trabajo destaca el sistema numeral ibérico, prácticamente idéntico al vasco (vigésimo, con formas como ban/bat para 'uno', bi para 'dos', laur/lau para 'cuatro', etc.), lo que sugiere un origen común o contacto estrecho. Orduña extiende el análisis a nombres de parentesco y denominaciones personales, identificando elementos recurrentes en contextos no onomásticos típicos (como aur, uni(n), aste, be(i), -kidei), que presentan paralelos con términos vascos o aquitanos: aita (padre), seme (hijo), unide (nodriza), -(k)ide (compañero), etc.

El jugador escribió bajo los ojos, en la franja negra que se utiliza habitualmente para reducir el brillo, el mensaje “Stop the genocide” (“Detened el genocidio”), en referencia a la situación en Gaza. Según la liga, esta acción vulnera el reglamento interno, que prohíbe expresamente la exhibición de mensajes personales, políticos o sociales en el equipamiento o la indumentaria durante los días de partido.

Al-Shaair mostró el mensaje por primera vez en el encuentro de la ronda de Wild Card frente a los Pittsburgh Steelers, partido que los Texans ganaron.

Comenzó su carrera cinematográfica en 1954 con Columbia Pictures y rápidamente destacó en películas como 'Picnic' (1955), 'The Man with the Golden Arm' (1955) y 'Pal Joey' (1957). Su fama se consolidó con 'Vértigo' (1958) de Alfred Hitchcock, considerada hoy una de las mejores películas de la historia. Antes de ser descubierta, trabajó como modelo promocional y fue conocida públicamente como 'Miss Deepfreeze'. A lo largo de su carrera, Novak se mostró determinada a mantener su identidad, evitando los estereotipos impuestos por los estudios, lo que llevó a la creación del nombre artístico Kim Novak. A pesar de su éxito en taquilla, Novak se retiró mayormente de la actuación en 1966, dedicándose a la pintura, los caballos y una vida más tranquila en Big Sur y Oregon.

El siniestro se produjo cuando un tren Iryo, que cubría la ruta Málaga-Madrid, descarriló en los desvíos de entrada a la estación técnica de Adamuz, invadiendo la vía contigua. Apenas 20 segundos después, colisionó frontalmente con un Alvia de Renfe que circulaba en sentido contrario desde Madrid hacia Huelva, a más de 200 km/h. El impacto fue devastador, provocando que varios vagones salieran despedidos y cayeran por un talud cercano.

Entre las víctimas mortales confirmadas por la Guardia Civil se encuentran el periodista onubense Óscar Toro y la fotoperiodista María Clauss, un matrimonio muy conocido en el ámbito cultural y comunicativo de Huelva. Toro, doctor cum laude en Comunicación por la Universidad de Huelva, era director de la Fundación Xul, impulsor de la editorial Voces del Sur y un referent]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-de-periodistas-oscar-toro-y-maria-clauss-entre-las-39-victimas-mortales-del-accidente-ferroviario-de-adamuz</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-matrimonio-de-periodistas-oscar-toro-y-maria-clauss-entre-las-39-victimas-mortales-del-accidente-ferroviario-de-adamuz</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:03:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El cohete SLS de la misión Artemis II llega a la rampa 39B del Kennedy Space Center]]></title><description><![CDATA[El 17 de enero de 2026, el cohete SLS para la misión Artemis II fue trasladado desde el edificio de ensamblaje vertical (VAB) hasta la rampa 39B del Centro Espacial Kennedy, en Florida. Este traslado, que duró casi doce horas a una velocidad máxima de 1,3 km/h, marca el primer gran hito visible de la misión tripulada que llevará a cuatro astronautas alrededor de la Luna, algo que no ocurre desde el Apolo 17 en diciembre de 1972.

El transporte se realizó con el histórico crawler CT-2, una reliquia de la era Apolo modificada para el programa Artemis, que llevó la plataforma móvil ML-1 con el cohete y la nave Orión Integrity sobre un recorrido de 6,8 km. El conjunto completo, sin propelentes, pesa unas 6800 toneladas.

La integración del SLS comenzó en julio de 2024 con la llegada de la etapa central.

Meses antes del siniestro, el sindicato de maquinistas SEMAF había solicitado una reducción de la velocidad máxima, fijada en 250 km/h, en varios tramos de la línea Madrid-Sevilla, incluido el punto exacto donde se produjo el descarrilamiento y posterior colisión.

Los maquinistas alertaban de una 'degradación profunda y acelerada' tanto de los trenes como de la infraestructura, mencionando baches, garrotes, descompensaciones en la catenaria y averías frecuentes, especialmente agravadas por las altas temperaturas y las vibraciones del tráfico ferroviario. Estas advertencias se apoyaban en hechos concretos: en junio de 2025 se registraron dos incidencias en ese mismo tramo relacionadas con dilataciones de la vía y fal]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adif-mantuvo-los-250-km-h-en-el-tramo-de-adamuz-pese-a-las-advertencias-sindicales-y-los-incidentes-previos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/adif-mantuvo-los-250-km-h-en-el-tramo-de-adamuz-pese-a-las-advertencias-sindicales-y-los-incidentes-previos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[China desarrolla un método limpio para reciclar litio de baterías usadas y capturar CO₂]]></title><description><![CDATA[Investigadores de la Academia China de Ciencias y del Instituto de Tecnología de Pekín han desarrollado un proceso innovador para reciclar baterías de litio usando únicamente dióxido de carbono y agua, sin necesidad de químicos agresivos ni calor. Este método permite recuperar hasta el 95% del litio presente en las baterías, a niveles comparables con los procesos industriales tradicionales, pero con un impacto ambiental mucho menor. Además del litio, los metales del cátodo como cobalto, níquel y manganeso se transforman en catalizadores reutilizables, aportando valor añadido. El proceso también captura parte del CO₂, inmovilizándolo en subproductos sólidos, contribuyendo así al secuestro de carbono. Su principal ventaja es que se realiza a temperatura y presión ambiente, reduciendo riesgos laborales, consumo energético y generación de residuos peligrosos. Este enfoque ofrece una solución para la creciente gestión de residuos de baterías en China y podría facilitar el cumplimiento de re]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-desarrolla-un-metodo-limpio-para-reciclar-litio-de-baterias-usadas-y-capturar-co</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/china-desarrolla-un-metodo-limpio-para-reciclar-litio-de-baterias-usadas-y-capturar-co</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:17:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comparación del riesgo soberano entre economías desarrolladas y emergentes a partir de sus indicadores macroeconómicos]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo plantea un ejercicio comparativo para reflexionar sobre el concepto de riesgo país desde una perspectiva puramente cuantitativa, alejándose de prejuicios habituales asociados al desarrollo económico o al peso geopolítico de los Estados. El autor propone imaginar una inversión en bonos soberanos emitidos por distintos países, eliminando variables como el riesgo de divisa o las diferencias de cupón, para centrarse exclusivamente en indicadores macroeconómicos clave. 

Se analizan cinco Estados anónimos, identificados como A, B, C, D y E, a partir de cuatro variables fundamentales: deuda pública en relación con el PIB, déficit público, balanza por cuenta corriente y crecimiento del PIB. El objetivo es que el lector valore cuál de ellos presenta un mayor riesgo de impago y cuáles ofrecen, sobre el papel, una situación fiscal y macroeconómica más sólida.

En el texto, el presidente de Estados Unidos afirmó explícitamente que no siente “la obligación de pensar únicamente en la paz”, vinculando de forma directa su actuación internacional al reconocimiento que, a su juicio, merece. El mensaje ha sido interpretado como una forma de presión política hacia el país que alberga el comité encargado de conceder el galardón.

La misiva no se limita a una queja personal. Trump aprovechó la ocasión para insistir en una de sus posiciones más controvertidas en política exterior: la pretensión de ejercer un “control pleno y absoluto” sobre Groenlandia.

Esta acción provocó una fuerte protesta del combinado senegalés, que llegó a amenazar con abandonar el terreno de juego como muestra de desacuerdo.

Más allá de la polémica arbitral, una de las imágenes más comentadas fue el comportamiento de varios recogepelotas marroquíes y miembros de la organización, que intentaron retirar de forma reiterada la toalla del portero titular de Senegal, Édouard Mendy, situada detrás de la portería.

La magistrada Montserrat Fernández Cabezas considera que estos mensajes estigmatizaban al colectivo trans y a las personas intersexuales o no binarias, atentando contra su dignidad y constituyendo expresiones discriminatorias por motivos de sexo, género y orientación sexual.

El autor desmonta la narrativa del supuesto fraude electoral que fue utilizada posteriormente por los sublevados para justificar el golpe de Estado.

De los 429 asesinatos con motivación ideológica o política documentados entre 2015 y 2024, el 76 % (328 casos) fueron perpetrados por individuos o grupos de extrema derecha. En 2024, todos los asesinatos vinculados a motivos ideológicos fueron atribuidos a esta ideología, según la agencia ADL. Además, en 2025 se observa un aumento significativo, con más del doble de homicidios respecto a años anteriores. A nivel global y occidental, el informe Global Terrorism Index señala un incremento del 320 % en ataques de extrema derecha entre 2014 y 2019. En Europa, los ataques clasificados como 'terroristas de extrema derecha' se duplicaron en 2024, con 449 detenciones relacionadas en la UE.

A pesar de que las causas aún se desconocen y el ministro de Transportes, Óscar Puente, advirtió que especular sería inapropiado, algunos líderes y medios políticos aprovecharon la tragedia para criticar al Gobierno. Santiago Abascal, presidente de Vox, expresó sus condolencias pero añadió críticas hacia la gestión del Ejecutivo, cuestionando su capacidad y profesionalidad. Asimismo, periodistas como Javier Negre y Vito Quiles difundieron mensajes en redes sociales culpando a responsables políticos sin información confirmada. Por otro lado, Pedro Sánchez y otros representantes mostraron su solidaridad con las víctimas y aseguraron que el Estado estaba trabajando para atender a los afectados.

Tras 20 jornadas, con todos los equipos al día en partidos disputados, la clasificación muestra un margen mínimo entre los aspirantes al título: Inter lidera con 46 puntos, seguido de Milan con 43 y Napoli con 40. En este contexto, cada decisión táctica, cada lesión y cada error puntual tiene consecuencias inmediatas.

El empate 2:2 entre Inter y Napoli sirve como ejemplo de esa frontera difusa entre dominar y exponerse. El equipo de Cristian Chivu apuesta por el control del juego a través de la posesión y del dominio territorial, pero esa ambición implica riesgos defensivos que los rivales saben castigar. El tempranero gol de Dimarco reflejó la idea ofensiva del Inter, aunque un fallo propio devolvió al Napoli al partido.

Este edificio del siglo XII, catalogado como Bien de Interés Cultural, había mostrado signos de deterioro durante años, pero las autoridades eclesiásticas negaban indicios de peligro. Expertos señalan que la despoblación, la falta de mantenimiento y factores ambientales, como filtraciones y pequeños movimientos sísmicos recientes, han contribuido al colapso. La situación refleja un problema recurrente en Castilla y León, donde múltiples monumentos y construcciones históricas sufren deterioro por la dejadez institucional.

Este moderno buque reemplaza al anterior 'Pole Star IV' tras 23 años de servicio y se convierte en el quinto buque de la institución con este nombre histórico.

Con 70 metros de eslora y 16 de manga, y un presupuesto aproximado de 60 millones de euros, el diseño —realizado por OSK Design y Seaplace— destaca por su excelente estabilidad, seguridad en operaciones con boyas, gran capacidad de remolque (60 toneladas a punto fijo) y avanzados sistemas de extinción de incendios. El buque está propulsado por dos azimutales de 2000 kW cada uno, alimentados por tres generadores diésel y cuenta con una batería de 4.644 kWh que permite operar en modo 100% eléctrico con cero emisiones, vibraciones ni ruido.

Infantino alabó a Trump destacando su papel como líder que representa 'esperanza, unidad y futuro'. Sin embargo, tras el premio, Estados Unidos ha llevado a cabo bombardeos en Venezuela, capturado y encarcelado al presidente Nicolás Maduro y a su esposa por cargos relacionados con narcoterrorismo, y Trump ha amenazado con invadir Groenlandia alegando necesidades estratégicas del país.

Para 2026, eleva la estimación en 0,3 puntos hasta el 2,3 %, y para 2027 en 0,2 puntos hasta el 1,9 %. Estas son las mayores revisiones al alza entre las economías avanzadas. España se consolida como la locomotora del crecimiento en Europa, superando claramente a Alemania, Francia e Italia, y solo por detrás de Estados Unidos (2,4 % en 2026 y 2 % en 2027). El buen desempeño se explica por el fuerte aumento de la fuerza laboral gracias a la inmigración, los fondos europeos Next Generation y el dinamismo del sector servicios. Además, el efecto arrastre del sólido cierre de 2025 impulsa el crecimiento de 2026 en aproximadamente un punto porcentual.

Estas amenazas consisten en la imposición de aranceles del 10 % a partir del 1 de febrero de 2026 sobre productos de ocho países europeos que han enviado tropas a Groenlandia en el marco de misiones de reconocimiento de la OTAN, con una subida al 25 % en junio si no se llega a un acuerdo para la compra total de la isla por parte de Estados Unidos.

Prévot, en una entrevista en el medio belga VRT NWS, calificó la situación de paradójica, ya que Estados Unidos había pedido mayor atención a la seguridad en el Ártico, y la respuesta de varios aliados de la OTAN fue enviar soldados para misiones de reconocimiento.

Según Manera, el origen de esta crisis no es accidental ni coyuntural, sino el resultado de décadas de aplicación de la nueva ortodoxia neoliberal, caracterizada por dar primacía al mercado, reducir el papel del Estado, liberalizar los movimientos de capital y privatizar empresas públicas. Este modelo ha favorecido una fuerte concentración empresarial y una restricción de la competencia, debilitando las bases productivas de muchas economías.

El texto sitúa el análisis en una perspectiva histórica amplia, dividiendo el último siglo en tres grandes etapas: de 1913 a 1950, de 1950 a 1973 y de 1973 a 2008. Manera subraya que el periodo más próspero fue el comprendido entre 1950 y 1973, marcado por una fuerte inversión pública, altos impuestos a las rentas más altas —con tipos marginales superior]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-economica-provocada-por-decadas-de-neoliberalismo-y-retirada-del-estado</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-crisis-economica-provocada-por-decadas-de-neoliberalismo-y-retirada-del-estado</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El obispo de Mallorca critica la contradicción de rechazar a migrantes pobres mientras se acoge a millones de turistas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El obispo de Mallorca, Sebastià Taltavull, nacido en Menorca, ha expresado en una entrevista con Efe su profunda indignación ante la actitud de algunos cristianos que rechazan acoger a migrantes llegados en pateras, a los que considera entre los más pobres y necesitados. Taltavull ha recordado el mandato evangélico «era forastero y me acogisteis» y ha cuestionado la diferencia de trato: mientras se reciben sin obstáculos millones de turistas cada año por su rentabilidad económica, se pone resistencia a acoger a unas 7.000 personas llegadas en embarcaciones precarias, muchas de ellas tras sufrir grandes penalidades.

El obispo ha defendido que toda persona vulnerable merece acogida inmediata y ha propuesto crear una mesa de diálogo para la paz, la inclusión y la convivencia, en la que participen instituciones y personas de distintas ideologías, incluso creyentes de varios partidos políticos, con la fe como denominador común.

Estos componentes, prohibidos en el mercado estadounidense y presuntamente importados de forma ilegal, se han instalado en vehículos reparados tras siniestros previos, principalmente en modelos como Chevrolet Malibu y Hyundai Sonata, aunque el riesgo no se limita a estas marcas.

El fallo consiste en que, al activarse, los infladores se rompen y expulsan fragmentos metálicos a gran velocidad hacia el conductor, afectando pecho, cuello, ojos y rostro. Hasta el momento, se han documentado diez incidentes con este patrón, resultando en ocho fallecidos y dos heridos graves en colisiones que, de otro modo, habrían sido sobrevivibles con airbags originales certificados.

Dos trenes de alta velocidad descarrilaron a las 19:45 horas, provocando la muerte de al menos 39 personas y dejando más de 150 heridos de diversa consideración. El suceso se produjo cuando un tren AV Iryo procedente de Málaga descarriló en los desvíos de entrada a la estación e invadió la vía contigua, por la que circulaba un tren Alvia con destino Huelva desde Madrid Puerta de Atocha. Como consecuencia del impacto, ambos convoyes descarrilaron.

La peor parte del choque la sufrieron los dos primeros vagones del tren Alvia, que cayeron por un terraplén de unos cuatro metros. En esas unidades viajaban 53 pasajeros de los aproximadamente 200 que iban a bordo. Los servicios de emergencia desplegaron un amplio operativo en la zona, instalando un hospital de campaña en el que se atendió a unos 170 heridos leves, mientras q]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/choque-y-descarrilamiento-de-dos-trenes-de-alta-velocidad-en-adamuz-deja-al-menos-39-fallecidos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/choque-y-descarrilamiento-de-dos-trenes-de-alta-velocidad-en-adamuz-deja-al-menos-39-fallecidos</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Osprey V, la banda de rock de Gaza, depende de la embajada española para participar en el concierto solidario por Palestina en Barcelona]]></title><description><![CDATA[La banda palestina Osprey V, considerada la primera banda de rock surgida en la Franja de Gaza, se encuentra a la espera de que la embajada de España active el artículo 38 de la Ley 12/2009 sobre asilo y protección subsidiaria.

Esta declaración viene acompañada de una reevaluación de la propiedad de Groenlandia, cuestionando la titularidad danesa y acusando a Dinamarca de no haber abordado las amenazas rusas en la isla. Trump también ha vinculado su frustración con expectativas para la OTAN, exigiendo más compromiso por parte de la alianza. La Unión Europea está considerando medidas económicas para contrarrestar la presión política ejercida por Trump, quien ha intensificado sus acusaciones a través de la plataforma Truth Social.

Sanz ha usado expresiones controvertidas para referirse a ecolojetas, al genocidio de Gaza y a figuras políticas, lo que le ha llevado a tensiones con autoridades regionales y con algunos miembros del episcopado. Su sintonía con Vox y la defensa de símbolos históricos como Covadonga refuerzan su imagen de líder religioso con un enfoque político marcado.

Esta fortuna conjunta supera la riqueza total poseída por cerca de 18,7 millones de personas, es decir, casi el 40% de la población española. De media, cada uno de estos 33 superricos ganó más de 77 millones de euros diarios durante 2025.

Un tren Iryo 6189, que cubría la ruta Málaga-Puerta de Atocha con aproximadamente 300 pasajeros a bordo, descarriló en los desvíos de entrada a la vía 1 de Adamuz, invadiendo la vía contigua. En ese momento circulaba en sentido contrario un tren Alvia de Renfe (2384 Puerta de Atocha-Huelva), que también descarriló tras el impacto. Varios vagones del Alvia cayeron por un talud de unos cuatro metros de altura, lo que complicó enormemente las labores de rescate.

La trama se desarrolla en un mundo donde los habitantes han sido absorbidos por una mente colmena llamada 'La Unión', dejando a unos pocos inmunes, entre ellos Carol. La serie explora la supervivencia y la individualidad en un entorno global unificado, planteando preguntas sobre la humanidad y la libertad, aunque lo hace con un tono ligero y pausado que evita la densidad excesiva de otras obras del género. 'Pluribus' se sostiene casi exclusivamente sobre la actuación de Seehorn, que da vida a un personaje complejo capaz de mantener la atención en cada escena. La crítica destaca la capacidad de Gilligan para equilibrar misterio, ciencia ficción y desarrollo de personajes, ofreciendo una narrativa absorbente sin sacrificar claridad ni ritmo.

El siniestro se produjo cuando un tren de alta velocidad de la compañía Iryo descarriló por causas aún desconocidas. Como consecuencia del descarrilamiento, varios de los últimos coches quedaron atravesados en la vía, lo que provocó la colisión de un tren Alvia que circulaba en sentido Madrid-Huelva.

El impacto afectó especialmente a los dos primeros vagones del Alvia, que salieron despedidos y cayeron por un terraplén de unos cuatro metros de altura. En esos dos coches viajaban 56 personas, concentrándose en ellos la mayoría de las víctimas mortales y los heridos de mayor gravedad. Hasta la una de la madrugada se habían confirmado 21 fallecidos, aunque el ministro subrayó que la cifra no podía darse aún por definitiva.

Cuando la presentadora Margaret Brennan le preguntó por el estado de salud de Ross, supuestamente con hemorragia interna según un informe de CBS, Noem respondió: 'No digas su nombre', argumentando que hacerlo equivaldría a doxxing a los agentes de la ley y contribuye a un supuesto aumento del 8.000 % en las amenazas de muerte contra ellos.

Noem insistió en que, aunque el nombre de Ross es público, no debería seguir mencionándose, y afirmó que tanto él como su familia están en peligro. También defendió la actuación del agente, asegurando que Good intentó atropellarle con su coche, pese a que varios vídeos muestran que el vehículo nunca llegó a contactar con Ross.

Se estima que alrededor del 40% de la población mundial actual (especialmente en zonas costeras y deltas) tendría que desplazarse masivamente. Los impactos variarían por continentes: Europa perdería Países Bajos, Dinamarca y grandes zonas de Alemania, Bélgica y varias capitales (Londres, Berlín, Barcelona, Venecia…); Asia sería la más afectada con más de 2.000 millones de personas en riesgo y la desaparición de ciudades como Shanghái, Bombay, Tokio o Bangkok, además de la virtual desaparición de Bangladés.

Según Escobar, se han utilizado terminales Starlink de contrabando para mantener la coordinación pese al apagón de internet, y los líderes habrían sido entrenados en Polonia, Georgia y otros lugares durante más de 18 meses. El verdadero objetivo sería destruir el corredor energético euroasiático clave que une Rusia, Irán y China, rompiendo así la arquitectura multipolar en construcción durante los últimos 15 años.

Personal militar estadounidense, probablemente presente en la propia isla, contactó directamente con colegas daneses en Groenlandia para obtener estos datos sobre infraestructura crítica.

Los síntomas se agravaron durante la madrugada, cuando intentó salir a correr como es habitual en él, y le impidieron continuar con su agenda oficial, incluyendo una visita prevista en Ascó. Tras ser trasladado en ambulancia, los médicos realizaron un TAC y dos resonancias magnéticas en menos de 24 horas, descartando patologías graves como ictus, problemas vasculares, tumorales o medulares.

Kapuściński describe un sistema marcado por el terror de la Savak, la policía secreta omnipresente con decenas de miles de agentes y millones de informadores, que generaba una paranoia extrema en la sociedad: los ciudadanos evitaban palabras cotidianas por miedo a ser interpretadas como críticas al régimen. El texto destaca cómo el boom petrolero trajo una inmensa riqueza que el país no pudo gestionar: faltaban infraestructuras, profesionales cualificados y se priorizaba la importación de expertos extranjeros mientras el talento iraní emigraba. Gran parte del dinero se dilapidó en armamento sofisticado que nadie sabía utilizar y en corrupción masiva entre altos cargos, mini]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-sha-o-la-desmesura-del-poder-la-cronica-de-kapuscinski-sobre-la-corrupcion-y-represion-del-regimen-del-ultimo-sah-de-iran</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-sha-o-la-desmesura-del-poder-la-cronica-de-kapuscinski-sobre-la-corrupcion-y-represion-del-regimen-del-ultimo-sah-de-iran</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:15:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Francisco Granados se enfrenta a juicio por presuntas irregularidades en contratos de fiestas populares en la pieza 7 de Púnica]]></title><description><![CDATA[Francisco Granados, exsecretario general del PP de Madrid y ex mano derecha de Esperanza Aguirre, comienza este lunes 18 de enero de 2026 en la Audiencia Nacional el juicio correspondiente a la pieza séptima de la trama Púnica. Junto a él se sientan en el banquillo el exsenador David Erguido y otras doce personas. Los hechos investigados se remontan a los años 2007-2010 y giran en torno a la presunta adjudicación irregular de contratos para la organización de fiestas populares en varios municipios madrileños (Valdemoro, Algete, Ciempozuelos, Moraleja de Enmedio y Móstoles) a la empresa Waiter Music y otras sociedades vinculadas a José Luis Huerta (fallecido).

Según las acusaciones, a cambio de estas adjudicaciones, la empresa realizaba sin coste alguno diversos actos y eventos del Partido Popular, así como algunos servicios privados para políticos o sus familias.

El objetivo declarado es establecer una gobernanza temporal en el enclave, promover la reconstrucción y consolidar la paz en Oriente Próximo mediante un enfoque innovador para resolver conflictos globales.

La carta de invitación, compartida inicialmente en X por el presidente argentino Javier Milei, describe al consejo como una organización honorífica destinada a países dispuestos a invertir en un futuro seguro y próspero.

El autor subraya que, pese a casi 50 años de sanciones, injerencias, operaciones encubiertas y presiones económicas, la República Islámica no ha colapsado, sino que se mantiene como un elemento central en el nuevo orden multipolar junto a Rusia, China y los BRICS.

Se explica que las recientes protestas en Irán (finales de 2025 y principios de 2026) tienen su origen principal en reivindicaciones económicas, particularmente en la revuelta de sectores del bazar contra las medidas gubernamentales que pretendían reducir los privilegios de las élites y la economía paralela derivada del tipo de cambio preferencial. Estas demandas fueron aprovechadas por grupos monárquicos, pro-occidentales y muy marginalmente izquierdistas, pero las protestas se mantuvieron dispersas y sin liderazgo unificado.

Con el 97% de los votos escrutados, Seguro obtuvo el 30,8% de los sufragios, mientras que Ventura alcanzó el 23,9%, confirmando el avance del populismo de derechas en el país vecino.

Los resultados suponen un duro golpe para la coalición de centroderecha que gobierna Portugal, Alianza Democrática. Su candidato, el exministro Luís Marquês Mendes, respaldado de forma explícita por el primer ministro Luís Montenegro, se hundió hasta la quinta posición con apenas un 11,7% de los votos. Por delante de él quedaron otros candidatos conservadores y liberales, lo que evidencia la fragmentación del espacio de la derecha tradicional y el ascenso de Chega como principal referente de ese bloque.

La empresa solicita como medida cautelar la suspensión de estos préstamos, destinados a financiar dos programas clave de obuses autopropulsados —de ruedas y de cadenas— para la modernización del Ejército de Tierra, dentro de la estrategia de rearme europeo.

En 1759, en plena Guerra de los Siete Años, Étienne de Silhouette fue nombrado ministro de Finanzas (controlador general). Ante la grave crisis económica del país, implementó medidas de austeridad impopulares: recortó gastos, redujo pensiones, impuso nuevos impuestos e incluso gravó artículos de lujo y a la nobleza. Estas políticas provocaron un fuerte rechazo social, convirtiendo su apellido en sinónimo de tacañería, barato y poco lujoso. En esa misma época, se popularizaron en Francia los retratos de perfil recortados en cartulina negra, una técnica mucho más económica que los retratos al óleo tradicionales. La sociedad francesa, en tono burlón, comenzó a denominarlos 'retratos a la Silhouette', asociándolos con lo barato y sencillo, en alusión sarcástica a las medidas del ministro.

Un conjunto de mapas elaborados por ESPON, el programa europeo dedicado al análisis de la cohesión territorial, permite visualizar con claridad hasta qué punto existen grandes desigualdades regionales dentro de la Unión Europea.

Para su análisis, ESPON ha cruzado datos de precios de compraventa y alquiler con estadísticas de ingresos de Eurostat, siempre a escala regional. A partir de ahí, se han calculado indicadores como el tamaño de la vivienda que puede permitirse una persona destinando el 40% de sus ingresos al alquiler, o qué porcentaje de su renta sería necesario para arrendar un piso estándar de 100 metros cuadrados.

La operación se produjo poco después de que Netflix anunciara un acuerdo para adquirir Warner Bros Discovery por unos 82.700 millones de dólares, una fusión que aún debe ser aprobada por los organismos reguladores estadounidenses.

El fenómeno no se limita únicamente a los más jóvenes. Entre los ciudadanos de 30 a 44 años, tradicionalmente más equilibrados en su reparto de voto, la derecha también se aproxima a la mayoría absoluta, con un 49,3 % de apoyo conjunto.

Diversos expertos coinciden en que la llamada ‘pax americana’ ha llegado a su fin y que la estrategia de Trump, basada en la fuerza, las amenazas y el unilateralismo, responde a la pérdida de control económico y tecnológico frente a potencias emergentes como China y al auge de los BRICS. Este renovado imperialismo no busca tanto la conquista territorial como asegurar monopolios estratégicos, especialmente en el ámbito tecnológico y energético.

El texto subraya que la relación entre EEUU y la UE ya no puede entenderse como una alianza basada en la confianza.

El Cabildo de La Gomera activó de forma preventiva los sistemas de emergencias y mantuvo contacto constante con Endesa, el Gobierno de Canarias y el Gobierno central. A las 15:25 horas, el suministro se había restablecido completamente al 100%, aunque se avisó de posibles pequeños cortes puntuales por labores de ajuste y mantenimiento. Las causas exactas del incidente aún se investigan, aunque se apunta a una desestabilización de un generador. Este episodio contrasta con el grave cero energético de julio de 2023, que duró más de 60 horas y derivó en una multa de 12,1 millones de euros a Unelco (Endesa) por infracción m]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-gomera-recupera-el-suministro-electrico-al-100-tras-un-breve-cero-energetico-de-17-minutos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-gomera-recupera-el-suministro-electrico-al-100-tras-un-breve-cero-energetico-de-17-minutos</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:32:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Banco de España alcanza un récord histórico en el valor de sus reservas de oro y divisas]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Banco de España cerró el año 2025 con un valor récord en sus reservas de oro y divisas, que superaron los 94.000 millones de euros, el nivel más alto desde que existen registros comparables, iniciados en 1999. Según la estadística de financiación del Eurosistema, actualizada recientemente, en diciembre estas reservas alcanzaron los 94.209 millones de euros, lo que supone un incremento mensual de 479 millones y un aumento interanual de más de 7.600 millones.

Este crecimiento no se explica por un aumento en la cantidad de oro adquirida, sino principalmente por la fuerte revalorización del metal precioso en los mercados internacionales. Durante 2025, el oro vivió un ejercicio excepcional, con una subida cercana al 65% que llevó su cotización hasta los 4.350 dólares por onza. En las primeras semanas de 2026, la tendencia alcista continuó y el precio alcanzó nuevos máximos históricos en torno a los 4.600 dólares por onza, impulsado por un contexto internacional marcado por tensiones geo]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-banco-de-espana-alcanza-un-record-historico-en-el-valor-de-sus-reservas-de-oro-y-divisas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-banco-de-espana-alcanza-un-record-historico-en-el-valor-de-sus-reservas-de-oro-y-divisas</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:26:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El HOMENAJE a ORTEGA LARA que BILDU NO QUIERE QUE VEAS]]></title><description><![CDATA[El vídeo muestra un homenaje a Carlos Ortega Lara, un policía nacional fallecido en acto de servicio.

El texto cuestiona la imagen de integridad que Rubio ha proyectado a lo largo de su carrera política pese a estos vínculos. Se argumenta que, como figura clave en la administración Trump, Rubio promueve una política exterior en América Latina que apoya a líderes controvertidos con presuntos nexos con el narcotráfico (como Daniel Noboa, Juan Orlando Hernández, Nayib Bukele, Javier Milei, José Antonio Kast y Álvaro Uribe), mientras impulsa acciones de fuerza contra Venezuela bajo la acusación del 'Cártel de los Soles'.

La campaña surge como respuesta satírica a las reiteradas declaraciones de Trump sobre su deseo de apropiarse de Groenlandia, territorio autónomo bajo soberanía danesa. A través de una plataforma digital, los impulsores de la iniciativa plantean la compra de California como un gesto provocador que pone en evidencia lo absurdo de tratar territorios y poblaciones como simples activos comerciales.

El movimiento, presentado con un tono claramente humorístico, invita a imaginar una Dinamarca con sol, playas, palmeras y patines, en contraste con el clima nórdico.

Según un análisis destacado por CNN y recogido en HuffPost, el presidente estadounidense busca no solo ventajas estratégicas, sino también un legado personal de expansión territorial similar al de presidentes históricos como Jefferson o McKinley. Groenlandia es clave por su posición en el Atlántico Norte y el Ártico, la base militar estadounidense ya existente, las nuevas rutas marítimas abiertas por el deshielo y sus abundantes recursos naturales como tierras raras, minerales críticos y posibles hidrocarburos.

Los informes médicos indican que sufrió aplastamiento de vejiga y uretra, así como daños en otros tejidos internos, lo que la llevó a permanecer en terapia intensiva con pronóstico grave. La menor llegó acompañada por un joven de unos 18 años que se presentó como su “esposo”, pero abandonó el hospital tras el ingreso y su paradero es actualmente desconocido.

Además, se prevé que un tercio de estos conductores se jubilen en los próximos diez años, agravando la situación debido al progresivo envejecimiento del colectivo, concentrado mayoritariamente entre los 45 y 55 años.

Para abordar este problema, la asociación andaluza de transportistas USINTRA y la Fundación Campus de Córdoba han firmado un Protocolo de Colaboración con el Ministerio de Trabajo y Seguridad Social de Turquía. Este acuerdo, que se ejecutará a través de la Agencia Turca de Empleo, busca reclutar a parte de los más de 300.000 conductores de camión que, según estimaciones del Gobierno turco, están en busca de empleo en su país.

El proceso incluye el traslado de los seleccionados a España, su formación p]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/protocolo-de-colaboracion-entre-espana-y-turquia-para-reclutar-y-formar-conductores-de-camion-turcos-ante-la-escasez-en-el-sector-del-transporte</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/protocolo-de-colaboracion-entre-espana-y-turquia-para-reclutar-y-formar-conductores-de-camion-turcos-ante-la-escasez-en-el-sector-del-transporte</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:48:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nieves Concostrina desmonta el blanqueamiento mediático de Irene de Grecia y los privilegios de la monarquía]]></title><description><![CDATA[La columna de Nieves Concostrina parte de un gesto de empatía personal hacia la exreina Sofía por la muerte de su hermana Irene de Grecia, a quien define como su principal apoyo emocional durante décadas marcadas por humillaciones y traiciones de Juan Carlos I. Desde ese reconocimiento humano inicial, la autora desarrolla una crítica contundente al relato edulcorado que numerosos medios han difundido tras el fallecimiento de Irene, presentándola como una figura excéntrica y admirable con una “vida fascinante”.

Concostrina cuestiona ese encuadre y lo sitúa en el contexto de los privilegios estructurales de la monarquía. Repasa el origen de la familia real griega, su escasa legitimidad social y su caída definitiva tras el apoyo del rey Constantino II a la dictadura militar, así como el papel de figuras como Federica de Grecia, vinculada al nazismo y al derroche. En ese marco, analiza cómo Irene de Grecia acabó instalada en la Zarzuela a costa del erario público, disfrutando durante déca]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nieves-concostrina-desmonta-el-blanqueamiento-mediatico-de-irene-de-grecia-y-los-privilegios-de-la-monarquia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/nieves-concostrina-desmonta-el-blanqueamiento-mediatico-de-irene-de-grecia-y-los-privilegios-de-la-monarquia</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:38:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Centro de Detención Metropolitano de Brooklyn: condiciones denunciadas mientras alberga a Nicolás Maduro y otros reclusos de alto perfil]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tras una controvertida operación militar estadounidense en Caracas el 3 de enero de 2026, Nicolás Maduro, expresidente de Venezuela, y su esposa Cilia Flores fueron capturados y trasladados al Centro de Detención Metropolitano (MDC) en Brooklyn, Nueva York. Este centro penitenciario federal, conocido por albergar a acusados de alto perfil en espera de juicio en el distrito este de Nueva York, ha acogido en los últimos años a figuras como Sean “Diddy” Combs, Ghislaine Maxwell, Sam Bankman-Fried, Luigi Mangione (acusado del asesinato del CEO de UnitedHealthcare) y otros como El Chapo o R.

Abogados defensores y jueces federales han denunciado reiteradamente las condiciones del MDC como inseguras e inhumanas: hacinamiento, escasez de personal, violencia (incluido un homicidio en 2024 y varios suicidios), contaminación en la comida, instalaciones sucias, presencia de drogas y cierres prolongados.

Al día siguiente, apareció vandalizada la tumba homenaje a las Trece Rosas en el cementerio de La Almudena, con pintadas que incluían el nombre de Santaolalla junto a 'RIP', interpretado como una clara amenaza de muerte.

Fuentes del Partido Popular consultadas por el medio justifican en parte este clima de hostilidad porque Santaolalla, en un debate televisivo, se refirió al grupo musical Hakuna —banda favorita de Isabel Díaz Ayuso— como 'pijos' y 'ultras', considerándolo una afrenta grave.

Este despliegue, inicialmente orientado a operaciones en Europa y el Mediterráneo, se extendió hacia el Caribe y el área de responsabilidad del Comando Sur (SOUTHCOM), donde ha participado en misiones de interdicción marítima contra el narcotráfico y otras actividades ilícitas en la región.

El almirante al mando y altos oficiales navales, incluido el Jefe de Operaciones Navales (CNO), han advertido que prolongar aún más esta misión supone graves riesgos tanto para el mantenimiento del buque como para el bienestar de la tripulación. Los tiempos de despliegue habituales se han superado con creces, lo que podría afectar la preparación general del grupo de ataque, generar problemas logísticos y tensiones en el personal.

Rufián utilizó sus redes sociales para cuestionar el significado político y moral de ese gesto, señalando que, aunque pueda resultar chocante o incluso ridículo, existen precedentes históricos similares.

En concreto, el diputado recordó el caso del escritor noruego Knut Hamsun, quien en 1942 entregó su Premio Nobel al dirigente nazi Joseph Goebbels, pese a que la Alemania nazi había invadido Noruega. Con esta comparación, Rufián subrayó que los símbolos, premios y reconocimientos pueden ser instrumentalizados políticamente, incluso en contextos que contradicen los valores que supuestamente representan.

Ofrece petróleo venezolano para bajar los precios del crudo a unos 50 dólares por barril, beneficiando a consumidores estadounidenses y a las grandes petroleras.

Se critica el embargo previo impuesto por Trump, que destruyó gran parte de la infraestructura petrolera venezolana al convertir el crudo superpesado en material inutilizable.

Durante la emisión, Webbon dio espacio a Fuentes para cuestionar el llamado consenso de posguerra, basado en el rechazo al fascismo y al antisemitismo tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Fuentes calificó este consenso como un “mito fundacional” que, según él, sirve para impedir formas de nacionalismo excluyente y cohesionadas como la Alemania nazi, defendiendo una visión basada en el orgullo racial, nacional y religioso.

En el transcurso de la charla, Webbon afirmó que el cine y la cultura popular han exagerado deliberadamente la figura de Hitler para convertirlo en el mayor villano de la historia y llegó a sostener que las atrocidades del Holocausto “probablemente no fueron tan graves como nos han contado”, insinuando además que Hitler no tenía conocimiento directo de lo que ocur]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-pastor-nacionalista-cristiano-y-un-influencer-neonazi-minimizan-el-holocausto-y-blanquean-el-fascismo</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-pastor-nacionalista-cristiano-y-un-influencer-neonazi-minimizan-el-holocausto-y-blanquean-el-fascismo</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:24:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La fragmentación de viviendas dispara el alquiler por habitaciones y agrava la crisis habitacional]]></title><description><![CDATA[La crisis de la vivienda en España ha entrado en una nueva fase marcada por la especulación habitación a habitación. Ante la escasez y los elevados precios de los pisos completos, muchos propietarios están optando por fragmentar las viviendas y alquilar cada habitación por separado, incluso eliminando espacios comunes como el salón o la cocina. Esta práctica, lejos del modelo tradicional de piso compartido, se ha convertido en una estrategia para maximizar beneficios en un mercado con una demanda desbordada.

Los datos reflejan la magnitud del problema: en el último año, la oferta de habitaciones ha aumentado un 25%, pero sus precios se han disparado un 43%. Actualmente, por cada habitación disponible hay 22 personas interesadas, y el precio medio supera ya los 500 euros mensuales, una cifra que hace una década equivalía al alquiler de un piso completo. Además, el perfil del inquilino ha cambiado: ya no son solo estudiantes, sino también adultos de entre 36 y 45 años que no pueden acce]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fragmentacion-de-viviendas-dispara-el-alquiler-por-habitaciones-y-agrava-la-crisis-habitacional</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-fragmentacion-de-viviendas-dispara-el-alquiler-por-habitaciones-y-agrava-la-crisis-habitacional</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La autora del intento de asesinato con raticida será juzgada por un nuevo ataque con ácido a su expareja]]></title><description><![CDATA[Ana María O., vecina de Astorga de 39 años, volverá a sentarse en el banquillo de los acusados por un nuevo y grave episodio de violencia contra su expareja, Marcos, a quien ya intentó asesinar en 2020. En aquel primer ataque, introdujo un potente raticida en un trozo de chocolate que hizo llegar a la víctima a través de uno de sus hijos menores. Marcos sobrevivió de manera casi milagrosa tras más de 700 días de recuperación y varios ingresos en la UCI, pero quedó con secuelas irreversibles: ceguera casi total, graves problemas de movilidad y deterioro neurológico. En mayo de 2025, Ana María O. fue condenada a 12 años y medio de prisión y al pago de más de 822.000 euros de indemnización, cantidad que la víctima no ha llegado a percibir.

Desde hace casi dos años, los operadores de telecomunicaciones están obligados a aplicar bloqueos de IP a petición de LaLiga, basándose en listados que la propia organización envía de forma periódica. El problema, señalan los expertos en ciberseguridad, es que estas IP suelen pertenecer a infraestructuras compartidas, como Cloudflare, lo que provoca que páginas legales y de uso cotidiano queden inaccesibles durante jornadas ligueras.

Feu sostiene que la prohibición de la especulación inmobiliaria no es una idea novedosa, sino un mandato constitucional recogido en el artículo 47 de la Constitución, que obliga a todas las administraciones a impedir la especulación en materia de vivienda. Según el urbanista, el problema actual no reside en el pequeño propietario tradicional, sino en la entrada masiva de grandes fondos y dinámicas globales que han convertido la vivienda en un activo financiero altamente rentable, expulsando a amplias capas de la población del mercado.

Además, ha calificado esa hipotética anexión como 'la carta de defunción de la OTAN', al erosionar gravemente la credibilidad y unidad de la alianza atlántica.

Según el autor, Trump ha intentado presentarse discursivamente como quien controla el destino político del país caribeño, llegando incluso a autoproclamarse “presidente interino” y a sugerir que Delcy Rodríguez gobierna gracias a su aval. 

El texto sostiene que esta narrativa carece de sustento real. Lejos de ser el resultado de una elección o de un plan cuidadosamente diseñado por Washington, el ascenso de Rodríguez habría sido una consecuencia imprevista del fracaso de la operación estadounidense.

El vuelo tuvo lugar alrededor de las 08:00 UTC y permitió que la cápsula alcanzara un apogeo aproximado de 120 kilómetros, superando la línea de Kármán, considerada la frontera del espacio. La separación de la cápsula ocurrió a unos 75 km de altitud tras 104 segundos de vuelo, y esta desplegó paracaídas alrededor de los 70 km para realizar un aterrizaje seguro a unos 170 km al oeste del punto de lanzamiento. Durante la misión, la cápsula proporcionó aproximadamente cinco minutos de microgravedad a diversas cargas útiles, entre las que destacaban experimentos científicos y semillas de rosales para estudios de mutación genética inducida por el ambiente espacial.

Ambientada en un Oslo futuro próximo, narra la historia de una joven arquitecta que, ante la imposibilidad de acceder a una vivienda digna por la escalada de precios inmobiliarios, termina viviendo en un aparcamiento subterráneo convertido en refugio comunitario. La trama combina sátira social con elementos distópicos, explorando la precariedad laboral en estudios de arquitectura, el sexismo, la presión comercial versus la vocación artística y la creciente desigualdad en el acceso a la vivienda.

En la entrevista a los guionistas Nora Landsrød y Kristian Kilde, se destaca que la idea surgió de experiencias personales reales, como la frustración de solo poder permitirse una plaza de garaje en el mercado inmobiliario. Abordan cómo el problema de la vivienda es global, especialmente grave para los jóvenes, y cómo en Nor]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entrevista-a-los-creadores-de-the-architect-satira-sobre-la-crisis-de-vivienda-y-la-profesion-de-arquitecto-en-un-futuro-cercano</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/entrevista-a-los-creadores-de-the-architect-satira-sobre-la-crisis-de-vivienda-y-la-profesion-de-arquitecto-en-un-futuro-cercano</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:55:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Barcelona actualiza la Ordenanza de Convivencia con multas más elevadas por incivismo a partir del 15 de febrero de 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Ayuntamiento de Barcelona pondrá en marcha el 15 de febrero de 2026 la nueva Ordenanza de medidas para fomentar y garantizar la convivencia ciudadana en el espacio público, que actualiza la norma de civismo vigente desde 2006.

Este cese de hostilidades, el cuarto negociado por el organismo, tiene como objetivo principal permitir las reparaciones en la última línea eléctrica de reserva de 330 kilovoltios, que quedó fuera de servicio tras los ataques registrados el 2 de enero de 2026. Desde entonces, la planta depende exclusivamente de una única línea principal de 750 kilovoltios, lo que incrementa considerablemente los riesgos para la seguridad nuclear.

La central, ubicada en Enerhodar y bajo control ruso desde marzo de 2022, lleva en parada fría desde entonces debido a problemas de refrigeración y cortes de suministro eléctrico.

En la ciudad principal, Petropávlovsk de Kamchatka, con unos 160.000 habitantes, las acumulaciones han alcanzado hasta dos o tres metros de altura en algunas calles, sepultando viviendas, bloqueando accesos a edificios y provocando el colapso de tejados por el peso de la nieve.

Como consecuencia, dos hombres han fallecido: un hombre de 60 años fue encontrado bajo un alud de nieve desprendido de un tejado mientras se limpiaba un patio, y otro residente murió en circunstancias similares al quedar atrapado por la nieve caída de otro tejado. Ante esta situación, el gobernador regional, Yevgueni Beliáev, decretó el estado de emergencia el viernes 16 de enero, con el objetivo de movilizar recursos adicionales para la limpieza y recuperación.

Tras ser detenido por segunda vez por conducir bajo los efectos del alcohol, Phelps atravesó una profunda depresión en la que llegó a desear no estar vivo, sintiendo que había decepcionado a su familia, amigos y a sí mismo. El deportista se encerró durante días, apenas comía y evitaba el contacto humano, comunicándose solo por mensajes.

Finalmente decidió ingresar voluntariamente en un centro de tratamiento, aunque los primeros días fueron de gran resistencia y miedo. Con el tiempo, cambió su actitud y se implicó totalmente en el proceso terapéutico. Allí enfrentó traumas de infancia como la ausencia de su padre, el diagnóstico de TDAH, la enorme presión acumulada y su tendencia a reprimir emociones durante años.

En 1940, se estimaban unas 20.000 personas sin hogar en la capital. En marzo de 1941, se inauguró un albergue provisional para mendigos en las naves del Matadero municipal (hoy espacio cultural), con capacidad para 3.000 personas, adaptadas en solo 20 días a partir de cuadras para ganado. Las condiciones eran inhumanas: dormían sobre paja, sin colchones ni ropa adecuada, enfrentando temperaturas medias de 6 grados y un duro invierno. La mayoría no eran mendigos profesionales, sino personas empobrecidas por la guerra, la destrucción de viviendas, epidemias y la represión contra quienes habían apoyado a la República.

Durante décadas, Nielsen fue un actor dramático de presencia hierática, voz profunda y físico de galán clásico, habitual en series y películas de los años cincuenta a setenta, como Planeta prohibido o La aventura del Poseidón. Trabajó sin descanso, pero sin destacar especialmente en una industria saturada de intérpretes similares.

Todo cambió cuando ya había superado los cincuenta años y fue elegido por el trío Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker para Aterriza como puedas. La clave de aquella comedia era que los actores se tomaran en serio situaciones completamente absurdas, y Nielsen encajó a la perfección.

En primer lugar, un cohete Larga Marcha 3B/E despegó desde Xichang a las 04:08 UTC del 16 de enero llevando el satélite Shijian 32 (probablemente militar y destinado a órbita geoestacionaria), pero sufrió un fallo en la tercera etapa criogénica, perdiéndose la misión. Este incidente rompe la racha perfecta de 69 lanzamientos exitosos del Larga Marcha en todo 2025.

Horas después, el cohete Ceres 2 de la empresa privada Galactic Energy realizó su vuelo inaugural desde Jiuquan, también a las 04:08 UTC, pero no logró alcanzar órbita. El Ceres 2 es un lanzador de combustible sólido de tres etapas más una etapa superior líquida, diseñado para colocar hasta 2 toneladas en órbita baja, y representa un paso intermedio entre el pequeño Ceres 1 y el futuro Pallas 1 de mayor capacidad.

El primer ministro polaco, Donald Tusk, ha advertido que cualquier intento de un miembro de la OTAN de apoderarse de territorio de otro aliado supondría 'el fin del mundo tal como lo conocemos', al destruir la solidaridad fundamental de la alianza atlántica que ha mantenido la estabilidad frente a amenazas externas durante décadas. Polonia ha dejado claro que no participará en el despliegue de tropas europeas en Groenlandia. Por su parte, el senador ruso Dmitry Rogozin, aliado del Kremlin, ha calificado la maniobra estadounidense como el posible inicio del 'fin del mundo', argumentando que Groenlandia se utilizaría para desplegar sistemas de defensa antimisiles y armas estratégicas que otorgarían a EE.UU. superioridad nuclear sobre Rusia y China, desequilibrando la ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-intensifica-la-presion-para-anexionar-groenlandia-advertencias-de-crisis-en-la-otan-y-respuestas-de-rusia-y-polonia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/trump-intensifica-la-presion-para-anexionar-groenlandia-advertencias-de-crisis-en-la-otan-y-respuestas-de-rusia-y-polonia</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:21:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Expertos prevén la primera fábrica de coches totalmente automatizada sin humanos para 2030, probablemente en China o EE.UU.]]></title><description><![CDATA[La industria automovilística está avanzando rápidamente hacia una mayor automatización gracias a los progresos en robótica avanzada, inteligencia artificial y robots humanoides. Aunque los robots ya participan ampliamente en las líneas de producción de vehículos, el ensamblaje completo sin intervención humana (conocidas como 'dark factories') aún no es habitual, especialmente en tareas complejas como el cableado o el montaje interior.

Según expertos consultados por AutoNews, procedentes de Gartner y Warburg Research, se espera que al menos un fabricante alcance la automatización total del proceso de fabricación de coches para el año 2030. Este hito probablemente ocurrirá primero en China o Estados Unidos, gracias al rápido desarrollo tecnológico en estos países.

Los analistas destacan que 12 de los 25 principales fabricantes ya están realizando pruebas piloto con robótica avanzada, incluyendo humanoides.

Aunque su vida media en la atmósfera es más corta, su impacto a corto plazo lo convierte en un acelerador crítico del calentamiento global. Las emisiones de metano provienen tanto de fuentes naturales como de actividades humanas. Aproximadamente un 40% del metano atmosférico procede de fuentes naturales como humedales y procesos geológicos, mientras que el 60% restante tiene origen humano, principalmente en la agroganadería, la producción de arroz, la explotación de combustibles fósiles y la gestión de residuos. La ganadería de rumiantes genera metano por la digestión y la gestión del estiércol, mientras que el arroz produce emisiones significativas en campos inundados. Los combustibles fósiles también contribuyen con fugas y venteos, y los vertederos liberan metano por la descomposición a]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-metano-y-su-impacto-acelerado-en-el-calentamiento-global</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-metano-y-su-impacto-acelerado-en-el-calentamiento-global</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 06:29:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El Parlamento Europeo amenaza con paralizar el acuerdo comercial UE-EE.UU. ante las amenazas arancelarias de Trump por Groenlandia]]></title><description><![CDATA[La Unión Europea se encuentra en un momento de alta tensión con Estados Unidos debido a las recientes amenazas del presidente Donald Trump.

El acuerdo prevé la eliminación progresiva de aranceles para aproximadamente el 90% de los intercambios comerciales entre ambas regiones. Esto facilitará el acceso de productos industriales europeos —como maquinaria, vehículos y equipos eléctricos— a mercados sudamericanos tradicionalmente protegidos, mientras que los países del Mercosur se beneficiarán especialmente en el sector agropecuario, con mayores cuotas y menores barreras para sus exportaciones.

Según informó la Municipalidad de Gaza, los bombardeos han provocado fallos significativos en las principales líneas de suministro situadas al este de la ciudad, lo que ha interrumpido el acceso al agua potable para miles de viviendas y ha agravado las ya precarias condiciones de vida de la población.

En un comunicado difundido por medios palestinos, las autoridades municipales explicaron que sus equipos técnicos detectaron roturas importantes en las conducciones de agua, imposibilitando la distribución regular a amplias zonas urbanas. Esta situación se suma a un deterioro acumulado de la red hídrica desde el inicio de la ofensiva israelí sobre la Franja de Gaza en 2023, periodo en el que, según fuentes locales, se han destruido numerosas tuberías, depósitos de almacenamiento y pozos.

Durante su discurso de aceptación, entregado por Juliette Binoche, Ullmann bromeó inicialmente sobre su avanzada edad al mencionar que sus temblores se debían a los años y no a los nervios.

Sin embargo, el momento más destacado llegó cuando abordó con ironía y crítica la actualidad política internacional.

Las medidas comerciales, que prevén una subida del 10% a partir del 1 de febrero y del 25% desde el 1 de junio, están condicionadas explícitamente por Trump a la aceptación de su plan de compra y anexión de Groenlandia, una propuesta que ha generado un fuerte rechazo en Europa.

El presidente del Consejo Europeo, António Costa, ha subrayado que la UE actuará con firmeza en defensa del derecho internacional y de la integridad territorial de los Estados miembros. Sus declaraciones se produjeron durante la firma del acuerdo comercial entre la UE y Mercosur, un contexto que refuerza el mensaje europeo a favor del comercio multilateral frente a las presiones unilaterales y los aranceles como herramienta política.

Según Miller, Dinamarca, por su reducido tamaño económico y militar, 'no puede defender ni controlar' Groenlandia, y argumentó que, según principios históricos de control territorial de los últimos 500 años, una nación debe ser capaz de defender, mejorar y habitar un territorio para mantener su soberanía. Esta declaración contradice directamente el derecho internacional moderno, que prohíbe el uso de la fuerza contra la soberanía territorial de otros estados (salvo en legítima defensa o con autorización del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU) y consagra el respeto a las fronteras desde el Tratado de Westfalia de 1648.

El tema, elegido como Canción del Día por Jenesaispop, parte de una anécdota real: una cita concertada por redes sociales que termina revelando una profunda contradicción ideológica. La letra narra cómo alguien acaba acostándose con una persona de derechas y reflexiona, entre ironía y autocrítica, sobre esa excepción a una norma personal que el propio artista resume con la frase final: «aunque pases una mala racha, nunca tires a un facha».

Musicalmente, la canción comienza de forma acústica y evoluciona hacia un sonido post-punk con un puente de tintes metaleros, reforzando su carga expresiva.

Según un sondeo de CNN realizado por SSRS, cerca del 60 % de la población considera que este primer año ha sido un fracaso, mientras que su índice general de aprobación se sitúa en el 39 %, nueve puntos menos que un año antes. Además, una mayoría cree que Trump ha abusado de su poder presidencial y que se ha centrado en prioridades equivocadas.

El desgaste no se limita a la valoración personal del presidente, sino que afecta también a políticas que históricamente le eran favorables. En el ámbito económico, el 55 % de los encuestados opina que Trump ha empeorado la situación económica del país, y solo un 36 % cree que ha actuado sobre los asuntos adecuados. La encuesta de Associated Press–NORC refuerza esta tendencia y muestra una caída notable incluso entre votantes republicanos: solo el 16 % ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-encuestas-reflejan-un-fuerte-deterioro-del-apoyo-a-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/las-encuestas-reflejan-un-fuerte-deterioro-del-apoyo-a-trump-en-su-segundo-mandato</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:27:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG prepara un monitor ultrawide de 39 pulgadas con panel Tandem WOLED y resolución 5K2 (5120x2160) para el CES 2026]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo del blog 'Al otro lado del mostrador' presenta un nuevo monitor LG de 39 pulgadas con tecnología Tandem WOLED que se espera sea mostrado en el CES 2026. Este panel ofrece una resolución nativa de 5120 × 2160 píxeles (conocida como WUHD o 5K2), lo que proporciona mayor anchura que un monitor 4K estándar manteniendo la misma altura vertical, algo muy valorado por el autor, quien actualmente usa un antiguo monitor LG 4K IPS y busca una solución más amplia sin perder resolución vertical.

La tecnología Tandem WOLED mejora significativamente el brillo máximo, la duración del panel y la eficiencia energética en comparación con los OLED convencionales. Además, LG incorpora mejoras en la estructura de subpíxeles (pasando a un diseño Stripe que alinea los colores rojo, verde y azul en línea recta), lo que debería reducir los problemas habituales de reproducción de texto en pantallas OLED, ofreciendo mayor nitidez en interfaces y documentos.

El texto destaca que Trump no ha desvinculado sus negocios del cargo presidencial, a diferencia de otros mandatarios anteriores, y ha diversificado sus fuentes de ingresos de manera significativa. Entre los principales factores se encuentran el lanzamiento de criptomonedas como el 'memecoin' $TRUMP y $Melania, que han generado más de 1.000 millones, así como el valor de mercado de Truth Social (cerca de 2.000 millones), nuevas empresas como Trump Mobile y fusiones en energía nuclear.

El hecho resulta significativo no solo por la comparación entre un espacio informativo y unos dibujos animados, sino porque ambos canales pertenecen al mismo grupo, Mediaset.

En términos generales, Doraemon alcanzó un 8,4% de cuota de pantalla y 151.000 espectadores, frente al 6,9% y 117.000 que obtuvo La Mirada Crítica. La diferencia fue aún más relevante si se analiza el tramo de estricta coincidencia entre ambos espacios, de 07:59 a 08:40 horas, donde los dos episodios de la serie japonesa lograron un 7,3% de share y 124.000 espectadores, superando en siete décimas y unos 12.000 espectadores al programa producido por Unicorn Content.

El animal fue localizado atado, con las patas inmovilizadas mediante bridas de plástico y el hocico rodeado de cinta aislante, unas condiciones claramente incompatibles con su bienestar y que suponían un grave riesgo para su vida.

El hallazgo se produjo durante un servicio ordinario de vigilancia, cuando los agentes detectaron al perro en un estado que requería una intervención inmediata. Ante la gravedad de los hechos, se activó el protocolo correspondiente para garantizar la seguridad del animal y se solicitó la intervención de los servicios especializados.

Estas medidas se mantendrán hasta que se alcance un acuerdo para la 'compra completa y total' de Groenlandia.

Esta cifra supone un fuerte incremento respecto a 2021, cuando la mediana se situaba en 45 años, y contrasta de forma aún más llamativa con los datos de 1981, cuando la edad media de compra era de apenas 31 años. El principal factor que explica este cambio es la combinación de precios de la vivienda cada vez más elevados y tipos hipotecarios altos, que han dificultado el acceso a la propiedad para las generaciones más jóvenes.

El análisis de Apollo muestra cómo el mercado inmobiliario se ha ido desplazando progresivamente hacia compradores de mayor edad, con más ahorro acumulado y mayor capacidad para afrontar las condiciones financieras actuales. Mientras tanto, muchos jóvenes se ven obligados a retrasar la compra de su primera vivienda o directamente a permanecer en el mercado del alquiler durante más]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encarecimiento-de-la-vivienda-eleva-a-56-anos-la-edad-media-de-quienes-compran-casa</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-encarecimiento-de-la-vivienda-eleva-a-56-anos-la-edad-media-de-quienes-compran-casa</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 20:56:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[El fenómeno del 'rehoming' en las adopciones en Estados Unidos: la reubicación informal de menores adoptados]]></title><description><![CDATA[Este documental, emitido originalmente en el programa 'La Noche Temática' de RTVE y producido en Francia en 2016, aborda una dura realidad del sistema de adopciones en Estados Unidos: el llamado 'rehoming' o reasignación de hogar. Se trata de una práctica mediante la cual algunos padres adoptivos, tras haber adoptado legalmente a un menor (muchas veces con necesidades especiales o procedentes de adopciones internacionales), deciden transferir su custodia a otras personas sin apenas supervisión oficial. En la mayoría de los estados basta con un documento firmado ante un abogado para llevar a cabo esta transferencia, lo que puede derivar en situaciones muy peligrosas.

El reportaje destaca que una cuarta parte de los niños adoptados terminan siendo abandonados nuevamente por sus familias adoptivas, cifrando en alrededor de 25.000 los menores afectados cada año.

Iniciado en 2017, con una finalización prevista alrededor de 2025-2026, este megaproyecto busca trasladar agua desde el río Jinsha (afluente del Yangtsé) hacia el centro de la provincia de Yunnan, una región afectada por escasez hídrica crónica que limita el desarrollo urbano, agrícola e industrial.

La infraestructura incluye un total de 664 km de canales, de los cuales 612 km corresponden a túneles subterráneos excavados a través de montañas y terrenos complejos. Entre sus componentes destacan 58 túneles, 25 sifones invertidos, 17 acueductos y 15 pasos cubiertos de agua, diseñados para atravesar múltiples cuencas hidrográficas y superar grandes desafíos geológicos.

El suceso, ocurrido el 7 de enero, provocó una oleada de protestas en distintas ciudades del país, centradas en el uso de la fuerza por parte de agentes federales y en las políticas migratorias de la administración Trump.

Según Newsom, la respuesta del presidente a estas protestas no ha contribuido a rebajar la tensión, sino todo lo contrario. El gobernador californiano afirmó que Trump está “intentando avivar una guerra civil” y calificó de “vergonzosa” su actuación, especialmente en relación con los disturbios y manifestaciones en Minneapolis.

Otra organización, de origen colombiano, se encargaba de los asaltos a buques portacontenedores en alta mar, mientras que la tercera, asentada en el Campo de Gibraltar, proporcionaba la logística marítima con lanchas rápidas, combustible y apoyo operativo.

Entre los 30 detenidos destaca un guardia civil destinado en el Servicio Marítimo de Cádiz, conocido con el apodo de 'Cobe Bryant'.

Aunque la croqueta admite infinitas variaciones y suele asociarse al recuerdo doméstico —especialmente a las recetas familiares—, los datos confirman que los sabores tradicionales continúan dominando el gusto popular.

Según una encuesta realizada por una empresa especializada en productos croqueteros, el jamón ibérico se mantiene como el relleno favorito de forma clara, por delante de otras opciones muy extendidas como las croquetas de setas, pescado —con especial protagonismo del bacalao—, carnes, quesos, mariscos y verduras.

Según la versión oficial del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, el agente actuó en respuesta a lo que consideró un 'tirador activo', ya que Porter habría disparado un rifle, aunque su familia y activistas afirman que los tiros eran celebratorios al aire, una práctica habitual aunque ilegal en Nochevieja en algunas comunidades, y que no representaba una amenaza directa. La familia describe a Porter como una persona alegre, cariñosa y llena de vida, que 'llevaba alegría donde entraba' y siempre estaba sonriendo y bromeando.

Vance hizo estas declaraciones tras un tiroteo políticamente motivado en una instalación de ICE en Dallas (Texas), donde el atacante dejó escrito «Anti-ICE» en una vaina.

El vicepresidente señaló que para acabar con la violencia es necesario condenarla desde las más altas instancias del Partido Demócrata y dejar de calificar a la policía de frontera como «Gestapo». Recordó una serie de incidentes graves ocurridos en los últimos meses, como el asesinato del influyente conservador Charlie Kirk el 10 de septiembre de 2025, el tiroteo mortal contra la representante estatal demócrata de Minnesota Melissa Hortman y su marido en junio de 2025, y los dos intentos de ase]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jd-vance-pide-a-los-democratas-que-dejen-de-llamar-nazis-a-sus-opositores-para-reducir-la-violencia-politica</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/jd-vance-pide-a-los-democratas-que-dejen-de-llamar-nazis-a-sus-opositores-para-reducir-la-violencia-politica</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:01:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[La crisis de la vivienda en Ibiza expulsa también a residentes estables y familias ibicencas]]></title><description><![CDATA[La crisis del coste de vida y, especialmente, de la vivienda en Ibiza afecta no solo a trabajadores temporales o recién llegados, sino también a personas con empleo estable durante todo el año, familias con hijos y hasta ibicencos nacidos en la isla.

El lanzamiento se produjo el 14 de enero por orden del Juzgado de Primera Instancia número 100 de Madrid, a pesar de que la familia contaba con un informe de vulnerabilidad emitido por los servicios sociales que advertía de su situación de extrema precariedad.

La abuela se había hecho cargo de las menores desde el feminicidio y sostenía el hogar con unos ingresos mensuales de alrededor de 600 euros, una cantidad claramente insuficiente para acceder a una vivienda alternativa en el mercado actual. Según la Federación Regional de Asociaciones de Vecinos de Madrid (FRAVM), el desahucio evidencia un fallo grave del sistema de protección social y judicial, al no haberse paralizado ni aplazado la ejecución pese a la documentación existente.

Se centra en su novela 'Exilio interior', escrita en 1961 durante su exilio en Francia tras las protestas estudiantiles de 1956 en España. La obra, considerada un referente underground de la literatura antifranquista, combina elementos de novela picaresca y realismo social con humor negro, narrada desde la perspectiva de un niño que muestra la represión, el hambre, la corrupción del régimen y el papel de la Iglesia nacionalcatólica en la posguerra. Juana recuerda cómo la leyó de niña y el impacto que le causó. El libro tardó décadas en publicarse en España (hasta 1988) pese a su éxito internacional, y ha sido reeditado en 2025 por Hoja de Lata.

La propuesta fue expuesta por la directora general de Energía de la Comisión, Ditte Juul Jørgensen, durante su intervención en el Fórum Europa celebrado en Madrid. Según explicó, la carga impositiva que soporta la electricidad en España se sitúa ligeramente por encima de la media de la Unión Europea, lo que abre la puerta a replantear la fiscalidad aplicada a este suministro básico.

Jørgensen subrayó que, en muchos países de la UE, la factura eléctrica incorpora numerosos impuestos, cánones y conceptos que no están directamente relacionados con el consumo de energía, lo que encarece el recibo final para los consumidores. En este contexto, defendió que una reducción de la presión fiscal contribuiría a que la electrificación sea más competitiva frente a otras fuentes e]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comision-europea-sugiere-a-espana-reducir-la-fiscalidad-electrica-para-proteger-a-los-hogares-vulnerables</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/la-comision-europea-sugiere-a-espana-reducir-la-fiscalidad-electrica-para-proteger-a-los-hogares-vulnerables</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:06:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Análisis jurídico sobre la represión policial y judicial a activistas propalestinos en Alemania desde octubre de 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[El artículo, escrito por César Estirado, fiscal de Madrid y miembro de la Plataforma de Juristas por Palestina, denuncia la grave vulneración de derechos fundamentales que sufren en Alemania los activistas y manifestantes solidarios con la causa palestina.

Actualmente, los agentes recién incorporados superan en número a los veteranos, y la formación se limita a un curso online de cuatro semanas y otro presencial de ocho semanas.

El encuentro, celebrado en el despacho del regidor y difundido posteriormente a través de los canales oficiales del Ayuntamiento, se produce en un contexto marcado por el asedio sobre Gaza y las numerosas víctimas civiles que continúan registrándose pese a los anuncios de alto el fuego. La publicación del encuentro ha sido interpretada por distintos sectores como un gesto de respaldo institucional al Gobierno israelí en un momento especialmente sensible.

Málaga ha sido escenario en los últimos meses de múltiples movilizaciones ciudadanas en favor del fin de la violencia en Gaza y del respeto al derecho internacional humanitario. En este marco, la difusión pública de la reunión ha sido percibida por colectivos sociales y formaciones políticas como una provocación y una falta de sintoní]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/polemica-en-malaga-por-la-reunion-del-alcalde-con-la-embajadora-de-israel-durante-el-conflicto-en-gaza</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/polemica-en-malaga-por-la-reunion-del-alcalde-con-la-embajadora-de-israel-durante-el-conflicto-en-gaza</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:23:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Agentes de ICE detienen a tres trabajadores de un restaurante mexicano en Willmar horas después de comer allí]]></title><description><![CDATA[Agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) de Estados Unidos entraron alrededor de las 15:00 horas en el restaurante familiar El Tapatio, ubicado en Willmar (Minnesota), a unos 137 kilómetros al oeste de Minneapolis, donde comieron en una mesa como clientes normales. Testigos presenciales relataron que el personal se mostró visiblemente asustado durante su presencia. Horas más tarde, hacia las 20:30, después de que el establecimiento cerrara, varios agentes siguieron a los empleados y los detuvieron en las proximidades de una escuela secundaria y una iglesia luterana. Tres trabajadores fueron arrestados, aunque no se ha aclarado su identidad ni el motivo exacto de las detenciones.

Lejos de centrarse en el conflicto histórico, el grupo destaca por rapear en irlandés, un idioma que había caído en desuso y que ellos devuelven a la calle a través del humor, la cultura juvenil y la provocación. Su activismo también se refleja en la solidaridad con Palestina, que ha llevado a la detención de Mo Chara, el miembro más visible de la banda, mostrando cómo opinar puede ser considerado provocación en ciertos contextos del Reino Unido. El vínculo con el fútbol aparece como una extensión natural de su mensaje, ya que las camisetas y cánticos se convierten en símbolos de identidad, memoria y pertenencia cultural. La colaboración con el Bohemian FC para diseñar una camiseta que destina parte de sus ganancias a apoyar la causa palestina ejemplifica cómo la música y el deporte pueden ser plataformas de reivindicación social.

Empresas especializadas como One Hundred Restrooms y 2theloo se encargan de su gestión, ofreciendo instalaciones limpias, con tecnología avanzada y mantenimiento constante, lo que según Adif mejora la percepción de calidad del servicio tras pruebas piloto realizadas desde 2013.

Sin embargo, esta práctica convierte una necesidad fisiológica básica en un servicio de pago, afectando especialmente a personas con bajos ingresos, personas sin hogar, mayores, pacientes con enfermedades como Crohn o colitis ulcerosa, mujeres embarazadas o en periodo de menstruación.

Entró en Estados Unidos en 2019 por la frontera sur y fue liberado con un documento I-220A, que no permite acogerse a la Ley de Ajuste Cubano para obtener residencia permanente. Inicialmente confiaba en que Trump facilitaría la regularización de cubanos en su situación, pero considera que las medidas migratorias de la administración han endurecido su limbo legal, dejándole en incertidumbre junto a otros cientos de miles de compatriotas en idéntica posición. El abogado Mark Prada explica que el I-220A no se reconoce como entrada legal ni como parole, por lo que están litigando en tribunales para que se les conceda ese estatus y puedan ajustar su situación.

Aunque en 2024 se iniciaron algo más de 11.500 viviendas protegidas (un 6 % menos que el año anterior), los datos preliminares de 2025 indican una nueva reducción en el ritmo de construcción, muy lejos de cubrir la elevada demanda existente.

El principal obstáculo señalado por el sector es la baja rentabilidad: los precios máximos establecidos para garantizar la asequibilidad reducen el margen de beneficio a niveles muy bajos (alrededor del 1 %), lo que desincentiva a las promotoras frente a proyectos de vivienda libre más lucrativos. Además, los costes de construcción disparados incrementan el riesgo de pérdidas.

Otro cuello de botella clave es la escasez y lentitud en la disponibilidad de suelo apto, mayoritariamente en manos de administraciones públicas pero con trámites paralizados.

El año comenzó con la habitual calma postnavideña, pero estuvo marcado profundamente por el impacto de la inteligencia artificial en el negocio. Por un lado, las visitas al blog cayeron drásticamente (hasta un 80 %) debido a las respuestas generadas por IA en buscadores que apenas enlazan a fuentes originales; sin embargo, las ventas de hardware repuntaron notablemente gracias a la demanda de potentes estaciones de trabajo y PCs orientados a ejecutar modelos de IA en local, llegando a montar más de una docena de equipos de alto rendimiento.

Se intentó lanzar una sección específica de la tienda dedicada a hardware para IA, pero la fuerte crisis de precios y escasez de memoria RAM y discos duros (con subidas de cientos de euros en configuraciones de 128 GB en pocos meses) obligó a congelar el proyecto.

Según la versión oficial de ICE y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Campos se volvió disruptivo mientras esperaba medicación, fue trasladado a segregación, intentó suicidarse, resistió violentamente al personal y dejó de respirar durante el forcejeo; el personal intentó reanimarlo sin éxito. Sin embargo, un testigo —otro detenido llamado Santos Jesús Flores— asegura que al menos cinco guardias lo esposaron, derribaron al suelo y le aplicaron una llave de estrangulamiento en el cuello hasta que perdió el conocimiento, mientras él repetía 'No puedo respirar'.

Aunque la dirección del partido no ha ofrecido una explicación oficial detallada, distintos medios señalan que la decisión está directamente relacionada con la creciente presión y contestación interna procedente de sectores de su propia base electoral.

Estas críticas se han intensificado especialmente tras el reciente ataque de fuerzas israelíes contra soldados españoles en el Líbano, un episodio que ha generado malestar entre simpatizantes y cuadros del partido.

Estas medidas, derivadas del reglamento (UE) 2023/2842, obligan a los pescadores a pesar y notificar todas las especies capturadas (incluso desde el primer kilogramo) a través del diario electrónico de a bordo antes de llegar a puerto, así como a comunicar con antelación rígida la llegada. El sector considera estas normas inviables para la pesca artesanal y costera, ya que no se adaptan a la realidad del mar, incrementan el riesgo de sanciones económicas graves (incluida la devolución de subvenciones) y pueden poner en peligro la viabilidad de muchas embarcaciones.

Desde Noruega, varios medios y expertos calificaron la acción de 'patética', 'insólita' o 'ridícula', mientras que el Centro del Nobel de la Paz emitió un comunicado recordando que aunque una medalla puede cambiar de propietario, el título de Nobel de la Paz no se transfiere. Las imágenes del encuentro muestran a Machado saliendo del lugar con una bolsa de regalo con el logo de Trump, lo que muchos interpretaron como una escena de sumisión o propaganda política.

Los resultados, basados en mediciones objetivas mediante acelerómetros (en lugar de autoinformes), indican que añadir solo cinco minutos diarios de actividad física de intensidad moderada a vigorosa (como caminar rápido) podría prevenir hasta un 10 % de las muertes en el conjunto de la población adulta si la mayoría lo adoptara. Entre las personas más inactivas, este beneficio individual sería aún mayor.

Además, reducir 30 minutos al día el tiempo sedentario se asocia con una disminución del 7 % en la mortalidad a nivel poblacional.

El anuncio se produjo durante la visita del primer ministro canadiense, Mark Carney, a China, donde se reunió con el presidente Xi Jinping en Pekín.

Según explicó el Ejecutivo canadiense, la rebaja de los aranceles a los vehículos eléctricos chinos forma parte de un acuerdo más amplio que incluye la reducción de gravámenes impuestos por China a productos agrícolas canadienses. Estos productos, clave para la economía de varias provincias del país, se habían visto afectados en los últimos años por tensiones comerciales y medidas restrictivas por parte de Pekín.

El artículo explora cómo el Imperio romano entendió la naturaleza humana y utilizó la prostitución como herramienta de control social y fuente de inteligencia. En Pompeya, el Lupanar destaca por sus grafitis explícitos que revelan nombres, precios, alardes sexuales y hasta comentarios políticos, mostrando un ambiente donde soldados, funcionarios y esclavos compartían información sin filtros. La Subura, barrio marginal cercano al Foro, era un cruce de senadores arruinados, prostitutas y aspirantes a políticos donde circulaban rumores sobre sobornos y alianzas. La prostitución estaba legalizada, gravada y registrada mediante licencias (licentia stupri), lo que permitía al Estado y a los emperadores acceder a datos sensibles para fines políticos, como menciona Suetonio.

El 7 de enero, el agente Jonathan Ross disparó contra Good a través del parabrisas de su coche cuando esta intentaba marcharse del lugar. Aunque los informes médicos apuntan a que recibió cuatro disparos y los vídeos grabados por testigos muestran que trataba de huir sin atacar a nadie, las autoridades defendieron desde el primer momento una versión basada en la autodefensa.

La secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, acusó a Good de “usar su vehículo como arma”, mientras Donald Trump afirmó que había atropellado violentamente al agente que la mató.

Frente al protagonismo casi absoluto que los medios conceden a líderes políticos y militares de edad avanzada —figuras como Donald Trump, Benjamín Netanyahu, Vladímir Putin, Ali Jamenei o Xi Jinping—, el autor cuestiona los motivos reales por los que se les otorga tanta atención. Sus voces, omnipresentes en informativos y debates, generan miedo, tensión y una sensación constante de amenaza global. Se analizan sus palabras, silencios y gestos como si contuvieran verdades trascendentales, cuando en realidad su principal “mérito” es concentrar un poder destructivo sin precedentes: arsenales nucleares, ejércitos masivos y la capacidad de imponer relatos falsos como si fueran verdades incuestionables.

El artículo propone una rebelión simbólica pero profunda: dejar de escuchar esas voces del poder que solo producen temor y empezar a prestar atención a otras mucho más valiosas.

Según esta encuesta, realizada a casi 26.000 personas en 21 países, una mayoría creciente de ciudadanos cree que China será el país que más aumente su influencia global en la próxima década, mientras que Estados Unidos pierde atractivo y liderazgo internacional.

El estudio señala que las políticas de 'America First' impulsadas por Trump han acelerado este cambio de percepción. La imposición de aranceles tanto a aliados como a rivales, el cuestionamiento del sistema tradicional de alianzas liderado por Washington y una retórica abiertamente confrontacional han empujado a numerosos países a estrechar lazos con Pekín. Al mismo tiempo, adversarios históricos de Estados Unidos perciben ahora a Washington como menos temible, interpretando que la era de la hegemonía occidental sin rival ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-sondeo-global-muestra-que-las-politicas-de-trump-refuerzan-la-influencia-internacional-de-china</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/un-sondeo-global-muestra-que-las-politicas-de-trump-refuerzan-la-influencia-internacional-de-china</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:46:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tragedia en Pensilvania: Niño de 11 años asesina a su padre tras una disputa por un videojuego]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un terrible suceso ha conmocionado a Pensilvania, Estados Unidos, donde un niño de 11 años ha sido acusado de matar a su padre a tiros después de que este le retirara su Nintendo Switch. El incidente tuvo lugar en Duncannon Borough, y según los informes policiales, Douglas Dietz, de 42 años, fue encontrado con heridas de bala por su esposa, Jillian Dietz, quien despertó tras escuchar ruidos fuertes y un olor inusual. El menor, adoptado por la pareja en 2018, confesó a la policía haber disparado a su padre, afirmando que se había enfadado cuando le quitaron la consola y le impidieron seguir jugando. Según su relato, encontró la llave de la caja fuerte de su padre, tomó un revólver y lo usó para cometer el crimen. Las autoridades negaron la libertad bajo fianza al menor, quien, en un momento de confusión, declaró a la policía que se odiaba.

Kimmel aseguró que estaría dispuesto a entregar algunos de los premios más importantes de su carrera si Trump aceptaba retirar a dichos agentes y devolverlos a sus cuarteles.

La broma surgió tras la difusión de unas imágenes en las que la líder opositora venezolana María Corina Machado entregaba a Trump la medalla del Premio Nobel de la Paz como gesto simbólico de agradecimiento por su apoyo a la causa venezolana.

En las imágenes, se observa cómo un grupo de aproximadamente una docena de miembros de la tribu emerge de la jungla hasta la orilla de un río, rodeados por una gran cantidad de mariposas. Inicialmente, los indígenas portaban armas y mostraban actitud hostil ante la presencia de los visitantes, pero terminaron calmándose al comprobar que no representaban una amenaza.

El suceso tuvo lugar hace aproximadamente dos semanas y fue revelado por el canal israelí Channel 12, citando fuentes policiales.

De acuerdo con la información publicada, la operación fue llevada a cabo por un batallón de la Brigada Golani, desplegado en los Altos del Golán ocupados. Durante una incursión en Siria, los soldados identificaron un rebaño propiedad de agricultores locales y lo cargaron en camiones que, según las investigaciones, parecían haber sido preparados con antelación.

En ese marco, el presidente subrayó también el papel de la clase trabajadora y, de forma explícita, el de las personas migrantes, afirmando que en España “no sobra nadie” y que, de hecho, el país necesita más mano de obra.

En términos poblacionales, esta realidad afecta a alrededor de 410.000 personas, lo que representa el 7,8 % de la población valenciana.

El informe pone de manifiesto que los problemas de vivienda van mucho más allá de los casos más extremos. Cerca de 1,2 millones de personas tienen dificultades relacionadas con el acceso y mantenimiento de su vivienda.

Pese a ese revés autonómico, el sondeo elaborado bajo la dirección de José Félix Tezanos indica que el impacto no se traslada al conjunto del electorado nacional. En comparación con el barómetro de diciembre, el PP recorta ligeramente la distancia con el PSOE —de nueve puntos a 8,7—, aunque sin alterar el liderazgo socialista.

Este gesto se interpretó como un símbolo máximo de obsecuencia y servilismo hacia el poder, dando origen a la palabra 'secanuca' como sinónimo de persona sumisa ante la autoridad.

El vocablo se popularizó entre los aficionados y explotó a finales de 2025 tras una controvertida decisión de la AFA y la Liga Profesional.

La autora recoge las valoraciones del ex militar noruego Dan-Viggo Bergtun, quien califica la medida como un “fraude financiero”. Bergtun sostiene que la UE se endeuda en los mercados a tipos de interés relativamente altos para, posteriormente, prestar ese dinero a Ucrania sin intereses, asumiendo la Unión las pérdidas anuales derivadas de esa diferencia. Dichas pérdidas, argumenta, acabarán imputándose durante años a los presupuestos europeos, que funcionan como garantía colectiva frente a los inversores.

Esta diferencia representa un 82% más de ingresos para los propietarios, con una brecha económica de 23.638 euros. El estudio, que no incluye datos de País Vasco, Navarra y Cataluña por cuestiones metodológicas, señala que en ocho comunidades autónomas (Comunidad Valenciana, Extremadura, Murcia, Castilla-La Mancha, Galicia, Canarias, Cantabria y Asturias) los propietarios duplican los ingresos de los inquilinos. El Ministerio alerta de que la renovación masiva de contratos en 2026 y 2027 —afectando a más de 2,7 millones de personas— podría agrandar aún más esta brecha si los alquileres se actualizan a precios de mercado, incrementando la renta mediana de los caseros hasta unos 54.665 euros de media.

Guthrie vivió en el complejo de apartamentos Beach Haven, en Brooklyn, propiedad de Fred Trump, y denunció en sus letras cómo este empresario establecía una 'línea de color' que impedía el acceso a personas negras, fomentando el odio racial para beneficio propio.

El texto también menciona la detención de Fred Trump en 1927 durante un altercado en una marcha del Ku Klux Klan en Queens (Nueva York), aunque no hay pruebas concluyentes de que fuera miembro o simpatizante activo del grupo, ya que fue liberado sin cargos.

Los hechos se produjeron el pasado 8 de enero y, según la investigación, no se trataron de un ataque aislado, sino del desenlace de varios días de acoso previo a través de redes sociales.

De acuerdo con el testimonio de la víctima, desde días antes del secuestro venía recibiendo amenazas e insultos por parte de personas vinculadas al entorno de las agresoras, que la acusaban de haber mantenido una relación con el marido de una de ellas. La joven rechaza categóricamente dicha acusación. La situación pasó del hostigamiento digital a la violencia física cuando fue interceptada en plena calle, introducida por la fuerza en el maletero de un vehículo y trasladada hasta un piso situado en la zona de El Ruedo.

El plan, impulsado por el alcalde Javier Lacalle y el Partido Popular, contemplaba reducir carriles de tráfico y sustituir aparcamientos gratuitos por plazas subterráneas de pago, con un coste de ocho millones de euros, en un contexto de fuertes recortes sociales. Tras meses de protestas pacíficas ignoradas, el inicio de las obras provocó una reacción espontánea del vecindario que derivó en manifestaciones masivas, enfrentamientos con la policía y una intensa movilización social.

El texto destaca cómo el conflicto se amplificó rápidamente gracias a las redes sociales, convirtiendo a Gamonal en un símbolo de resistencia ciudadana frente a la corrupción, el despilfarro y la connivencia entre poder político y económico.

Las autoridades sanitarias alertan de que, si la transmisión continúa, el país podría perder el estatus de eliminación del sarampión alcanzado en el año 2000.

Los estados con casos activos son Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Carolina del Norte, Ohio, Oregón, Carolina del Sur, Utah y Virginia.

A pesar del éxito quirúrgico, los traslados eran caóticos, ruidosos y descoordinados, lo que provocaba errores técnicos y omisiones de información crítica.

Inspirados tras ver una parada en boxes de Fórmula 1 en televisión, los profesores Martin Elliott y Allan Goldman decidieron pedir ayuda a equipos de F1. Inicialmente contactaron con McLaren, que propuso una costosa mesa-cama multifuncional que el sistema sanitario británico no podía asumir. Más tarde, gracias a un contacto de Shell, colaboraron con Ferrari en Maranello.

La medalla incluía dos placas añadidas.

Trump aceptó el obsequio y lo calificó en Truth Social como un 'gran honor' y un 'gesto maravilloso de respeto mutuo', atribuyéndose los méritos 'por el trabajo que yo he hecho'.

Por un lado, se ha aplicado una subida salarial del 1,5% en las retribuciones de los diputados con efectos desde enero, siguiendo el decreto ley aprobado en diciembre de 2025 que regula las subidas para el sector público (2,5% en 2025 y 1,5% en 2026). Existe la posibilidad de un incremento adicional del 0,5% si la inflación supera el 1,5% al cierre del año, abonándose en el año siguiente. Esta decisión se adoptó con el apoyo de la mayoría de grupos, la abstención de Junts y el voto en contra de Vox, aunque tanto PP como Vox criticaron la aprobación por decreto sin negociación previa.

Por otro lado, se ha modificado el calendario de plenos para ampliar los días libres de los diputados, adaptándolos a los festivos de todas las comunidades autónomas, al menos entre febrero y junio. De esta forma, no se celebrarán sesiones en fechas como el 23 de abril (Día de Aragón y Castilla y León) ni el 9 de j]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-congreso-aplica-a-los-diputados-la-subida-salarial-del-1-5-para-2026-y-adapta-el-calendario-de-plenos-a-festivos-autonomicos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/el-congreso-aplica-a-los-diputados-la-subida-salarial-del-1-5-para-2026-y-adapta-el-calendario-de-plenos-a-festivos-autonomicos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:02:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nuevas evidencias de actividad neandertal en el Complejo de Cuevas de Gorham, en Gibraltar]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Complejo de Cuevas de Gorham, situado en la costa oriental de Gibraltar, sigue aportando información clave para comprender la presencia humana en el extremo sur de Europa durante la prehistoria. Investigaciones arqueológicas recientes han permitido acceder a un sistema de cuevas y a una cámara que había permanecido sellada durante unos 40.000 años, lo que ha abierto nuevas líneas de estudio sobre los neandertales que habitaron la zona.

Aunque el complejo fue descubierto a comienzos del siglo XX, no fue hasta la década de 1980 cuando se iniciaron excavaciones sistemáticas. Desde entonces, los trabajos han revelado abundantes indicios de actividad humana que se remontan hasta hace aproximadamente 100.000 años. A pesar de que no se han hallado restos óseos ni de neandertales ni de Homo sapiens, el registro arqueológico es especialmente rico en materiales asociados a la vida cotidiana.

Miles de personas han salido a las calles para protestar contra lo que consideran un abuso de poder por parte del ICE, que actúa con el respaldo del Gobierno de Trump en la detención y deportación de migrantes. Durante una rueda de prensa, la jefa de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karoline Leavitt, defendió al agente implicado y culpabilizó indirectamente a la víctima, llegando a cuestionar la profesionalidad de un periodista que la interpeló. Este hecho ha generado una ola de críticas hacia la Administración por la percepción de que respalda comportamientos violentos de sus agentes.

Así lo concluye el Consejo Asesor Científico de las Academias Europeas (EASAC), que estima que el coste necesario para restaurar ecosistemas degradados en la Unión Europea, unos 150.000 millones de euros, se vería ampliamente compensado por beneficios que alcanzarían los 1,8 billones de euros. Estos beneficios provendrían principalmente de la reducción del riesgo de catástrofes naturales, la mayor estabilidad de los sistemas alimentarios e hídricos y el descenso del gasto sanitario y de recuperación tras eventos extremos.

Según EASAC, los ecosistemas europeos se encuentran gravemente deteriorados: apenas el 1,4 % de los bosques permanece intacto y solo el 3,3 % del territorio tiene una intervención humana mínima. Esta degradación está directamente relacionada con un aumento de inundaciones, incendios forestales, pérdida de fertili]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restaurar-la-naturaleza-en-europa-una-inversion-clave-para-reducir-riesgos-y-fortalecer-la-economia</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/restaurar-la-naturaleza-en-europa-una-inversion-clave-para-reducir-riesgos-y-fortalecer-la-economia</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:16:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Inditex cerrará la primera tienda de Zara en A Coruña tras 50 años y trasladará a su plantilla]]></title><description><![CDATA[Inditex ha decidido cerrar la histórica tienda de Zara situada en la calle Juan Flórez de A Coruña, el primer establecimiento de la marca, que bajará la persiana el próximo 30 de enero tras medio siglo de actividad. La decisión, comunicada al personal y a la propiedad del inmueble, responde a la estrategia del grupo de concentrar su actividad comercial en menos tiendas, pero de mayor tamaño y con una oferta más integrada.

El local, con unos 300 metros cuadrados, ha funcionado en los últimos meses como espacio conmemorativo del 50 aniversario de Zara, convertido casi en un museo efímero de la marca. Sin embargo, ya no encaja en los estándares actuales de Inditex, que prioriza espacios amplios donde conviven varias líneas —mujer, hombre, niño y, en algunos casos, Zara Home— y una experiencia de compra más completa y digitalizada.

Este artículo indica que un Estado miembro que se encuentre atrasado en el pago de sus cuotas para los gastos de la organización no podrá votar en la Asamblea General si la deuda es igual o superior al total de las cuotas de los dos años anteriores. No obstante, la Asamblea General podría permitir el voto si se determina que el retraso se debe a causas ajenas a la voluntad del país. En 2025, Estados Unidos no abonó sus cuotas, lo que podría llevar a la suspensión temporal de su derecho a voto si la situación persiste.

Durante la actuación policial, el padre, que se encontraba en situación irregular, fue reducido violentamente, mientras que Arnoldo, ciudadano estadounidense y menor de edad, fue sometido a una maniobra de estrangulamiento que le dificultó la respiración.

A pesar de que el adolescente informó a los agentes de su condición de ciudadano y de su edad, la intervención no se detuvo.

A diferencia de los superrobots de la época, los ATs eran lentos, frágiles y cada enfrentamiento tenía consecuencias palpables, lo que otorgaba a la serie un aura de realismo único. La nueva producción contará con animación moderna a cargo del estudio Production I.G y buscará mantener el tono oscuro y crudo de la serie original, incorporando además la visión filosófica y estética característica de Oshii, conocida por explorar temas de política, moralidad y existencia humana.

La escasez de chips y el aumento de precios han generado un mercado complicado, especialmente en la DDR5, mientras que la DDR4 sigue siendo más asequible aunque también ha sufrido subidas. Existen varias estrategias para adaptarse a esta situación. Una opción es volver a PCs con DDR4, lo que permite ahorrar entre un 30% y un 40% respecto a la DDR5, aunque implica usar placas base y procesadores más antiguos, como AM4 en AMD o LGA1700 en Intel. Otra alternativa es montar uno mismo los chips DDR5, comprando los componentes por separado y soldándolos, algo que solo es viable para quienes tengan experiencia avanzada en electrónica. También se pueden usar adaptadores de SO-DIMM a DIMM, aprovechando la RAM de portátiles que actualmente tiene mejor stock y precio.

Se define como parte de una generación de 'hijos de la calle', marcada por la libertad, el juego al aire libre y una relación muy directa con el entorno natural y social del pueblo.

Por primera vez en al menos diez años, la capital británica se convierte en el lugar del Reino Unido donde es más probable vender una vivienda con pérdidas. En 2025, el 14,8% de los vendedores londinenses cerraron operaciones por debajo del precio de compra, frente a una media nacional del 8,7%, según datos de la inmobiliaria Hamptons. Distritos como Tower Hamlets, símbolo del auge financiero de los años 2000, concentran el ajuste, con casi un 30% de ventas en negativo.

El cambio no responde solo a un ciclo económico adverso, sino a un giro estructural del modelo que convirtió a Londres en una ‘ciudad-activo’. Durante décadas, el mercado se sostuvo sobre la llegada masiva de capital extranjero, atraído por la estabilidad jurídica y un marco fiscal favorable. Muchas viviendas funcionaban más como instrumentos financieros que como hogares, desligando los preci]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/londres-entra-en-fase-de-ajuste-inmobiliario-tras-una-decada-de-subidas-continuas</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/londres-entra-en-fase-de-ajuste-inmobiliario-tras-una-decada-de-subidas-continuas</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:44:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Más de un centenar de menores muertos en Gaza durante la tregua, según datos de Unicef]]></title><description><![CDATA[Más de 100 niños han muerto en la Franja de Gaza desde la entrada en vigor del alto el fuego acordado entre Israel y Hamás el 10 de octubre, según datos recopilados por Unicef. La agencia de Naciones Unidas advierte de que esta cifra podría ser mayor, ya que solo incluye los casos en los que se dispone de información suficiente y verificada. Del total de víctimas infantiles contabilizadas, 60 eran niños y 40 niñas, y la mayoría de las muertes se produjeron como consecuencia directa de acciones militares.

Unicef señala que los fallecimientos se deben principalmente a ataques aéreos, bombardeos con drones, disparos de tanques, armas de fuego y el uso de cuadricópteros armados. Un número menor de víctimas se ha visto afectado por la explosión de munición sin detonar abandonada en zonas habitadas, lo que pone de relieve el peligro persistente para la población civil incluso durante la tregua.

Según Leavitt, el comentario fue hecho de forma facetiosa, en el contexto de que su administración está haciendo un gran trabajo y cumpliendo con lo que los estadounidenses esperaban, por lo que «quizá deberíamos seguir adelante» sin interrupciones.

Las declaraciones de Trump surgieron mientras expresaba su frustración por la tendencia histórica de que el partido del presidente en ejercicio pierde escaños en las elecciones de mitad de mandato (midterms). Trump reconoció que «es algo psicológico profundo», pero que cuando se gana la presidencia, normalmente no se ganan las midterm. A continuación, presumió de sus logros y añadió que, pensándolo bien, «no deberíamos tener siquiera elecciones».

Trump respondió visiblemente molesto, profiriendo un 'f*ck you' y mostrando el dedo medio, gesto captado en vídeo que se volvió viral rápidamente.

Como consecuencia, Ford decidió suspender sin sueldo al trabajador de forma inmediata, medida que la empresa justificó por falta de respeto en sus instalaciones. La Casa Blanca calificó al obrero como 'un individuo desequilibrado en una crisis de ira'.

Conocido como 'el último templario', Tomás se instaló en la década de 1990 en la aldea abandonada de Manjarín, situada a más de 1.500 metros de altitud cerca de la Cruz de Ferro, uno de los puntos más emblemáticos y duros del itinerario jacobeo.

Tras una vida que incluyó años en la Legión y experiencias en Madrid, decidió convertirse en hospitalero en este lugar inhóspito, ofreciendo refugio sencillo, café caliente y una acogida muy especial a los peregrinos, sin agua corriente ni electricidad convencional. Se consideraba heredero espiritual de la Orden del Temple y recreaba en su albergue un ambiente cargado de simbolismo templario, con ceremonias diarias de oración por la paz y rituales sincréticos.

La mayoría de estas trabajadoras, que cobran alrededor de 950 euros netos al mes, denuncian que elaboran productos de alto valor —como abrigos de 4.000 euros o bolsos de más de 2.000— mientras perciben salarios muy bajos en un contexto de fuerte aumento del coste de la vida.

El conflicto surge tras meses de negociación sin acuerdo, ya que la dirección de la empresa presentó una propuesta de incremento salarial que el sindicato CIG califica de «insulto» y «miserable», con mejoras mínimas (apenas un 0,2 % adicional en algunos tramos de antigüedad) que solo afectarían a un reducido número de personas y supondrían un coste mensual muy bajo para la compañía en comparación con sus ingresos.

Diversos documentos y estudios académicos confirman que el Gobierno de Estados Unidos valoró seriamente la posibilidad de ocupar Canarias como parte de su estrategia naval en el Atlántico. La importancia del Archipiélago radicaba en su ubicación geográfica, clave en las rutas marítimas que conectaban Europa, África y América, un factor esencial para una potencia en plena expansión militar y comercial.

Dentro de las Islas, Tenerife concentró la mayor atención de los planificadores militares estadounidenses. Informes elaborados por el agregado naval William S.

Durante la reunión, Trump y Machado habrían abordado la situación de los derechos humanos en Venezuela, el deterioro de las instituciones democráticas y el impacto de la crisis económica y humanitaria sobre la población venezolana.

Según diversas fuentes periodísticas (principalmente NewsWire), Bruselas impulsa este esquema para cubrir las escasez de mano de obra existentes en ambos territorios. De aprobarse, permitiría a los ciudadanos australianos residir y trabajar en cualquiera de los 27 países de la UE —entre ellos Francia, Alemania, Italia, España, Países Bajos o Irlanda— durante un periodo de hasta cuatro años, sin necesidad de tener un empleo precontratado antes de llegar.

La historia transcurre en octubre de 1889: una explosión en el Club Diógenes deja gravemente herido a Mycroft Holmes, hermano de Sherlock, lo que sume al famoso detective en una profunda depresión. El doctor Watson debe investigar por su cuenta para encontrar pistas que reactiven el interés de Holmes por el caso.

La jugabilidad es continuista: inicialmente controlamos a Watson y, tras motivar a Holmes, pasamos a manejarlo a él.

Sin embargo, esta contracción de la mano de obra inmigrante no se tradujo en mejores resultados laborales para los nacidos en EE. UU. Al contrario, la tasa de desempleo de este grupo aumentó del 3,7 % en diciembre de 2024 al 4,1 % en diciembre de 2025, lo que supone un incremento del 11 % en un año.

Además, se estudiará un coeficiente reductor para que las horas de guardia coticen y permitan adelantar la jubilación, aunque esto depende de la Seguridad Social. Entre las mejoras retributivas destaca el aumento salarial para los médicos internos residentes (MIR), que sitúa a Asturias como la tercera comunidad mejor pagadora, con un incremento de unos 50 euros sobre la media nacional y un primer año en torno a 1.440 euros brutos.

Se priorizarán nueve sectores estratégicos para mejorar la productividad: vivienda, energía, digitalización, inteligencia artificial, reindustrialización, economía circular, infraestructuras, agu]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-anuncia-el-fondo-soberano-espana-crece-con-10-500-millones-iniciales-para-movilizar-hasta-120-000-millones-en-inversion</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/pedro-sanchez-anuncia-el-fondo-soberano-espana-crece-con-10-500-millones-iniciales-para-movilizar-hasta-120-000-millones-en-inversion</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:10:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Informe revela agresiones sexuales sistemáticas contra trabajadores agrícolas tailandeses en Israel]]></title><description><![CDATA[Un informe presentado durante la Comisión Especial de la Knesset sobre Trabajadores Extranjeros ha revelado que todos los trabajadores tailandeses encuestados en la agricultura israelí han sufrido algún tipo de agresión sexual. De los 654 trabajadores cuestionados, cada uno declaró haber sido víctima de acoso. Los expertos responsables del estudio, el Dr. Yahel Kurlander y el Dr. Shahar Shoham, señalaron que el Estado de Israel ha dejado desprotegidas a estas trabajadoras. La comisionada de los derechos de los trabajadores extranjeros, Shiri Lev-Ran, explicó que si una trabajadora presenta una queja, corre el riesgo de perder tanto su empleo como su residencia en el país. Además, algunas trabajadoras desconocen la totalidad de sus derechos. Representantes de la Policía de Israel y del Instituto Nacional de Seguros reconocieron que sus sistemas carecen de datos completos sobre denuncias de inmigrantes y trabajadores extranjeros, lo que dificulta el seguimiento y la protección efectiva. ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/informe-revela-agresiones-sexuales-sistematicas-contra-trabajadores-agricolas-tailandeses-en-israel</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/informe-revela-agresiones-sexuales-sistematicas-contra-trabajadores-agricolas-tailandeses-en-israel</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:28:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reseña de 'Villano Principiante', una comedia ligera de supervillanos de John Scalzi]]></title><description><![CDATA[La noticia es una reseña personal del libro 'Villano Principiante' de John Scalzi, centrada tanto en la obra como en el contexto actual de las traducciones no oficiales impulsadas por la inteligencia artificial. El autor del texto explica cómo llegó a leer esta novela a través de una traducción automática no oficial, una práctica cada vez más habitual en géneros minoritarios como la ciencia ficción, donde muchos títulos tardan en publicarse en español o directamente no llegan a hacerlo.

El artículo reflexiona sobre cómo antes estas traducciones eran realizadas por aficionados con buen dominio del idioma original, mientras que ahora se recurre directamente a sistemas de IA, con resultados desiguales. En el caso concreto de esta novela, la traducción es generalmente comprensible gracias al estilo sencillo de Scalzi, aunque presenta errores llamativos, especialmente en el uso del género de los personajes, lo que rompe la inmersión en algunos momentos.

En cuanto al contenido del libro, s]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-villano-principiante-una-comedia-ligera-de-supervillanos-de-john-scalzi</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/resena-de-villano-principiante-una-comedia-ligera-de-supervillanos-de-john-scalzi</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:18:00 +0200</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel presenta Panther Lake (Core Ultra Series 3): tercera generación con proceso 18A para portátiles]]></title><description><![CDATA[Intel ha anunciado oficialmente Panther Lake, correspondiente a la tercera generación de sus procesadores Intel Core Ultra (denominados también Core Ultra Series 3), diseñados principalmente para ordenadores portátiles. Estos chips marcan un hito al ser los primeros en utilizar en parte el avanzado nodo de fabricación Intel 18A (equivalente a unos 2 nm), centrado en el tile de cómputo que incluye los núcleos de CPU y la NPU para inteligencia artificial.

Manteniendo la arquitectura de chiplets, el procesador integra distintos componentes: el tile de cómputo se fabrica en 18A, mientras que otros elementos como la gráfica integrada o la controladora se producen en nodos más maduros de TSMC o Intel. La compañía ha establecido tres familias principales según la configuración:
- Modelos 'Core X' (alta gama): 16 núcleos de CPU y gráfica con 12 núcleos Xe3, compatibles con memoria LPDDR5X hasta 9600 MT/s.
- Modelos de 16 núcleos sin 'X': misma cantidad de CPU pero solo 4 núcleos gráficos.

Horn, educador de profesión, acudió acompañado de su hermano Amos, quien no fue secuestrado. Ayuso destacó el testimonio de Horn y subrayó uno de sus mayores lamentos: la participación de un niño palestino armado en su secuestro, lo que refleja las duras condiciones vividas en los túneles de Gaza. La presidenta agradeció la visita y expresó su deseo de que el tercer hermano, Iair Horn, quien fue liberado previamente en febrero de 2025 tras 498 días de cautiverio por su diabetes, regrese pronto libre a la Comunidad de Madrid. Este encuentro se enmarca en el contexto de la reciente liberación de Eitan en octubre de ]]></description><link>https://killbait.com/posts/page/isabel-diaz-ayuso-recibe-en-madrid-a-eitan-horn-exsecuestrado-por-hamas-durante-dos-anos</link><guid>https://killbait.com/posts/page/isabel-diaz-ayuso-recibe-en-madrid-a-eitan-horn-exsecuestrado-por-hamas-durante-dos-anos</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:00:00 +0200</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
